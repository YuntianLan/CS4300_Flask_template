When she was younger she was hopeful that she could escape the criminal life and strove for something better. But as she grew older she realized that because of all the bad things she had done, there was no escaping the criminal life. Despite having grown up on the streets, she was able to adapt to a lusher lifestyle and fit in with the Crimson Dawn gang. Having known Han for so many years, she believed she may have been the one person who could see him for who he truly was, thinking he was “the good guy”.[1] She was a fighter and had been trained in combat by Vos, which helped her survive.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": ["Qi'ra aboard the Millennium Falcon"]}
