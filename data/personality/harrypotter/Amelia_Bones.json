{"id": "Amelia_Bones", "name": "Amelia Bones", "fandom": "harrypotter", "url": "https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Amelia_Bones", "personality": ["Amelia Bones was a serious, but fair person who did not overlook obvious points. She gave Harry Potter and Mrs Figg a chance to testify, and was also one to be impressed with remarkable feats, given her admiration of Harry's production of a corporeal Patronus at such a young age. Unbiased and firm, she did not cave into Fudge's intimidation and corrupt authority, and even openly expressed her friendliness with Arthur Weasley, a known supporter of Dumbledore and Harry, even in Fudge's presence, whereas many other coworkers avoided him out of fear of the Minister threatening to fire anyone in league with them.\n", "Besides this, Amelia was a courageous woman, putting up a valiant fight against Voldemort himself despite knowing that she would more than likely perish, though she was ultimately killed. It is also very likely that she was kind, given the fact that Susan Bones, her niece, was upset when she died.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
