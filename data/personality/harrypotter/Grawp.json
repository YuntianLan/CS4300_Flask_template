Despite this, Grawp loved his brother dearly and was badly upset when left alone in June of 1996.[17]\n", "However, while his language skills were still barely comprehensible, Grawp's personality on the other hand changed immensely under Hagrid's influence, despite doubts that Hagrid's efforts were completely futile. By the time he attended the funeral of Albus Dumbledore, Grawp became more kind, gentle, and compassionate. He showed sorrow during the funeral and attempted to comfort Hagrid, who was more devastated by Dumbledore's death, by patting and embracing him. Grawp also showed happiness and joy after Voldemort's final defeat, demonstrating that he had developed an understanding of human emotions. However, while most of his violent side was lost, he still retained some of it when he fought against the other giants during the Battle of Hogwarts.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": ["Grawp and Umbridge in the Forbidden Forest"]}
