{"id": "Poppy_Pomfrey", "name": "Poppy Pomfrey", "fandom": "harrypotter", "url": "https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Poppy_Pomfrey", "personality": ["Madam Pomfrey was described by her students as being exceptionally kind, but even more so strict.[4] She was very obsessive, lining up the her patients' sweet boxes in neat rows, and was intensely worried about all of the students under her care, believing even feasts to be risky.[4] Working in a school where magical accidents were almost an undeniable certainty, she appeared to have resigned herself to treating whoever came her way. Indeed, she never asked questions about how her patients received their ailments or questioning the sometimes ludicrous stories they told her, but instead immediately set to fixing them up.[14]\n", " She had a tendency to burst into tears at moments where great sorrow was appropriate, but she was capable of controlling herself if need be. She also has her standards and loyalty, as she would have resigned in protest when Minerva McGonagall was shot down by four Stunning Spells from a cowardly Ministry attack, were she not worried for the students.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
