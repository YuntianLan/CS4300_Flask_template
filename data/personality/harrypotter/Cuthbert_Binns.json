{"id": "Cuthbert_Binns", "name": "Cuthbert Binns", "fandom": "harrypotter", "url": "https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cuthbert_Binns", "personality": ["Professor Binns did not display much of a personality, as all he did was read his notes in a droning voice to his students, while oblivious or uncaring about how everyone simply dozes off from boredom. However, it can be seen that he was very impatient and did not take the liberty of learning his students' names, calling Hermione Granger \"Miss Grant\", Parvati Patil \"Miss Pennyfeather\", Seamus Finnigan \"O'Flaherty\" and even the famous Harry Potter \"Perkins\". It's possible he was actually calling them by the names of previous students from years ago, possibly due to senility as he was very old at the time of death. Binns was also shown to be a firm disbeliever in legends and mythology, dedicating his studies and lectures on \"solid, believable fact\". He is said to have a drawling monotonous voice, which most of his students had become bored with.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
