He was a committed, steady and practical by-the-book intelligence officer with a fair amount of combat experience. Andor often kept quiet and reserved, a trait he had acquired due to his experience in war. Although fighting on the side of the Rebel Alliance, he'd been hardened by war to the point that he did not hesitate to commit morally questionable acts when necessary. However, Cassian is shown to still feel some degree of remorse and regret after some of this events, for example, when he had to execute Tivik during the mission to Kafrene.[2]\n", "In a briefing to Commander Mon Mothma, General Draven described Andor as \"one of the most capable agents within Rebel Intelligence,\" with the ability to handle a wide range of missions, from reconnaissance to assassination and sabotage. Draven also said that Andor was capable of analyzing intelligence and acting on that intelligence without the need to contact superiors. Draven indicated that, since Andor worked for the rebellion since childhood, that the Alliance was like his family and that his loyalty was unwavering. Mothma, however, worried about the terrible things Andor and other Rebel agents were asked to do in the name of the Rebellion. Mothma wondered if command was doing enough to help agents like Andor to cope with the psychological damage inflicted by their actions.[7]\n"], "quotes": [["\"Does he look like a killer?\"\"No. He has the face of a friend.\"", "―Chirrut Îmwe and Baze Malbus[src]"]], "figure_captions": []}
