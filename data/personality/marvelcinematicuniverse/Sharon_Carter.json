She holds a high opinion of and belief in Steve Rogers, due to stories of him passed down from her aunt and from how often the two would see each other due to her being assigned to watch over him; during this assignment, the two developed a romantic interest in one another, eventually sharing a kiss, the two of them joking that it was \"late\". Because of this, she sided with him despite Rogers protecting the very man which the organization she was by then working for was after, and accepted the trouble she would be in for it.\n", "Sharon was in great awe of the life her aunt Peggy had lived; at Peggy's funeral, Sharon mentioned a picture of Peggy standing next to JFK, describing it as \"cool\" but \"a lot to live up to\". Because of this, she never told anyone prior to this that the two were related, but was nonetheless determined to follow in her footsteps, leading her into joining S.H.I.E.L.D. She was loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D right up until its collapse following HYDRA's uprising, after which she joined the CIA.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
