He often wore ornate clothing that included a cape.[3] In his youth, Calrissian enjoyed playing sabacc,[12] and Solo described him as having been a scoundrel.[3] Calrissian was also willing to undertaking dangerous risks. On one occasion, he, Lobot, and some companions stole the Emperor's luxury yacht Imperialis.[24] Calrissian hoped to profit from selling the ship's treasures.[25] The heist undertook a dangerous turn when the Sith objects aboard corrupted his companions Aleksin, Pavol,[27] and Korin Pers.[28] Calrissian had little appreciation for the Sith and Jedi, regarding them as \"con-jobs.\"[27]\n", "He was also familiar with the bounty Cha, which led her to spare his life.[27] Calrissian cared deeply for his friend Lobot and was unwilling to abandon him. The two were close friends. Lobot recognized Calrissian's charm and ability to motivate people and counseled him to find a greater cause than himself and to do good for others.[28]\n", "After losing the Millennium Falcon however, Calrissian sought to turn into a respectable businessman, and he turned Cloud City into a mostly-legitimate enterprise.[12] He was protective of his people to the point that he betrayed Solo and the Rebels to save Cloud City from the wrath of the Empire, for whom Calrissian had no love. He turned against the Empire, however, in order to give his citizens a chance to escape and to save Solo. Although Solo had felt betrayed by Calrissian's actions,[3] the two reconciled after Solo was rescued from Tatooine, and shared a warm embrace during the victory celebration on Endor.[7] When speaking or referring to Solo by his first name, Calrissian invariably pronounced the name the same way one would pronounce the word \"hand,\" rather than rhyming with \"on\" as it was normally pronounced.[6]\n", "Calrissian was known for his jocular and witty personality. Despite the wartime damage to Cloud City, Calrissian was undaunted and preferred to look on the bright side of things by hiring refugees to staff his facilities. Calrissian was also a smooth-talking negotiator who managed to convince several Imperial holdouts to surrender in return for being well-treated and allowed to leave Cloud City. Calrissian was also a man of honor who kept his promises. The only person that could exert an influence on Calrissian was his friend and employee Lobot. Calrissian welcomed the news that his friends Solo and Organa were expecting a child and looked forward to being an uncle.[33]\n"], "quotes": [["\"He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel.
