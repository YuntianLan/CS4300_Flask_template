Like Tywin, he was willing to work with rivals even if he didn't trust them, as demonstrated by his offering Olenna Tyrell a place in the Small Council. He was always content with being a follower rather than a leader but could take charge when the situation demanded it, chastising Cersei for not teaching Tommen how to rule and trying to act above her position as Queen Mother, culminating in him becoming Hand of the King at Pycelle's request. Also, Kevan was somewhat perceptive in a way, deducing how Cersei was opting to line the Small Council with sycophants like Qyburn and fools like Mace Tyrell - he was visibly distasteful of such an act.\n", "Alas, he did not know Cersei as well as Tywin, and did not, like everyone else, foresee his fate in the Great Sept of Baelor. Not sensing Cersei's great foolishness in destroying their most powerful ally for when the Lannisters are vulnerable, or her ruthlessness in burning the Sept.\n"], "personality_quotes": [], "figure_captions": [], "quote": ["I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern.
