When he first came into Hogwarts, he was excited about everything. He was also a fan of some wizarding \"celebrities\", such as Harry Potter and Gilderoy Lockhart. It's possible he had a bit of hero worship for Harry, as he was constantly in awe of anything Harry said or did in their first year together. The night he was attacked by the basilisk he was presumed to be trying to sneak into the hospital wing to visit Harry. During the Triwizard Tournament he and his brother tried to bewitch a number of \"Potter Stinks\" badges to support Harry, which backfired as they only made the badges say \"Potter Really Stinks\". This hero worship may have reached its peak when he returned to Hogwarts despite not being a student anymore to help defend it against the forces of Lord Voldemort.\n", "He always took pictures in his first year, which could lead to him being often annoying. This was partly due to him taking pictures at inopportune moments, such as when Ron was belching slugs and Harry lost the bones in his arm. It was due to this behaviour that some assumed he had been chosen for an attack by the monster in the Chamber of Secrets. \n", "Colin was also brave, as he fought at the Battle of Hogwarts against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, even he was outright not allowed by Professor McGonagall, which he defied by sneaking back in, and was killed during the battle.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
