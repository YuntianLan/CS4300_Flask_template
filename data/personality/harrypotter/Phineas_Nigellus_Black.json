He also seemed to support blood purity since he looked down on Muggle-borns and even used the offensive term Mudblood.\n"], "personality_quotes": [["\"Never try to understand the students.

He attended Hogwarts as a member of Slytherin House, later becoming the school's least popular Headmaster, loathing his profession. Following his death in 1925, his portrait was hung in the Headmaster's office to offer advice to the current headmaster.\n"}
