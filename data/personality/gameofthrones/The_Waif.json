She had a cold disposition that seldom broke, but did nothing whatsoever to conceal her violent and vindictive mentality, which she mostly directed at Arya Stark. Much like Jaqen H'ghar, she was stony and calm in demeanor, but unlike the older man she did not bother to hide her capacity for brutality to the people she disliked—that being said, she was visibly frightened and subservient to Jaqen. She condescended to Arya continuously, and proved to be sadistic towards her when Arya was blinded, taunting her with the fact that her blindness prevented her from being talked to by everyone else around her. When Arya was blinded, she took the opportunity to use the Stark girl's Faceless Men training as an excuse to beat and abuse her for her own satisfaction, and she proved angry and humiliated when Arya began to match her. Her sadistic streak was also prominent in the way she blatantly ignored Jaqen's order to not let Arya suffer, instead repeatedly stabbing her in the stomach, which would be a painful death, and that she violently killed Lady Crane and later taunted Arya with the prospect that Crane's death could have been painless if she had done her job correctly.\n"], "personality_quotes": [], "figure_captions": [], "quote": ["The Waif: \"You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect.
