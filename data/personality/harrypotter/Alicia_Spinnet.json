She did also care about her friends, as she was afraid for Harry Potter's life while a bludger was chasing him. Furthermore, she strongly disliked those with pure-blood supremacist views, such as Draco Malfoy, and believed that no differences exist between pure-bloods and muggle-borns, as she screamed to Malfoy \"How dare you!\", when he called Hermione Granger a \"mudblood\". She was also brave, as she was sorted at Gryffindor house, and was a member of Dumbledore's Army in order to oppose Dolores Umbridge. Furthermore, she fought at the Battle of Hogwarts in order to help defeat the Death Eaters and win the final battle, showing her to be very courageous and determined indeed. \n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": ["Alicia playing Quidditch with Fred and George"]}
