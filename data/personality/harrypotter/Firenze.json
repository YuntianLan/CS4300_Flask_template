Whereas most centaurs believed it was shameful to work alongside humans, Firenze was happy to allow Harry to ride him and became a teacher in Hogwarts.\n", "Firenze was willing to stand up for what he believed in even if it meant defying his colony; unfortunately this resulted in him nearly being stomped to death by the other centaurs.\n", "He was friendly with Hagrid, and seemed to get on quite well with Harry Potter, who was on speaking terms with him unlike most students, who initially found him intimidating.\n", "Like all centaurs, Firenze commonly tried to read the future in the stars, and Ron Weasley considered him to be a slightly better teacher than Sybill Trelawney, though he was still frustrated that Firenze seemed to be able to provide very little definite information.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": ["Firenze telling Harry about the unicorn in the Forbidden Forest"]}
