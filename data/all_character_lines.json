He's going home, if he's alive.", "How about that jeep?", "A half-track, anything.", "White-walls?", "I changed my mind.", "I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.", "That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.", "There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.", "Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.", "Sure, you got one?", "Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.", "Those guns are close.", "You don't count.", "Same place we are.", "Plenty.", "What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.", "Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.", "A machine gun.", "Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.", "Did he see any sign of them?", "I don't expect to live that long.", "I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.", "Some.", "It seemed appropriate.", "I've been humming it.", "It looks like a Renoir. You think the rest of us were?", "Sarge?", "Upham? Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.", "It was nothing.", "DASHES across the street.", "Glad of it. That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.", "FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!", "Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive. Out of the mouth of babes.", "We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.", "Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.", "Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable. But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.", "Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.", "Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.", "You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.", "No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.", "I think you're right, Keith.", "That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.", "Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.", "Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.", "It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men. No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?", "She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.", "You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?", "Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?", "What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off? Let's just find someplace.", "Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.", "More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on... SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge. About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.", "Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.", "How about you shut up and take your position?", "How about you take your position?", "Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that? I'll be alright.", "No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.", "A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading. It doesn't take this.", "Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.", "You never know.", "If we stayed, we could make a difference.", "Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.", "They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.", "They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.", "Nope.", "Since when have things been normal?", "Maybe.", "Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.", "That's not what we're here for.", "PUSH!", "Yep, hell of a mission.", "A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead. Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred-and-First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works.  We're going in blind.", "Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot. I've got a line on one.", "What about Talbot?", "Okay, Wade.  Translators?", "I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.", "Simpson.", "Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.", "I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.", "Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.", "Worked, didn't it? I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.", "GO!", "Goddamn it! Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.", "FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.", "Here they come. Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:", "I wonder if his cabin is still available? I coach the baseball team, too.", "Get back to your positions!", "HERE THEY COME! Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags. See to it.", "Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.", "You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?", "You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.", "I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me. ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.", "Scans the Germans with his binoculars. That's a mystery to me.", "Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?", "But we accomplish the mission.", "I don't like that one.", "Except for the last part, that one's not bad.", "Why's that?", "Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.", "Up.  We're moving out. Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.", "We can't leave it here.", "I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.", "Any further thoughts on the subject? But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...", "In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.", "Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army? You have orders, too.", "Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.", "Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.", "Ours is not to reason why.", "Sure, what do you want to know?", "Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?", "Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.", "Well, I, for one, like cheese.", "There's always a bright side.", "There's to be a bright side, look for it.", "Yeah, how so?", "Sure, Reiben.", "Trust me, you're the best.", "Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.", "Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.

I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?", "The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?

Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.", "Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.", "Have you ever been there before?", "Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?", "I promise.", "I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.", "My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.", "You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!", "Did he...? Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?", "I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix. In other words, no.", "Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?", "You too, preacher? Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about \"I don't believe in vampires\" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires!

What're ya gonna say?", "You best better get it done, Pops.", "Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border. Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!", "I can handle Richie, don't worry.", "Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.", "Didn't like it, did ya?", "Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?", "Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.", "I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.", "I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?", "Why'd ya quit?", "Was? As in not anymore?", "You're a preacher?", "I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?", "Is this real?", "Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?", "Died instantly?", "Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?", "How'd she die?", "She's dead?", "Where is the little lady?", "Who's this?", "Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names? Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.", "That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.", "Sorry, I need everybody.", "Come again?", "Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.", "Where are the keys to the motor home? Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!", "It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance.", "Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.", "How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.", "What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags? Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.", "What's your name?", "See ya.", "I'm sorry. You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.", "Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.", "How many bullets left, kid? Anytime.", "Daddy's dead.", "Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!", "Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.", "How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two? In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, \"Digayo.\" When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called \"The Titty Twister.\" From what I hear, you can't miss it.", "Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?", "You must have a bible in here, don't cha?", "You damn well better. Go.", "Do you believe me?", "You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said? The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.", "Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!", "You callin' him a liar?", "He says you were scratching.", "Were you giving that pig signals? I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to \"Benny's World of Blood.\"", "Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.", "I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.", "Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?", "What dya mean?", "Whiskey! Scarred for life, that's how I am!", "Well, then ask her, dumb ass.", "Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us? Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together.", "My shit is together.", "I'm here with you.", "What do you mean?", "How?", "No, Richie, what do I look like?", "That's what you look like.", "That's how you're lookin', Richie.", "It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.", "When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.", "Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.", "They broke when you fell.", "Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?", "We are...  \"South of the border down Mexico way.\"", "Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.", "Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?", "Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.", "I don't know, you just passed out.", "You okay?", "This ain't the time.", "Keep your voice down.", "This ain't the time, Richard.", "Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.", "No, I didn't.", "What?", "As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.", "Duly noted. Now, shut up.", "Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,", "Richard!", "Yes, Seth, I understand.", "Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.", "This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?", "Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?", "Is it me? Is it my fault?", "No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.", "Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you? What the fuck is she doin' there?!", "What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?", "Where's the woman? I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --", "Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.", "I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.", "Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting.

You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.", "That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.", "I'm gonna go get the money.", "I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel?

Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?"], "John_Williams": ["Not yet.", "Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.

Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.", "You're all through with this now?", "Who knows you have these?", "Is Sandy part of this?", "Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?", "Okay?", "Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.", "Jeffrey! Come on in. It's blue. Blue velvet.", "Blue. It's Blue Velvet.", "I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall.

And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.", "I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.", "Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.", "Come into the study a minute. Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.", "By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential.

They're in Alaska by now.", "Kirk. They're gone.", "But Kirk...", "Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?", "It's true... what you said...", "Here... In the park?", "I bet you're a damn good poker player.", "So. There we are.", "Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are...

I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.", "Don't tell me: you're from outer space.", "... Who are you?", "Wanna try it from the top? You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?", "What's that? Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.", "Sorry, the time would have to be right now.", "My whales?

I'da let you off right here.", "It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks.

I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops. Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them...

You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?", "We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.", "No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?", "No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?", "No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.", "What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing? No! That's incidental.", "First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius.

Shall I summarize?", "The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.", "There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.", "Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.", "Did he try to?", "Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?", "Why so briefly?", "How long did you live there?", "A cattle ranch?", "After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.", "Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?", "The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice.

I'm not interested in your worst invention.", "Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be \"turns\" with us, too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things.

I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.", "Was it a butterfly?", "Mmm. And what else...?", "Big through the hips. Roomy.", "Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?", "That is both impudent and untrue...

Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.", "I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.", "Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments. Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.", "Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?", "Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?", "Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.", "Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?", "Ahhh... Why?", "And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?", "Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.", "His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under \"Missing Person\" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.", "I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.", "Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?", "Your bleeding has stopped. Advancement, of course.  Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go.  I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you?", "No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.", "I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me. A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.", "And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.", "You're a tough one, aren't you?", "Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?", "I didn't.", "Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.", "Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.", "All flayed...?", "How many women has he used, our Bill?", "Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?", "No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.", "Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.", "Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?", "I have no doubt of it.", "It's much better than your shoes.", "I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?", "Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  \"Multiple Miggs,\" in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say? Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.", "Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?", "That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you? May I see your credentials?", "\"We\" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.", "Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.", "Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves.

That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.", "Did you breast-feed her?", "I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges.

It's about God's values.", "I know this is the only copy, Paul.

So you've indicated. Do it.", "Then light the match, Paul.", "I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.", "Yes.", "Yes.", "But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said \"I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way.\" I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first.

But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again. No problem.", "Done?", "I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again. I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.  'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too.", "For a while I thought I might go crazy.

You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance. Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.", "Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?", "Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.", "And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.", "You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point.

This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.", "How can you close me up? On what grounds?", "Put it down as a gesture to love.", "Yeah? Why?", "So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.", "Well, it looks like you're a little late.", "Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?", "That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon.

I will.", "-- Hello, Ilsa.", "I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.", "Oh, how do you do?", "Yeah, you were saying? Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.", "Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.", "And got well paid for it on both occasions.", "Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?", "Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.", "He'll take one.", "Why two?", "Okay.", "I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.", "Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.", "-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.", "His escape.", "It'll be interesting to see how he manages.", "Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.", "Victor Laszlo?", "Yeah? What's his name?", "I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.", "Yeah? Have a brandy?", "I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency. Our entertainment is enough.", "I stick my neck out for nobody.", "What, again?", "I was misinformed.", "My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.", "It was a combination of all three.", "Why?

Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.", "Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.", "My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.", "Are my eyes really brown?

Right now.", "This is your plan, Finch?", "I don't get it, that really works?", "Then what the hell are you talking about?", "Did you guys hook up or something?", "No comment?!  Are you kidding me?!

If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.", "I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.", "Of course.", "Well of course I'd want to give her that.

Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.", "How do you know that?", "Hey, minuteman. Holy shit!", "He's going in!", "Come on, Jim.  Where are you?", "No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!", "Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.", "Just in time.", "I'll save you a seat.", "You can send me the address too.", "Went home to shit.", "No -- it's true.

But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!", "That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too. No, a pact.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.

I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.", "What?!  How do I do that?", "Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...", "Ready for what?", "Does it tell me how to get laid?", "What?  Not the Bible?", "Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.", "What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.", "Yeah, but we'll still see each other.", "Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?", "I guess we'll call you two-ply. He didn't?", "I don't care.", "It was a pact.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --", "Attitude?  Me?  I think that you guys should be more enthusiastic.

Chicks are gonna want to do it.", "So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance. Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --", "This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.", "I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong. That's the spirit.", "Feeling better, Oz?

These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.", "I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.", "I'll try to drop by later.", "Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.", "Charisma?", "Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?", "Oh, I couldn't copy your work.", "Well! Nothing like experimenting. I'll see you at school, O.K.?", "I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.", "So that's cool with you, then?", "I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.", "I know.", "When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time. I'm pregnant.", "Go Carole.  So, guess what?", "Your shorts are looking especially gold today.", "Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.", "Hey Bleek.", "It really didn't hurt that bad having him.", "You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?", "Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?", "Wow, dream big!", "We don't even have a dog!", "You don't know anything about me!", "Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.", "I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.", "They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!", "I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.", "The term \"deliver\" is so weird. Can we not say \"deliver\"?", "Cool it.", "No. Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.", "But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend. But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.", "No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.", "I have no idea how to spit this out. I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.", "Shit, yeah. Close it up.", "Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid. Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.", "I'm a junior.", "Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes!", "Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife. Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.", "Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?", "I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.", "But you're old!", "I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!", "This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!", "No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!", "No.", "What?", "I don't know.", "Only squares and nerds go to dances.", "Oh, okay. Like this. Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!", "That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?", "You do?", "What?", "Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.", "\"Most Fruitful Yuki\"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!", "Oh God, you're one of those guys...", "Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!", "Cool.", "Is Vanessa here?", "Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.", "Consider it your musical education.", "Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.", "I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.", "So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.", "You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.", "Why?", "Hey, what kind of swag did you score? I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.", "I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.", "Why? What the big deal?", "I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.", "Uh, thanks.", "My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.", "Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?", "So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?", "This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark. Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.", "Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.", "The Wizard of Gore?", "I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.", "You don't have to do that.", "Hey, I like this.", "I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.", "What is it? Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.", "Yeah?", "You know... it's parts...", "That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.", "The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.", "No, he's the dad.", "I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.", "Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.", "You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?", "Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!", "Oh.", "Like what?", "No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?", "Why aren't you at work?", "Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?", "Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.", "I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?", "That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.", "Your guitar is named Kimber?", "Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.", "When was this, like '96?", "Yeah.", "What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?", "What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.", "I rock a Harmony.", "It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.", "Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.", "Blood and guts.", "You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...", "I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.", "Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.", "Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?", "Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.", "Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds. Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?", "No. Geeeerta Rauuuss!", "Really? Fingernails?", "Well, it was nice seeing you.", "Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, \"Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!\"", "You should try Adderall.", "Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?", "Uh, hi Su-Chin. I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.", "Nothing.", "Elbow.", "Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.", "Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!", "Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.", "Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today? Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.", "What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?", "I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.", "Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying \"Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?\"", "This is the baby. Your baby.", "Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...", "I went to the doctor today.", "Nothing...", "Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?", "I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.", "Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking. Room with a toilet, got it.", "Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.", "Well, you're lucky it's not you.", "Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.", "Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.", "A Maker's Mark, please. Up.", "Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know? Sure.", "Vanessa, right?", "Congrats.", "No thank you. I'm off sex.", "Juno MacGuff.", "Hi. I'm here for the big show? Thundercats are go!", "Either I just pissed my pants or...", "I sort of already have.", "Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.", "Please stop now.", "Dad, no!", "Yeah, like people in love.", "I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.", "I'm losing my faith in humanity.", "Yeah, she does.", "Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.", "Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?", "Hi Dad. Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.", "I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.", "I have no idea what kind of girl I am.", "Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!", "Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.", "No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.", "What? The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.", "I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!", "They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.", "No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.", "Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?", "My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...", "I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.", "Jesus, I didn't say it was.", "Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.", "I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.", "Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.", "I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.", "Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.", "There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.", "Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!", "Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.", "Eww, he's all beardy!", "Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as \"Keith,\" okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.", "Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!", "God, why is everyone always staring at me?", "Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.", "Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.", "I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously. Right, seriously.", "You sound shocked or something.", "That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.", "Hly shht! Share the love, Tits!", "How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters? No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.", "It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.", "Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!", "I'm pregnant.", "Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!", "I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.", "No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as \"wholesome.\" I'm looking for something a little edgier.", "There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.", "The Penny Saver sucks. Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.", "There are ads? For parents?", "Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.", "I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.", "What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.", "I'm staying pregnant, Le.", "I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!", "It was magnificent, man!", "It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.", "Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.", "Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.", "That is sick, man.", "Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.", "I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.", "That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.", "Unfortunately, yes.", "I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.", "It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.", "Dude, I'm pregnant.", "No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?", "I am a suicide risk."], "James_Carter": ["OK. Say what it is.", "Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!", "That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.", "That's some serious poundage in dollars.", "Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?", "Lee!  It's him!", "You know what a phone booth is?! Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my \"still\".", "And that, of course, would be me.", "Feds asked for me?", "Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.", "I know, but --", "Sir, I can explain.", "So was I.", "Tell me about it.", "I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  Your ass is goin' to jail!", "He stole my wheel!", "Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.", "No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?", "FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.", "You know him?", "Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.", "What?", "Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.", "I'm sorry, Lee.", "You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?", "No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it. It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.", "Like that. No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.", "OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.", "This concrete?  This is still America.", "Which one?", "What?! Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.", "No, fish is a PM food.", "I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.", "No! You hate me.  Look, I'm gonna do it one time.  That's it.", "Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.", "No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!", "That's not how it goes.", "You know War?", "Now, that's American music. No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.", "Yeah, it's good.", "Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.", "Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant. It happens.", "You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.", "Let's go.  Everybody take off? Come on!", "Yeah, somethin' like that.  OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand?  OK, let's go.", "What?", "When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?", "Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'? Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?", "Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.", "Don't go there...", "What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?", "Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.", "Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?", "It was my ass that almost got trashed!", "What the hell kinda cop are you?!", "The license!  You get it?!", "You make the plate? You don't know what a shortcut is?", "I know a shortcut.", "Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.", "Right....", "You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole. Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!", "Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.", "Where were we? Well don't do that.  Polite don't work here.  You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.", "That silly-ass look on your face.", "-- what the hell is that? Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.", "Yeah, that's right.  Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.", "Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.", "You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?", "It's the same thing!", "Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.", "You speak English! Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns.  That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.", "You have one of these? Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.", "You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!", "Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.", "Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.", "Not to me. Never to me.", "Yeah. So why you look do down?", "You OK? It's okay. For restaurants.", "That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!", "What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.", "It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?", "Oh my god...what happened to you? Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?", "This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?", "Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.", "Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.", "No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.", "Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.", "In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.", "Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.", "How'd what go? I wouldn't be close to you.  What is that perfume, girl?", "I could get promoted right out of here.", "Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is? FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.", "Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds. Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.", "Oh, baby, you cruel...", "You're killin' me here.", "Not anymore.", "Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?", "What?!", "Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night... No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.", "Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir? Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is.  He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.", "Hmmmm?", "Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!", "Yo, Johnson...", "You understand what I'm sayin'? Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --", "What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?", "Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?", "What kind of assignment is that?", "I'm talking about the girl.", "Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...", "Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.", "How much they want?", "Any demands yet?", "Where do we find him? I'm waitin' here for a name.", "All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.", "You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.", "You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.", "Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?", "What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?", "You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk. Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?", "I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.", "This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.", "You a cop or something?", "Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother..."], "Sandy_Williams": ["Look Jeffrey.", "No Jeffrey!!", "Go ahead!", "Go ahead.", "Jeffrey? What's going on? Right. Watch out for Mike, there.", "Probably not. No. Why?", "Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?", "Dorothy Vallens?", "No.", "Oh my God. What's wrong? Okay.", "Just a minute.", "NO.", "Really?", "You want to dance?", "Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?", "It's okay.", "Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?", "It's good to see you.", "What was that all about?", "What is it?", "I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!", "You didn't tell him about me?", "Everything okay?", "Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.", "Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.", "You like mysteries that much?", "Jeffrey? Why?", "I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this.

They seem to like each other.", "Shoot.", "You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals. Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.", "What am I going to do?", "You were late.", "Goodnight.", "You better not, Jeffrey.", "Okay, be careful.", "No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.", "So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.", "I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.", "You're sure right. It is a strange world.", "Who, me? Why should it?", "Yeah?", "Did you see her undressed?", "Twice. Without her sensing anything?", "You saw a lot in one night.", "Wow. Should you tell my father?", "You want to tell me about it?", "You want a Dairy Queen? It's okay. Don't worry about it.", "He got a little jealous.", "What did you see?", "Well, how did it go? What happened? Okay, okay. Bye.", "I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.", "I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?", "I'm going to wait here until she comes.", "Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?", "Okay, yeah, call.", "I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.", "I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.", "OK.", "Yeah, but.", "It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.", "Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it. I'll drink to that.", "That sounds good. This is not my usual Friday night!", "Brilliant.", "What's the plan.", "Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.", "I already know. The \"Slow Club\". It's on Route 7.", "I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?", "You really want to do this, don't you?", "Yes. I do.", "I owe you, since I goofed up this one.", "So, what's next?", "Yeah, if it opens the door.", "No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.", "I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?", "Are you alright? Alright. Good luck, yourself.", "Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.", "Alright.", "You've got a point there.", "I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.", "What will I say when she comes to the door?", "Now, how are you going to do that?", "It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.", "You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.", "Alright, now tell me. What is it? Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.", "I'm here, aren't I?", "Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.", "I don't know.", "I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.", "I've gotta go in.", "What happened to him?", "Still, it must be kinda rough.", "Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?", "My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.", "I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.", "I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.", "That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching. Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.", "Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.", "Maybe so.", "No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.", "There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.", "I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.", "Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? ", "That's too bad.", "Yeah. What are you doing now?", "Terrible boring.", "Yes.", "Am I bothering you?", "You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?", "I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.", "Stop it Mike.", "Okay.", "Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.", "Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.", "You can change it if you want to.", "Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you."], "Batman": ["... Murderer...", "What are you talking about?", "Take me. Let the boy go.", "I had to save you, Vicki.

Move out.", "There is no such regulation.", "We're finding it.  Please, please -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...", "HURRY.", "Khan!", "This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert. Take the test again.", "We learn by doing, Lieutenant.", "That was a little joke. You may ask, Lieutenant.", "There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.", "You're bothered by your performance on the Kobayashi Maru.", "You earned it.", "Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.", "Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently? Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.", "How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?", "A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face.

Just great. Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.", "No reply, Chekov... Continue on course...", "Calm yourself, Bones.", "Unit two, this is One.

I'll be in my quarters.", "Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?", "Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?", "My God...", "And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?", "But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!", "What? What are you saying?", "Goodbye, David.", "Is there anything we can do?!", "What happened...?", "This Vulcan -- is he alive?", "Saavik... Is... David with you?", "You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!", "Yes, yes, Spock... Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.", "You would have done the same for me.", "Yes.

David!", "Who is this?! How dare you --", "Torpedoes coming in -- !", "I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!

What if he melded with someone else?!", "Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!", "But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!", "... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.", "...

I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!", "But -- why?", "Yes, I was...", "I -- saw no future --", "Then you know how bravely your son met his death.", "Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...", "Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...", "Not me, Bones... They did it.", "Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...", "Come on, Pavel...", "An experimental device, doctor.", "What did you say she was getting? What do you think, Spock?", "Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.", "Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.", "If you have a better idea - now's the time.", "-- That's the general idea.", "Would you prefer to do nothing?", "We've done it before.", "Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.", "Bones, stay here.", "Bones -- Mr. Sulu... Take us home...", "It'll come back to him.", "What do you mean?", "We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.", "Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!", "Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:", "Understood. What is your plan?", "Ah, well done, team 2. Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.", "No choice now, Scotty! May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!", "Shields, Mr. Chekov. That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?", "Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.", "I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.", "Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?", "You mean this is -- goodbye?", "Hey! -- Where you going?! ... You have a point...", "He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.", "Mr. Sulu: full power descent!", "You tricked me. Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.", "I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The frequency.", "You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.", "All I need is the radio frequency to track them.", "Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now? Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!", "A spaceship with a missing man.", "... Damn!", "... Gone?!", "We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...", "It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.", "Steady, now. We need your help. Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...", "Right.", "Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.", "Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.", "It wouldn't be my first choice, no.", "You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?", "Noon tomorrow...?!", "Then tell me when the whales are leaving.", "You want the details?", "That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.", "All right. The truth?", "No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.", "Who do you think I am?", "Tell me when the whales are going to be released?", "What's what?", "What do you mean now?", "It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.", "Hm?", "If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?", "You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.", "Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?", "How will that be done, exactly?", "You're upset about losing the whales.", "So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?", "Implicitly.", "It's his way.", "Just a little joke. See you later, old friend. Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.", "In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.", "We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.", "No, ma'am. No dipshit.", "What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.", "What's going to happen when you release the whales?", "Can I ask you something?", "Iowa.", "Memory problems, too.", "Thanks.", "We don't want to be any trouble.", "He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.", "There's really very little point in my trying to explain.", "Back to San Francisco.", "I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...", "How soon?", "Why's that?", "It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...", "You mean man...", "You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we sink.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.", "Spock: Condition report! Then... Where the hell are we?", "Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?", "Can we make breakaway speed!? You?  Spock, that's extraordinary.", "Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?", "Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me? Right.  Will you help us?", "Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?", "Thank you, Spock.", "Our mission! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about that!!", "Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!", "That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?", "Status? He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.", "It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving. ... I see.", "They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?", "What else did you learn from your mind meld?", "You've done it before. Can't you remember?", "You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.", "And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.", "Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.", "About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.", "Spock...", "Come on, fellah -- speak up!", "Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....", "You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.", "Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?", "Yes.", "... Simple logic.", "I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.", "Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem? And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?", "Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.", "But you said toxic.", "Explain.", "Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!", "Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit. Well done, Mr. Spock.", "Earth... But when?... Spock?", "You've programmed that from memory...?", "What are the variables...?", "Surely you can be more specific...", "What is our target in time?", "Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.", "Mr. Spock, your computations?", "But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?", "That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.", "Is there any other planet where this species exists?", "Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated? Whales?", "Spock...?", "Where are you going?! Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?", "Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man? Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.", "Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?", "Permission granted.", "Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu. Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --", "Picture, Uhura!", "Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...", "Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.", "Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!", "Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.", "Go, Mr. Sulu.", "We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.", "Picture, please.", "What is our condition?", "Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?! Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!", "Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!", "Steady as she goes...", "Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?", "Weapons systems?", "Out of control, and blind as a bat!", "Mr. Scott -- how soon?", "Estimate range, ship to whales! On screen.", "Put them on screen!", "Bearing!", "Uhura!... Where!", "Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him...", "Any luck...? Everyone remember where we parked.", "We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales? Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.", "From a city? That doesn't make sense....", "On speakers.", "Then, this is what it would sound like underwater? On screen!", "What is it? Mr. Sulu?", "Systems report.  Communications? Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.", "Go on ahead... Close the hatch!", "The explosive override -- ?", "The whales...?! On my way...!", "Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future... Mr. Sulu, if you please.", "Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -", "Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.", "Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?", "How long, Scotty?", "Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure? Mr. Sulu?", "Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!", "Oh I see --  Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.", "What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --", "I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?", "Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.", "It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.", "You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.", "Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.", "Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.", "That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?", "Scotty, how long is this bay? Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.", "Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?", "Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye. You will be in good hands here.", "Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?", "Thank you, Lt. Saavik.", "We will answer and present proof of our answer when it is ready!", "Our data is being prepared.", "Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices. The information will not be disclosed.", "Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.", "Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.", "The carbon-units are not responsible for that.", "Why?!", "Why...?!", "The examination is a normal function.", "Who is V'ger?", "Find the Creator? What Creator? Whose...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?", "Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?", "Where is Lt. Ilia? Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?", "Who is...'V'ger'...?", "Mr. Scott... on my next signal.", "Engineering...", "Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate? Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!", "Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!", "Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.", "Departure angle on viewer. Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!", "Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...", "Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately. No!", "    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two seconds; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.", "Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called. The question is, Mr. Decker, is there a next move...", "They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.", "Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!", "It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...", "Computer off!", "How do you define unwarranted, mister?!", "That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.", "Mr Decker....", "No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?", "Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.", "If our Executive Officer has no objections...?", "I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?", "Granted.", "Stop competing with me, Decker!", "You saved the ship.", "Then you acted properly, of course.", "Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded? Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.", "Programming ready? You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.", "We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...", "That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.", "My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...", "Yes.", "You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander. I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.", "I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.", "Viewer, standard ahead.", "Opinion, Mister. Spock?", "Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!", "Mr. Spock? I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...", "Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!", "Time to impact...?", "And in you, too, Lieutenant. Our Exec and Science Officer...", "Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.", "That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.", "Hold station...!", "Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us not to look them over now!", "Viewer ahead. Hold relative position here...", "Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.", "Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.", "Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.", "Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.", "Hold station.", "Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.", "I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker? Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!", "Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'", "Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...", "See that it is.  Take me over, please.", "Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?", "... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?", "Spock, we were its answer!", "There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...", "V'ger plans to literally meld to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...", "The point... ", "There is no alternative.", "Not for us?", "The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?", "Child...!? High mag, Mr. Sulu!", "What answers?", "What should you have known?", "Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?", "If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?", "Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...", "And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.", "Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your personal one?", "Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!", "Spock? Concerned about his chances? Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.", "They had a pattern to follow...", "Have you been able to analyze any of this...? Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!", "Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!", "Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.", "No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude... Mr. Decker... ?", "But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.", "Our... 'insignificance'?", "Any reply from them?", "Communicated with us how?", "Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...", "Do not return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility! I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.", "Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an immediate report on anything further you learn or sense from here on.", "And whatever you sensed out here....", "Also -- there was nothing in your report about why you're here.", "You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth? I want him here.  Sit down!", "Sit down, please.", "I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!", "Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.", "Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...", "Why aren't you on board?", "You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer? Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.", "Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?", "That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!", "Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott. Engineer, we need Warp speed now!", "Yes, well, congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.", "But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than... I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.", "Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry. Thanks for pointing that out.", "Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.", "You left spacedock without a tractor beam?", "No, no. Thank you.", "Oh, of course.", "Well, may we have a look around? It's our pleasure.", "Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.", "Did we do it? Did we make a difference?", "Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that.", "I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?", "How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?", "Close to retirement?", "Captain of the Enterprise, huh? She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.", "This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.", "No, no, it's not. It's better. I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one  I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.", "You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history? Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you.  Something's missing.", "So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?", "This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.", "Beautiful day, isn't it?", "Kirk here.", "Keep her together until I get back. Where are the deflector relays?", "Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.", "A photon torpedo?", "I thought you might.", "The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty? Phasing? To where?", "Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?", "You know, Scotty, it amazes me. When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.", "I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.", "Oh", "To be -", "Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it. Come on...", "Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...", "She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...", "Spock's looking for us...", "Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.", "It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship. No way.  You see this?", "Don't remind me.", "Still think we're finished?", "Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.", "No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.", "Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.", "I didn't mean this future.", "Bones, are you afraid of the future?", "We're not finished.", "Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge. We've been set up all along.", "Thanks...", "No!", "Can you - ?", "I wish I knew. Uhura?", "You heard the order, Lieutenant.", "As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.", "I am.", "I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.", "Well, I -", "I have on occasion disobeyed orders.", "Yes.", "Those words WERE spoken by me.", "Yes...", "Yes.", "That isn't true...!", "That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -", "I checked the data banks, yes.", "There... were no other ships in the sector.", "The drink WAS served...", "What?", "He just tried to save him!", "He's a DOCTOR!", "WHAT HAPPENED?", "My God, what happened here? I beg your pardon?", "Would you care to go topside? I'm not sure how to take that.", "Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...", "Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.", "Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...", "Shields. Battle stations. Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...", "She's here - somewhere. She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.", "Who else?", "First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.", "Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?", "Uhura, monitor!", "I know what you mean...", "Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...", "Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?", "We must do this again soon.", "Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...", "Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...", "We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.", "Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?", "Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.", "Not me, idiot - HIM!", "What took you so long?", "Isn't it about time you became something else?", "Your friends are late...", "An accident wasn't good enough...", "I've heard of chameloids - \"Shapeshifters\" - I thought you were mythical. Candidate for what?", "Possibly.", "Where do we come in?", "Except us.", "There's gotta be a way out of this place...", "Anything else you want to tell me?", "How much time's left of your sentence?", "We didn't kill Gorkon.", "How did you know...?", "Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.", "He's got it.", "WHO ELSE...?", "Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.", "Stand down your weapons. Energize...", "You hear that?", "Starfleet will be around long enough for me to convene a Court Martial on this ship, Lieutenant. Win, lose or draw it will be on your record.", "Who is \"US?\" Uhura, signal our surrender.", "Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?", "Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?", "I hope you're happy.", "Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside... Only don't try putting words in my mouth.", "You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -", "Right -", "Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -", "I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.", "Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.", "Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...", "As you were. Lieutenant...?", "Thank you, Captain Sulu.", "When does this conference start?", "I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...", "I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.", "Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.", "You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.", "Sulu!", "The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy... Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened of change. I know I was.", "But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - \"the undiscovered country\"...", "What's she waiting for? Make ourselves a target?", "Close enough to beam down? Spock, you want to know something?", "Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -", "Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter \"S.\" You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -", "Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...", "You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.", "I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust. The night is young. Anyway, it was logical.  You know, you're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for  rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us.", "Are you dining on worms?", "Why would they give them to us?", "What peace conference?", "So, that's it..", "He was just about to explain the whole damn -", "I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.", "We HAVEN'T fired -", "What the - From Enterprise?", "Where?", "Spock, I'm really tired...", "What is it? I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.", "Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -", "Never been this close. Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...", "LET THEM DIE.", "DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -", "I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.", "How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -", "WE volunteered? You have personally -", "Me? Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.", "Uhura? Who else?", "I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.", "WE SURRENDER.", "This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.", "Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.", "Understood. Kirk out.", "Have the Klingons responded?", "Oh, please.", "With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.", "On \"The Planet Of Galactic Peace?\"", "You caught me on my way to the shower.", "Bob?", "Can we have it quiet?", "Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!", "Mr. Scott, you're amazing.", "Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft? If we could send a distress signal...", "Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.", "I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.", "Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.", "You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened? Go, Sulu.", "Transporter room. Status.", "Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.", "Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu. Put it on the screen.", "Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?", "Why didn't you beep my communicator?", "Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.", "Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?", "Spock, I thought I was going to die.", "Spock?", "What is this?", "Spock... don't. Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.", "To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.", "Spock. Fire the rockets!", "Spock... the booster rockets. It must be all those marsh melons.", "Hmmm?", "The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.", "New word. \"b\".. \"a\"... um... \"a\"... \"n\"...uh, \"d\"... end of word.", "You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an \"s.\" That's a little vague, Spock -", "Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.", "But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.", "Is what possible?", "This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?", "How do you know?", "There's got to be a way out of this place. He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...", "Why didn't you tell me this before?", "I gotta sit down.", "There, you see? See?", "You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.", "You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!", "Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...", "I ordered you to defend this ship.", "You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.", "Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!", "What you have done is betray every man on this ship.", "Damnit, Spock. God damnit! Let me do something.", "An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.", "Be one with the horse.", "Spock. We don't have 1.2 hours.", "Mr. Sulu. Execute.", "That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.", "Damn.  Let's go.", "Fascinating.", "Why?", "What do you mean?", "Who is it he reminds you of?", "But he does seem familiar?", "Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?", "What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost. General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.", "Not General Korrd.", "I could use a shower.", "Goodnight, Spock. Goodnight, Bones.", "Go to sleep, Spock.", "Yes, Spock?", "Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.", "Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in? The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, \"Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream..\" The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please.", "\"Row, row, row your boat...\" I love \"Row...\"  Do - do you know \"Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?\"", "\"Pack Up Your Troubles.\" That's great.

See you Friday night, if not before.", "Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.", "You worry about me really? Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.", "I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.", "Yeah.", "Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.", "Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.", "Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.", "Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?", "That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?", "You want to go talk to him?", "I'm really sorry.", "See ya tomorrow.", "Okay, okay.", "Can I give you a kiss good night? Okay, Sandy.", "I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?", "I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.", "Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.", "Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?", "That's what I thought.", "That doesn't bother you, does it?", "Yeah. I mean a little, you know.", "Yes.", "Actually. I've been in twice.", "I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.", "OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the \"yellow man\". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.", "No way. I'm about to blow up.", "I'm sorry, I didn't...", "What's with Mike? Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?", "Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.", "That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?", "Okay, thanks.", "Are you sure?", "Yeah.", "Look, it can wait till Sunday.", "Oh, okay, can I call?", "I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.", "Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.", "Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?", "It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?", "Why not?", "Here's to. An interesting experience. Two.", "Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.", "First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.", "Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.", "Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?", "First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.", "I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.", "Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.", "You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?", "Pretty clever. Are you game for more?", "Yeah.", "I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?", "Yes and no. Did you recognize him?", "Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?", "Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.", "Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name? Let's go.", "Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?", "Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.", "You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few \"Awake\" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?", "Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.", "Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.", "Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?", "There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.", "I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.", "I don't want to cause any trouble.", "I'd like to talk to you about something.", "You hungry or thirsty, or both? Yeah. Good bye.", "I guess I'll see you sometime. Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.", "I don't know. He moved away.", "It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.", "I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.", "You really do hear a lot, don't you?", "Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?", "Did they find out anything when they questioned her?", "Where are they?", "I guess you have to get back home soon?", "It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?", "The ear is from a missing person maybe?", "Were all these people questioned this afternoon?", "Do you know who was brought in for questioning?", "Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?", "What do you know about the ear? Anything?", "I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.", "What else is new? Right?", "How is Central these days?", "No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?", "Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.", "Oh yeah?", "Yeah, how did you know?"], "David_Della_Rocco": ["You gotta keep going.", "You guys? You won't do it Connor, you won't.

I told you I never saw him before!", "C'mon!", "You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit. Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here.

That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.", "No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?", "You think they sold me out? No way.", "What are you saying?", "What?", "She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.", "Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.", "Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.", "Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?", "Anybody you think is evil?", "What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!", "What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!", "Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.

Perseverance.", "Oh?", "Do you have a romantic bone in your body?", "That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.

Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.", "Thank you.", "Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.", "Yes...", "That'll be all.", "All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.

Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could? Sir --", "No, sir --", "And roosters.", "Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.

He's still alive, but won't be for long. Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created.

He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.", "You gotta idea, spit it out.", "Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.", "We can't take him to a hospital.", "He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.", "So what is it?", "So, is he dead or what?", "I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon? Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?", "Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.", "Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.", "So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.", "No shit?", "What?", "Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.", "No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.", "I got 'em, all right?", "I got the diamonds.", "Nope.", "Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?", "What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.", "At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.", "Did ya see what happened to anybody else?", "I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.", "I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.", "Could you believe Mr. Blonde?", "No real people?", "Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody? Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.", "Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.", "I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?", "The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.", "That's not correct.", "Why not?", "I'm cool.", "What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said \"No thank you\", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!", "Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.", "You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?", "This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.", "Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?", "Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?", "Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?", "Fuck all that.", "So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em.

You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled.", "Shall we play, doctor?", "If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.", "You know, you should come by STARK TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land.", "Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises. Nothing?", "You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?", "Funny things are.", "You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut.", "You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.", "He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets. It's bugging him too, isn't it?", "That's just the prototype. I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.", "I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.", "Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide.  Blueberry?", "An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not possible.", "Following is not really my style.", "Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use?", "That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.", "What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit. It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does.", "Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.", "You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege.", "Because I learned how.", "Hey, I've read all about your accident.", "I guess we'll find out.", "You just might.", "Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you.", "And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss.  What is PHASE 2? Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed.", "I'm sorry, Nick. What were you lying?", "Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always calms everything right down.", "Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?", "Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.", "Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.", "I think I would just cut the wire.", "A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle!", "Got it.", "I can get there faster.", "You gonna stop me?", "I'm not afraid to hit an old man.", "Yep!", "I'm on it!", "Find engine three. I'll meet you there.", "Good. See what we got. I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris.", "Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push.", "Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag...", "See that red lever? It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it, wait for my word.", "Cap, I need the lever!", "Lever. Now!", "No. There was a uh...cellist, I think.", "He was an idiot.", "For taking on Loki alone.", "He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have...", "Right. How did that work for him?", "WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching to Fury's fife!", "He made it personal.", "That is the point. That's Loki's point. He hit us all right where we live. Why?", "He had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?", "Yeah.", "Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.", "Skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock.", "Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten you.", "Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage. You've got the blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink?", "No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You sure? I'm having one.", "Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one. But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them.", "Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you.", "We have a HULK.", "You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.", "Well, performance issues. You know? Jarvis. Anytime now.", "Right. Army.", "Fine. Let's keep them occupied.", "I'm seeing, still working on believing. Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?", "Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a soft spot.", "Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.", "Nice call. What else you got?", "And he didn't invite me?", "I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute.", "Save the rest for return, J.", "What the hell? What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me?", "Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.", "And then shawarma after.", "We create our own demons. Who said that? What does that even mean? Doesn't matter, I said it cause he said it. So now he was famous and that's basically get said by two well known guys. I don't, uh...I'm gonna start again. Let's track this from the beginning.", "Hey, do you want...?", "I gave a speech? How was it?", "Really?", "It's my favorite kind, a winning combo.", "Uh...to town on each other, probably back in your room. Cause I also wanna see your research.", "Oh, I finally met a man called Ho. Come here.", "Oh, this guy.", "Hey. You're a heart doctor. She's going to need a cardiologist, FIA.", "It started in Berns, Switzerland, 1999, the old days. I never thought they'd come back to bite me. Why would they?", "Who isn't? She needs me.", "Oh, wow. He made it. He made the cut.", "Uh...she'll take both. One to throw away and one to not call.", "I see that, cause it's on your t-shirt.", "Ladies, follow the mullet.", "I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.", "Yeah, cheese clown. I'm going to ditch these clowns; I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes. I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real quick. You know what I'm talkin' about?", "Damn betcha. Come on! I thought that was just a theory.", "Wow.", "That's incredible. Essentially you're hacking into the genetic operating system...", "...of an organism.", "Wow.", "She's not like the others.", "Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.", "Happy, leave her ficus alone.", "So you're starting with plants?", "Human application.", "It's revolutionary.", "It can change the world.", "You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.", "Uh...in Switzerland.", "You're sweet.", "You almost bought it, didn't you?", "Have you checked the telomerized algorithm?", "We're good.", "You're...you're right on me. I made it.", "Look, she was just talking about glitches happening.", "Hey!", "Happy New Year.", "Alright, I'll see you in the mornin'.", "Yep.", "Okay. So why am I telling you this? Because I had just created demons, and I didn't even know it. Yeah, those were the good times. Then I moved on. After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene. Forgot that night in Switzerland. These days I'm a changed man, I'm different now. I'm well... you know who I am.", "No. Forty-eight. Ah! Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.", "Which I will. Right, let's do this. Dummy. Hi, Dummy. How did you get that cap on your head? You earned it. Hey. Hey! What are you doing round in the corner? You know what you did. Blood on my mat, handle it.", "Focus up, ladies. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suit. I'm pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass, baby brother. Start tight and go wide, stamp in time. Mark 42 autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test. Initialize sequence. Jarvis, drop my needle. Crap. Alright, I think we got this. Send 'em all. Probably a little fast, slow it down. Slow it down just a... ...little bit. Cool it, will you, Jarvis? Come on. I ain't scared of you. I'm the best.", "And I guess seventy-two hours isn't a long time between siesta's. Didn't think it could get any worse. Then I had to go and turn on the TV. That's when he happened.", "I am Iron Patriot...", "So what's really goin' on? With Mandarin. Seriously, can we talk about this guy?", "Nine.", "You know I can help, just ask. I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile, I got a...I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air.", "Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did?", "You're gonna come at me like that?", "If Richard doesn't mind. You alright with this, Dick?", "I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way.", "It's superhero business, I get it.", "That's why I said I...got it.", "I broke the crayon.", "What'd he say? !", "Sorry. Have to check on the suit...make sure...okay. Check the heart, check the...check the...is it the brain?", "Okay, so I was poisoned?", "Me?", "Sorry, I gotta split.", "Is this forehead of Security?", "What? Harassing interns?", "What's going on? Fill me in.", "Yeah.", "Right.", "Oh, Yeah, yeah. You're the best.", "Um...Switzerland.", "Killian? No, I don't remember that guy.", "His what?", "Look at what? You watching them? Flip the screen and then we can get started.", "Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing.", "Relax.", "I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter. Tell him to go out for a drink or something?", "A giant brain?", "I miss you, Happy.", "Hey, I...I'd hate to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?", "I think there's a gal in HR who's trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her.", "Uh...yeah. Something like that. You know everybody needs a hobby.", "Just breakin' it in. You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so. Oh hey, did you see your Christmas present?", "Well actually, uh...it's a good question. I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow, they're gonna blow out that wall.", "So, uh...tense? Good day? Ooh shoulders, a little naughty. Naughty girl. I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?", "Nailed it, right?", "Huh. Yup, dammit. No can do. You wanna just kiss it on the...", "The facial slit?", "Crowbar. Yeah. Oh, except there's been a...uh...a radiation leak.", "That's risky. At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit or a Geiger counter or something like that. Busted.", "Sorry.", "He was just...", "Well, yeah. I just mean we were just...just hosting you while I finished up a little work.", "And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know if you were comin' home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.", "What?", "Happy was concerned.", "I wasn't...", "Hold on. Come on. Pep. Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry. I'm a piping hot mess. It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything. Nothing's been the same since New York.", "You experience things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky. But, honey, I can't sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker. But threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without.", "But they're part of me.", "Maybe.", "Okay.", "Better.", "Power down! I must have called it in my sleep. Don't go, alright? Pepper?", "Hi.", "Uh...mind leaving that on?", "Sunday night's PBS 'Downtown Abbey'.", "Is that what you want? Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn't know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward, so I've decided that you just died, pal. I'm gonna come get the body. There's no politics here; it's just good old-fashioned revenge. There's no Pentagon; it's just you and me.", "Okay, what do we got here? His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning \"adviser to the King\". South American insurgency tactics, talks like a Baptist preacher. There's lots of pageantry going on here...lots of theater.", "No bomb parts found in a three mile radius of the Chinese theater.", "Talk to me, Happy. Any military victims?", "Bring up the thermogenic signatures again, factor in three thousand degrees.", "Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack. That. You sure that's not one of his?", "Bring it around.", "That's two military guys. Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?", "Are we still at \"ding-dong\"? We're supposed to be on total security lock down. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?", "Right there's fine. You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?", "Don't take it personally, I don't remember what I had for breakfast.", "That's right.", "Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship. It's...with her.", "Yeah, it's Maya Hansen. Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely. Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met.", "What...what for? Why now?", "I'll be fine.", "We weren't.", "She's not really.", "Yep.", "It was a great night.", "What?", "Okay, we've been through this. Nope.", "The man says no.", "Honey...", "I'm sorry.", "I can't protect you out there. I challenged...", "Yes, this is normal!", "It's a big bunny, relax about it!", "I got this for you.", "You still haven't even told me that you liked it!", "I asked you three... You don't like it? !", "I said no.", "What?", "I got you first. Like I said, we can't stay here.", "Jarvis, where's my flight power? !", "That's one.", "That's two.", "Alright, kill the alarm. I got it.", "It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?", "Why?! Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away, I gotta get Pepper, I gotta...", "Who asked you? Open the suit.", "Open eject. Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit.", "Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy.", "Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way.", "You got me. Nice potato gun. Barrel's a little long. Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS.", "It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've got a box of them right here.", "Technically, I am.", "A valid point.", "Life. I built him, I take care of him, I'll fix him.", "Yeah.", "It's Iron Patriot now.", "No, it's not.", "Retroreflective panels?", "You want a stealth mode?", "That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.", "Not a good idea! What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger? He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone.", "Are you? Don't worry about it, I'll fix it. So, uh, who's home?", "Mm. Which happens, dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it. Here's what I need", "Salvation. What's his name?", "The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?", "I got just the thing. Deal? Deal? What'd you say?", "Deal? What's you're name?", "The mechanic.", "The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do. By the way, when you said your sister had a watch, I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that.", "Maybe never, relax about it.", "I don't know, later. Hey kid, give me a little space. What's the official story here? What happened?", "Six people died, right?", "Including Chad Davis?", "Yeah.", "Do you buy that?", "No idea. I'm not...I don't care.", "That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.", "Maybe. Can you stop? Remember when I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?", "Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?", "Nope.", "Probably.", "I don't think so.", "Remember when I said to stop doing that? I swear to God, you're going to freak me out! Ah man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?", "Your fault, you spazzed me out. Okay, back to business. Where were we? The guy who died...relatives? Mom?", "See, now you're being helpful.", "Nice haircut, suits you.", "Yeah, limited edition.", "Mrs. Davis, mind if I join you?", "It sure is.", "I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss. I want to know what you think happened.", "Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Yeah? Supposed to meet somebody here?", "Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill himself, I guarantee you. He didn't kill anyone. Someone used him.", "As a weapon.", "Hey hot wings, you wanna party? You and me, let's go. Crazy, huh?", "Watch this.", "Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography.", "Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding.", "No, I'm not.", "Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?", "Okay, and then you're like, \"Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?\" \"Oh!", "Yes.", "Right!", "Morgan! Morgan.", "Expecting.", "Yes?", "I had a dream about it. It was so real.", "I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles.", "No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-", "I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future usses, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know...", "You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.", "Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna\u00a0have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right?", "I will.", "I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?", "And who's \"we\"?", "Bruce.", "You okay?", "Tell me his name again.", "This is it... What's our timeline?", "Did you seriously just say \"hitherto undreamt of\"?", "Is that what this is...? I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?", "And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...", "It's not bad.", "Whatever. Point is", "And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.", "What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?", "Yeah, that's the... thing.", "Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.", "I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.", "Probably Steve Rogers.", "Maybe. But...", "It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?", "The Avengers broke up. We're toast.", "Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.", "Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?", "You okay? Help him! Wong, Doc.", "F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?", "Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!", "F.R.I.D.A.Y.,\u00a0evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.", "I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here.", "It means get lost, Squidward!", "Banner, you want a piece?", "That's right. Been a while. Good to have you, buddy.", "Where's your guy?", "There's no time for a thing.", "That's the thing right there. Let's go. Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.", "It's okay. Hey, stand down. Keep an eye on him. Thank you.", "It's nano-tech. You like it? A little somet-", "Gotta get that stone outta here, now.", "Exactly. Bye.", "Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?", "Hammer.", "Kid, where'd you come from?", "He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.", "Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.", "Hang on, kid. Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.", "You're too high up. You're running out of air.", "Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home.", "Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8", "Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while.", "Yeah.", "Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.", "Pep\u2026", "Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?", "What the-", "You should not be here.", "I don't wanna hear it.", "And now I gotta hear it.", "What did you just say?", "Yeah. Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.", "You could not have possibly thought this through.", "See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.", "I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.", "Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.", "Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.", "And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening.", "Who just saved your magical ass? Me.", "Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.", "And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.", "No. You're a stowaway. The adults are talking.", "This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.", "Yeah?", "Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking...I'm not so sure we should.", "No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back!", "Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight.", "I don't think this rig has a self-park function. Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?", "This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.", "That was close. I owe you one.", "I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?", "Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?", "Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go!", "You're from Earth?", "Yeah, that's on EARTH, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?", "You know Thor! ?", "Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet. Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?", "Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.", "Alright, just get over here, please.", "We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude...", "What dance-off?", "Don't encourage this, alright?", "We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.", "Your math is blowing my mind.", "Strange! We alright? You're back. You're alright.", "How many did we win?", "Piece of cake, Quill.", "Is he under? Don't let up.", "Parker, help! Get over here. She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.", "Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand? Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!", "Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!", "You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna to lose it.", "You know me?", "My only curse is you.", "Don't..!", "Why would you do that?", "Steady, Quill.", "You're all right.", "That's how I wished it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to\u2026 clear traumatic memories. Huh. It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport\u2026 or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but\u2026  Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in the right mind would've ever funded it. Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement? \"To generate, disseminate\u2026 and preserve knowledge. Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were.

No strings, no taxes\u2026 just reframe the future! Starting now. Go break some eggs.", "Restroom's this way, yeah?", "It's\u2026 fine. I'll be right back.", "Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience.", "Are you going up?", "Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.", "Boy, you know me so well. Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache. That's what's going on, Cap. It's just pain. It's discomfort. Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang? Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass. There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys.", "Who said we're giving up?", "That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing.", "If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later.", "Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?", "No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed - I win.", "No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.", "Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir.", "Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.", "Warmer than jail.", "Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely. FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.", "See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to\u2026 What do you call it?", "We're kinda\u2026 Well, not kinda\u2026", "No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.", "A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA\u2026 and then Ultron. My fault.", "Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you.", "I know, because you're a very polite person.", "No, you don't.", "Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit.", "Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated\u2026", "She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently.", "What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.", "She's not a US citizen.", "And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.", "GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done\u2026 to stave off something worse.", "FRIDAY, get me the source of that outage.", "Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I'm an active-duty non-combatant.", "We will.", "All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullets, Ross.

Call me old fashioned.", "You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?", "Banner and I were doing research.", "That would end the team. Isn't that the mission?

Was she ever not working for you?", "Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?", "You're not the director of me.", "And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.

I found him.", "Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.", "No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing. We're out of my field here.

He always does.", "Who said I was wise?", "It will come. In time. If it's any consolation, I think you're right. About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, everything.

Next time with an army?", "But there's nothing we can do without defying Father.", "It's madness!", "Nothing!", "What?", "Yes, of course! I won't let my brother march into Jotunheim alone. I will be at his side.", "Keep your weapons sheathed and your mouths closed. This is going to take subtlety and sincerity, not brute strength. Leave it to me.", "I'm sorry?", "You must be mistaken.

He's dangerous. You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King?", "Am I cursed?", "What am I?", "What more than that?", "Laufey's son", "You took me for a purpose, what was it?", "So I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me.", "You could have told me what I was from the beginning. Why didn't you?", "Because I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?", "It all makes sense now. Why you favored Thor all these years.", "Because no matter how much you claim to \"love\" me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the Throne of Asgard!", "Guards!", "So why did he lie?", "How long will it last?", "I never get used to seeing him like this. The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored.", "What hope is there for Thor?", "My friends... you haven't heard?

Our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times.", "I had to see you.", "Father is dead.", "Your banishment, the threat of a new war, it was too much for him to bear.

Then I, the bastard son, will have accomplished what Odin and Thor never could.", "No. Asgard is mine. The rest of the Nine Realms will be yours, if you do as you're told.", "What troubles you, Gatekeeper?", "Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.", "You have great power, Heimdall. Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?", "Or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see. Loki sizes him up, smiles.", "Exactly. Just as you're sworn to obey me now. Yes? A beat.", "Good. Then you will open the Bifrost to no one until I have undone what my brother has started.", "You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm? There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am King.", "Ensure my brother does not return.", "Father. Welcome to Asgard.", "And your death came by the son of Odin.", "Found its way back to you, did it?", "It must have been enforcing Father's last command..", "It's good to have you back.

The tribes lived in constant war with each other until a warrior shaman received a vision from the Panther Goddess Bast, who led him to the Heart-Shaped Herb, a plant that granted him superhuman strength, speed and instincts. The warrior became king and the first Black Panther, the protector of Wakanda. Four tribes agreed to live under the king's rule, but the Jabari Tribe isolated themselves in the mountains. The Wakandans used vibranium to develop technology more advanced than any other nation. But as Wakanda thrived, the world around it descended further into chaos.

Magic with a-", "It's coming! It's coming! It's coming! I got it! I got it...!", "Mister Stark? I don't feel so good...", "New York. Queens. It\u2019s a rough borough, but hey, it\u2019s home.", "No one. Just making a little video of the trip.", "Yeah, I know.", "Uh... Because it\u2019s fun.", "So, uh, why do they call you Happy?", "Hey, should I go to the bathroom before?", "Whoa. No pilot? That\u2019s awesome.", "Yeah.", "My first time on any plane. Should it...? Should it be...? Should it be making that noise? Shh. No one has actually told me why I\u2019m in Berlin or what I\u2019m doing. Something about Captain America going crazy.", "Oh, we\u2019re neighbors?", "Okay, Peter, you got this. You got this.", "It\u2019s my suit.", "What case? That\u2019s not my... What? I thought that was a closet. This is still my room?", "My room is way bigger than...", "I found the case. I found the case. I found the case. \u201cA minor upgrade\u201d? Whoa. Oh my God.", "What the...? This is the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen-", "But, yeah. Well, I don\u2019t understand. Is it for me? Happy, Happy, wait. This is insane. Insane. Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes. This is the greatest day of my life.", "Okay.", "Okay, there\u2019s Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow. Whoa. Who\u2019s that new guy?", "Oh, that\u2019s me. I gotta go. I gotta go. Hey, everyone. Okay, so the craziest thing just happened, right? I just had a fight with Captain America and I stole his shield and I threw it at him- What the hell? He\u2019s big now. I gotta go. Hang on. Whoa! It was the most amazing thing that\u2019s ever happened! So Mr. Stark was like, \u201cHey, Underoos!\u201d and I just sort of flipped in and I stole Cap\u2019s shield. I was like, \u201cHey, what\u2019s up, everybody?\u201d And then... Hey, just a second! Coming! Hey.", "Yeah.", "Yeah, hold on.", "An alibi? Sure.", "Okay.", "Mm-hmm.", "I can keep the suit?", "Yes.", "Wait, does that mean that I\u2019m an Avenger?", "I can take that. You don\u2019t have to take it.", "Yeah, I can take that.", "So when\u2019s, when\u2019s our next... When\u2019s our next \u201cretreat,\u201d you know? Like...", "Yeah, the mission. The missions.", "Do you have my numbers?", "Oh.", "From your team.", "They\u2019re gonna call me.", "What?", "No way! That\u2019s awesome. How many pieces?", "That\u2019s insane.", "No, I can\u2019t tonight. I\u2019ve got the Stark-", "Yeah, exactly.", "Yeah, well, hopefully, soon it\u2019ll lead to a real job with them.", "Right?", "That\u2019s exactly how they work.", "That\u2019d be great.", "Uh... Uh... Yeah, yeah. Uh... Mass cancels out, so it\u2019s just gravity times sine.", "Did Liz get a new top?", "We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy, though.", "I can\u2019t go to Washington because if Mr. Stark needs me, then I have to make sure that I\u2019m here.", "Hey, what\u2019s up?", "What\u2019s up, Mr. Delmar?", "Yeah, um, and, uh, with pickles, and can you smush it down real flat? Thanks.", "Yeah, she\u2019s alright.", "\u00bfC\u00f3mo est\u00e1 tu hija, eh?", "It\u2019s five dollars.", "Hey, come on, I\u2019m joking. I\u2019m joking. Here\u2019s five dollars. What\u2019s up, Murph? How you doing, buddy?", "Ah, you know, it\u2019s boring. Got better things to do.", "This is great.", "Ah, finally. Hey, could you hold this for a second? Thanks. Hey, is this anybody\u2019s bike? No? Hey, buddy, is this your bike?", "Does anyone have a pen? Do you have a pen? Whoo! Everybody good?", "Call me Spider-Man!", "Hey, buddy. Shouldn\u2019t steal cars. It\u2019s bad.", "I was just tryin\u2019 to-", "How was I supposed to know? He was putting that thing in the window!", "Ugh! I\u2019m good, I\u2019m good.", "Hey, Happy! Um, here\u2019s my report for tonight. I stopped a grand theft bicycle. Couldn\u2019t find the owner, so I just left a note. Um... I helped this lost, old Dominican lady. She was really nice and bought me a churro. So I just, um, feel like I could be doing more. You know? Just curious when the next real mission is gonna be. So, yeah, just call me back. It\u2019s Peter. Parker. Why would I tell him about the churro?", "Finally, something good.", "What\u2019s up, guys? You forgot your PIN number? Whoa! You\u2019re the Avengers. What are you guys doing here? Thor. Hulk. Good to finally meet you guys. I thought you\u2019d be more handsome in person. Iron Man. Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank? You\u2019re a billionaire. Hey! Oh, this feels so weird. Whoa, what is that thing? I\u2019m starting... to think... you\u2019re not... the Avengers!", "Alright guys, let\u2019s wrap this up. It\u2019s a school night. So, how do jerks like you get tech like this? No. Wait, wait, wait! Mr. Delmar. Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in there? Is anybody in here? Hello? Oh, come on. You\u2019ve got to be- Here, here.", "Happy, the craziest thing just happened to me. These guys were robbing an ATM with these high tech weapons-", "Yeah, but-", "Wait. Wait! You\u2019re moving? Who\u2019s moving?", "But what about me?", "Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me or something, I don\u2019t know, something big goes down? Can I please just talk to Mr. Stark?", "I am responsible. I- Oh, crap. My backpack\u2019s gone.", "I\u2019ll call you back.", "Uh, it\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s nothing!", "I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not.", "No, I wasn\u2019t. Ned, what are you doing in my room?", "You can\u2019t just bust into my room!", "No. He\u2019s got a thing.", "Nobody knows. I mean, Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit, but that\u2019s it.", "Yeah, basically.", "You can\u2019t tell anybody about this. You gotta keep it a secret.", "You know what she\u2019s like. If she finds out people try and kill me every single night, she\u2019s not going to let me do this anymore. Come on, Ned, please.", "Ned, May cannot know. I cannot do that to her right now, you know? I mean, everything that\u2019s happened with her, I... Please.", "Just swear it, okay?", "Thank you.", "I can\u2019t believe this is happening right now.", "No.", "I\u2019m gonna tell you about this at school tomorrow, okay?", "This is the Stark internship.", "Just get out of here.", "I\u2019m just stressed. The internship, and I\u2019m tired. A lot of work.", "Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.", "I... uh... I need a new backpack.", "I need a new backpack.", "I think he larbs you.", "The spider\u2019s dead, Ned.", "Yeah.", "What? No.", "No.", "No, Ned.", "It\u2019s unknown. Shut up.", "Shut up, Ned.", "Yeah, we met.", "I stole his shield.", "Shh!", "Shh!", "You have to shut up.", "Ned, just, shh, okay?", "What?", "Ned, I don\u2019t need a guy in the chair.", "No, I don\u2019t. No. I... I mean...", "I\u2019ve met him. Yeah. A couple times. But it\u2019s, um... through the Stark internship. Mm-hmm. Yeah, well. I\u2019m not really supposed to talk about it.", "Having a party?", "Um...", "What are you doing?", "This is a mistake. Hey, let\u2019s just go home.", "Uh-huh.", "Yeah, let\u2019s do it. Yeah. I\u2019m gonna go. I\u2019m gonna go.", "I will.", "Yeah.", "Hi, Liz.", "What a great party.", "Yeah.", "No, no, no. I can\u2019t... I cannot do this. Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay? Look, I\u2019m just gonna... be myself.", "Dude.", "Hey, what\u2019s up? I\u2019m Spider-Man. Just thought I\u2019d swing by and say hello to my buddy Peter. Oh, what\u2019s up, Ned? Hey, where\u2019s Peter, anyways? He must be around... God, this is stupid. What am I doing? What the hell? This sucks!", "Oh, this must be where the ATM robbers got their stuff.", "Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot at somebody, shoot at me.", "What was that? What? Ah!", "Oh, my butt! Unh! Great. Guess I\u2019m gonna have to take a shortcut. Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun. Hey, hey, buddy. Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch. Whoo! Now, this is more like it. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa. Smells really good! Great movie! Ugh... Oh, hey, guys.", "No! No! Hey, it\u2019s Peter. Leave a message.", "Almost got you. Thought you got away from me, didn\u2019t you? I got you right where I want you. Surprise! What the hell? Aahhhh! Huh? Oh, hey. And then he just, he just, like, swooped down like a monster and he picked me up and, uh, he took me up, like, a thousand feet and just dropped me. How\u2019d you find me? Did you put a tracker in my suit or something?", "Whoa! Whew, that\u2019s better. Thanks.", "The guy with the wings is obviously the source of the weapons. I gotta take him down.", "The Avengers?", "Anyway, Mr. Stark, you didn\u2019t have to come all the way out here. I had that. I was fine.", "Why?", "But I\u2019m ready for more than that now.", "That is not what you thought when I took on Captain America.", "Are you driving?", "No, I don\u2019t need to go to col- Mr. Stark-", "That\u2019s awesome. Stay close to the ground? What is he talking about? Whoa. Hey, man, what\u2019s up? I\u2019m on my way back.", "I\u2019ll see you tomorrow in school.", "Oh.", "Yeah, well, something came up.", "I don\u2019t know. Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.", "Yeah.", "Well, look, I think it\u2019s a power source.", "Whoever\u2019s making these weapons is obviously combining alien tech with ours.", "I gotta figure out what this thing is and who makes it.", "Let\u2019s do it.", "First, we gotta come up with a better name than \u201cglowy thingy.\u201d", "Crap. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.", "Hey, that\u2019s one of the guys that tried to kill me.", "Yeah.", "No, no, no, no, no. I gotta follow them. Maybe they can lead me to the guy that dropped me in the lake.", "Yeah, it was not good.", "No. Stay there, Ned.", "I know, right? They\u2019re in Brooklyn.", "Maryland?", "I don\u2019t know. Evil lair?", "Dude. A gang with alien guns run by a guy with wings? Yeah, they have a lair.", "It\u2019s not too far from D.C.", "Guys.", "Yeah, I was hoping maybe I could rejoin the team.", "Uh, strontium, barium, vibranium.", "Glad to be back.", "Can I take this real quick? I\u2019ll only be a sec.", "Hello?", "Tracker. Uh, yeah. No, it\u2019s just a school trip. It\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s nothing. Look, Happy, I gotta say, you tracking me without my permission is a complete violation of my privacy. That\u2019s different.", "Nothing. Look, it\u2019s just the Academic Decathlon. It\u2019s no big deal.", "Hey, you brought your laptop, right?", "Uh, because I gotta follow these guys to their boss before they move again and I don\u2019t really want Mr. Stark to know about it.", "No, I\u2019m not lying. He just doesn\u2019t really get what I can do yet. Ah... Gotcha. All right, Happy. Enjoy tracking this lamp.", "Hmm?", "What? \u201cTraining Wheels Protocol?\u201d Turn it off.", "Come on, man. I don\u2019t need training wheels. I\u2019m sick of him treating me like a kid all the time. It\u2019s not cool.", "Yeah, a kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands.", "Look, please. This is my chance to prove myself. I can handle it. Ned, come on.", "The guy in the chair.", "Come on. Yeah, the glowy thing, it\u2019s evidence. Keep it safe. All right?", "They\u2019re moving.", "Hey, Liz.", "What?", "Hey! I was, uh... I was gonna go study, um, in the business center.", "Hmm?", "Wow, you really... This is really important to you.", "Hello? Hello?", "Ah, thank you.", "S, I, I, put a tracker on someone. He\u2019s a bad guy.", "Okay, well, as long as I make it back in time for Decathlon, it\u2019s fine.", "Why is their secret lair in a gas station? That\u2019s so lame. Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?", "I can hear what they\u2019re saying? Uh, yeah.", "Whoa, that\u2019s so cool.", "Whoa, they\u2019re in the middle of a heist. I could catch them all red-handed. This is awesome. Okay, I\u2019m gonna get a little closer so I can see what\u2019s happening.", "Uh, Enhanced Combat Mode? Yeah.", "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don\u2019t want to kill anybody!", "What the hell just happened? What was that?", "Suit lady, what\u2019s wrong with my web-shooters?", "Why would I need rapid-fire?", "Whoa, Mr. Stark really overdid it.", "That one.", "No, no, no.", "What was that?", "Taser webs? I don\u2019t want taser webs.", "No, just... You choose.", "Oh, that\u2019s him.", "Whoa, cool. It\u2019s some kind of matter phase shifter.", "Hey, Big Bird! This doesn\u2019t belong to you! Oh, god. Suit lady, what was that?", "What? No, just set everything back to normal.", "Oh, my head.", "Hey, so where am I right now?", "Wait a minute. They must have hijacked the truck and taken me to their evil lair. Okay, suit lady. We\u2019re gonna have to fight our way out of this one. Three, two, one! What is this place?", "No. Seriously?", "Morning? Hey, suit lady, I kind of feel bad calling you \u201csuit lady,\u201d you know? I think I should probably give you a name... like Liz. No, no, no. God, that\u2019s... that\u2019s weird. What about Karen?", "Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do? What? Maybe we should run that refresher course.", "Ricochet web. Whoa! Cool.", "Web grenade! Should I tell Liz that I\u2019m Spider-Man?", "Who is Liz? She\u2019s.. heh. She\u2019s the best. She\u2019s awesome. She, uh, she\u2019s just a girl who goes to my school. And, uh... Yeah, I just... I really want to tell her, but it\u2019s kind of weird, you know? \u201cHey, I\u2019m... I\u2019m Spider-Man.\u201d", "What if she\u2019s expecting someone like Tony Stark? I mean, imagine how disappointed she\u2019d be when she sees me.", "Thanks, Karen. It\u2019s really nice to have somebody to talk to. Hey, how long we been here anyways?", "What? Thirty seven minutes? That\u2019s insane. I cannot take this anymore. I gotta... I gotta get out of here. There\u2019s got to be something in here I can use. Okay, let\u2019s see. Nope. That\u2019s awesome. Ah, hey, it\u2019s like the glowy thing.", "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You mean, we\u2019ve been carrying around a bomb?", "No, no, no, no, no. Hey! Please! Please, somebody, let me out! Hey! Karen, you have to help me override that time lock. Okay Karen. Lower the voltage and run it.", "Okay, we\u2019re just gonna have to try every sequence.", "It worked! It works!", "Karen, you have to get me to Decathlon as fast as possible.", "Right across the street from the Washington Monument.", "Ned, call me back! The glowy thing is a bomb!", "Oh, Ned, you\u2019re alive!", "Ned, Ned, where\u2019s the glowy thing, the glowy thing?", "No, Ned, listen! No, no, Ned, the glowy thing is dangerous.", "Ned, listen to me!", "Oh, hey, Liz.", "Please put Ned back on the phone.", "Liz, I have to talk to Ned. It\u2019s really important!", "Liz, there\u2019s something in Ned\u2019s backpack! It\u2019s really dangerous. Don\u2019t let it go through an X-ray. Liz? Liz! Damn it.", "No, no, no, no, no, no. Karen, what\u2019s going on up there?", "Oh, no.", "What? Uh... Don\u2019t worry, ma\u2019am. Everything\u2019s gonna be okay. Excuse me, excuse me. Oh, my god, that\u2019s tall.", "I'm going as fast as I can!", "What? Why?", "How do I get in there?", "Whoa, has that been there the whole time? That\u2019s awesome.", "Karen, I'm on my way. Ah! Okay. Oh, my god. Okay.", "It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just, I've just never been this high before.", "Perfect. Oh, my god. Why is it not breaking?", "My friends are in there! My friends are in there! Stop!", "I got this.", "Oh, I'm gonna die. Break!", "I did it! Whoa! Ahem. Hey, how you doing? Don't worry about it. I got you.", "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, big guy, quit moving around.", "Alright. This is your stop.", "Go, go, go. Everybody out! Move it, people. Move it, move it!", "You\u2019re okay. You\u2019re okay. Okay.", "So, uh, is everyone okay?", "Crazy, dude.", "No.", "No, dude, no, that\u2019s not a good idea.", "I\u2019m not going to class.", "Dude, listen, I figured it out, right? The wing suit guy is stealing from Damage Control.", "Ned, I'm probably never gonna come back here.", "I am so far beyond high school right now.", "May? Hey, Karen. What's up?", "Listen, I was wondering if you could help me. I'm trying to figure out who the guys under the bridge were that night, but I mean, I can only kind of remember part of a license plate.", "Footage?", "Everything?", "Like all the time?", "Yeah, of course it is. Um, yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.", "Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party. Hey, what's up, Liz? No, no, no. No, no, no. This is just me messing around. Go later in the day, later in the day. It is I, Thor, son of Odin! No, no, no, no, no, no.", "Fast-forward to the arms deal. Okay. The two on the right, who are they?", "Nothing?", "Let's pay him a visit.", "Uh, yeah. Remember me?", "I need information. You're gonna give it to me now.", "Come on!", "What do you mean, what happened to my voice?", "I'm not a girl! I'm a boy. I mean, I'm a... I'm a man.", "I'm not a girl! I'm a man. Come on, man. Look, who is selling these weapons? I need to know. Give me names or else.", "Deactivate interrogation mode. Look, man, these guys are selling weapons that are crazy dangerous. They can't just be out on the streets. Look, if one of them can just cut Delmar's bodega in half...", "Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.", "It's too much bread.", "Come on, man, please. Stupid interrogation mode. Karen, don't ever do that again.", "Who are these guys? What can you tell me about the guy with the wings?", "Really?", "Yes! Yes. Thank-", "Right, of course. Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just... Yeah. Where is it?", "Hmm?", "I don't understand. I'm intimidating.", "Oh, that's soon. Hey, that's gonna dissolve in two hours.", "Two hours. You deserve that.", "You deserve that. You're a criminal. Bye, Mr. Criminal. Nice. Okay, Karen, activate Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.", "It\u2019s the guy from the bridge, right? Who\u2019s that other guy?", "I can\u2019t talk right now. I\u2019ll call her back. Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy. We can\u2019t let anybody get away this time. Who\u2019s the guy on the left?", "No, Karen, stop it with the Instant Kill already.", "Dronie, scan the ship for a white pickup truck. Oh, this is too perfect. I got the weapons, buyers, and sellers all in one place.", "No, no, no. No, no, don\u2019t answer.", "Uh, I\u2019m actually at school.", "Okay.", "Uh, I\u2019m kind of in the middle of something right now.", "Uh, I\u2019m at band practice.", "I gotta go. Uh, end call.", "I\u2019ll take those! Yoink! Hey, guys. The illegal-weapons-deal-ferry was at 10", "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast. Are you guys okay? My bad. I gotta say the other guy was way better with that thing. I\u2019m honestly, I\u2019m, I\u2019m shocked.", "Wait, what do you mean, FBI?", "I know what the FBI means, but what are they doing here? Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Look out, look out, look out. Move, move, move!", "Activate Taser Web!", "Oh, my god. What do I do? Karen, uh, give me an X-ray of the boat and target all the strongest points. Web grenade. Web grenade. Splitter web, go.", "Ninety-eight?", "No, no, no, no! No! What the hell? What the hell...", "Uh, Mr. Stark? Hey, Mr. Stark. Could I do anything? What do you want me to do?", "Is everyone okay?", "No thanks to me? Those weapons were out there, and I tried to tell you about it. But you didn\u2019t listen. None of this would\u2019ve happened if you had just listened to me. If you even cared, you\u2019d actually be here.", "I\u2019m fifteen.", "Yes, sir.", "I, I\u2019m sorry.", "I understand. I just wanted to be like you.", "For how long?", "No, no, no... Please, please, please...", "You don\u2019t understand. Please. This is all I have. I\u2019m nothing without this suit.", "I don\u2019t have any other clothes.", "Hey.", "I\u2019m fine.", "May, I\u2019m okay. Honestly. Just relax. I\u2019m fine.", "I lost the Stark internship.", "Yeah.", "I just thought that I could work really hard and he could, he would, you know. But I screwed it up.", "I\u2019m sorry I made you worry.", "Yeah, I know.", "Yeah.", "I know.", "Okay.", "Pretty sure that\u2019s an urban myth, and no, I\u2019m not expelled.", "Me gusta hacer la tarea.", "Hey.", "I thought you had calculus fifth period.", "Hey, look, I, uh... I just wanted to apologize about the whole Decathlon thing. I really-", "No, I, I just mean that... it was not cool, especially...  ...because... I like you.", "You do?", "Yeah, you\u2019d be surprised. I got to get to class, but, um, I\u2019d say we should hang out, but I\u2019m gonna be in detention for...", "...ever, but, um, I guess you already have a date to homecoming.", "Uh, do you want to go with me?", "Really? I mean, uh, great. Cool.", "I\u2019m actually going that way. May, I need your help.", "Open the door for her.", "Tell her she looks nice, but not too much because that\u2019s creepy.", "No. And, uh, when I dance with her, I\u2019m putting my hands on her hips. I got this. Love you.", "Yeah.", "Thank you.", "Okay.", "Yeah.", "I\u2019m not old enough to drink.", "Yeah, you look really good.", "Sir, you don\u2019t have to drive us.", "Yeah, I will.", "What?", "Oh, um, I don\u2019t know.", "Yeah, no, I\u2019m just a sophomore.", "Yeah, actually, I don\u2019t intern for him anymore.", "Yeah, it got, um... boring.", "Yeah, he\u2019s nice. Nice man. Solid dude.", "Aww...", "It was a great party, really great, yeah. Beautiful house, a lot of windows.", "That was... I was there longer than two seconds.", "No, no. I did not disappear.", "Yeah, well, I actually didn\u2019t go up. I saw it all from the ground.", "Very lucky that he was there that day.", "Know what?", "Thank you.", "Gotta go. I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry. You don\u2019t deserve this.", "Ah, what the hell?", "My web-shooters...", "Ugh. Gross. Why did he send you here?", "Nice shot! Yes! Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz\u2019s dad.", "I know. I gotta tell Mr. Stark. Call Happy Hogan. He\u2019s Mr. Stark\u2019s head of security. And, uh, get a computer to track my phone for me.", "Hurry, we gotta catch him before he leaves town.", "Flash, I need your car and your phone.", "Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, hey, hey, can you hear me?", "Ned, I need you to track my phone for me.", "Hey, where are the headlights on this thing? I\u2019m in Flash\u2019s car.", "Okay, you\u2019re on speakerphone.", "Yeah, it\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s awe... Whoa! Get out of the way, get out of the way! Move! Move!", "I\u2019ve never really driven before. Only with May in parking lots. This is a huge step up... Hey, have you gotten through to Happy yet?", "Hey, Ned, how we coming on with those headlights?", "Left. Okay. Okay, perfect. So where\u2019s my phone now?", "What?", "What?", "Boxes? It\u2019s moving day. It\u2019s moving day! It\u2019s moving day! He\u2019s gonna rob that plane! I gotta stop him!", "What?", "Yeah. Just keep trying to get through to Happy.", "Hey!

And there's not a day that goes by that I don't regret having said yes. It was 1987. Separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk and launched an ICBM at the United States. The only way to the internal mechanics was through solid titanium. I knew I had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile. But my regulator has sustained too much damage. Your mother, she didn't hesitate. She turned off her regulator and went subatomic to deactivate the bomb. And she was gone. Your mom died a hero. And I spent the next ten years trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm. \nHope Van Dyne: [crying]\nYou were trying to bring her back. \nHank Pym: But all I learned was we know nothing. \nHope Van Dyne: It's not your fault. She made her choice. But why didn't you tell me that sooner? \nHank Pym: I was trying to protect you. I lost your mother. I didn't mean to lose you, too.", "Scott Lang: Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit. I don't even wanna know why you have it. \nHank Pym: Maggie was right about you. \nScott Lang: How do you know about... \nHank Pym: No wonder she's trying to keep you away from Cassie. The moment things get hard, you turn right back to crime. The way I see it, you have a choice. You can either spend the rest of your life in prison, or go back to your cell and await further instructions. \nScott Lang: I don't understand. \nHank Pym: No, I don't expect you to. But you don't have many options right now, and quite frankly, neither do I. Why do you think I let you steal that suit in the first place? \nScott Lang: What? \n[flashback showing Hank setting things in motion]\n\nHank Pym: Second chances don't come around all that much. So next time you think you might see one, I suggest you take a real close look at it.", "Scott Lang: [after his boss learns about his criminal record]\nDale, look, it wasn't a violent crime. I mean, I'm a good worker. \nDale: No, it wasn't a violent crime. It was a cool crime. I'll tell you what, though. This will be totally off the books, off the records, but, uh, if you want to grab one of those, uh, Mango Fruit Blasts on your way out the door, I'll just pretend I didn't see it.", "Scott Lang: [in a prison fight]\nYou didn't even move. \nPeachy: Nah. \nScott Lang: Okay, what if I come in on the left side, right? Just down here. You see this right here? \n[he slugs Peachy in the face; wiping blood from his lip, Peachy grins]\n\nPeachy: I'm gonna miss you, Scott. \nScott Lang: I'm gonna miss you, too, Peachy.

Some really skilled people. \nScott Lang: Not interested. \nLuis: Yeah, right. \nScott Lang: No, I'm serious, man. I'm not going back. I got a daughter to take care of. \nLuis: You know that jobs don't come easy for ex-cons, right? \nScott Lang: Look, man, I got a master's in electrical engineering, all right? I'm gonna be fine. \n[cut to him working at Baskin Robbins]", "Luis: That's Kurt. He was Folsom for five years. He's a wizard on that laptop. \nKurt: Nice meet you. \nScott Lang: Yeah, nice to meet you, too. Who are you? \nDave: Dave. Nice work on the Vista job. \nKurt: Vista job, yes. No, no. I have heard of this robbery. \nScott Lang: Well, technically, I didn't rob them. Robbery involves threat. I hate violence. I burgled them. I'm a cat buglar. \nDave: You mean you're a pussy. \nScott Lang: Yeah.", "Hope Van Dyne: Good morning, Hank. \nHank Pym: Hope. Would it kill you to call me \"dad\"?", "Hank Pym: The process is highly volatile. If one isn't protected by a specialized helmet, it can affect the brain's chemistry. I don't think Darren realizes this, and, you know, he's not the most stable guy to begin with. \nScott Lang: So, what do you want from me? \nHank Pym: Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption. Do you? \nScott Lang: I do. \nHank Pym: If you can help me, I promise I can help you be with your daughter again. Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?", "Hope Van Dyne: [Scott gets into her car's passenger seat]\nOh, god. \nScott Lang: You gotta lock your doors. I mean, really, there's some weird folks in this neighborhood. \nHope Van Dyne: Do you think this is a joke? Do you have any idea what he's asking you to risk? You have a daughter. \nScott Lang: I'm doing this for her. \nHope Van Dyne: You know when my mother died, I didn't see him for two weeks. \nScott Lang: He was in grief. \nHope Van Dyne: Yeah, so was I, and I was seven. And he never came back. Not in any way that counted. He just sent me off to boarding school. You know, I thought, with all that's at stake, just maybe we might have a chance of making peace. But even now, he still wants to shut me out. \nScott Lang: He doesn't want to shut you out. He trusts you. \nHope Van Dyne: Then why are you here? \nScott Lang: It proves that he loves you. Hope, look at me. I'm expendable. That's why I'm here. You must have realized that by now. I mean, it's why I'm in the suit and you're not. He'd rather lose this fight than lose you.", "Luis: Okay. I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto, which was mainly reds, and you know I don't love reds man, you know? But there was a ros\u00e9 that saved the day, it was delightful. And he tells me about this girl Emily that we used to kick it with, it was actually the first pair of boobs that I ever touched. \nScott Lang: It's the wrong details. It's wrong... It has nothing to do with the story. Go! \nLuis: So, uh, he tells me that she's working as a housekeeper now, right? And she's dating this dude Carlos who's a shot caller from across the bay and she tells him about the dude that she's cleaning for. Right? That he's, like, this big-shot CEO that is all retired now but he's loaded. And so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team and they get to talking, right? And here comes the good part. Carlos says: \"Yo, man. This guy's got a big-ass safe just sitting in the basement, just chillin'.\" Of course Ernesto comes to me cause he knows I've got mad thieving skills. Of course I ask him: \"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you to get to me what kind of safe it was? And he says: \"Nah, dog. All she said is that it's, like, super legit, and whatever's in it has gotta be good! \nScott Lang: What? \nKurt: Old man have safe. \nLuis: And he's gone for a week. \nScott Lang: Alright.

I thought it was a big eyebrow.", "Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that thing off your head.", "That's intense. To be honest, seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle.

You faked your own death, you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power, stranded him on Earth...

Oh brother, you're becoming predictable. I trust you, you betray me. Round and round in circles we go. See, Loki, life is about, it's about growth. It's about change. But you seem to just wanna stay the same. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you'll always be the God of Mischief, but you could be more. I'll just put this over here for you.

Get inside!", "I should probably go and help. Here, take the wheel.", "You're a scientist. Use one of your PhDs.", "Okay, drop me off at the palace and I'll draw her away.", "The people trapped down there are all that matters.

Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.", "There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize.", "But Jane's better.", "Oh, no, no, no.

It's much more than that.", "Well please, be my guest.", "Yeah!", "Yes, of course.", "Nothing.", "Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one.", "Who sent you?", "I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.", "Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter.

I'm building a Podracer!", "I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no luck.", "...and they blow you up...poof!", "Have you ever seen a Podrace? I'm the only human who can do it.  Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's never heard of a human doing it. I...I was wondering...something... Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you? I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon. I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight. I think you have...why else would you be here? Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?", "I can help! I can fix anything!", "I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...", "Watto doesn't know I've built it.  You could make him think it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.", "But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina pitty bad goo. We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other...", "Is that a yes? That is a yes!", "Bayno, Bayno!", "Ahhhh....it wasn't my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his vent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly.", "Padme and Jar Jar, this is my friend Kitster, and seek, Amee, and Wald.", "This isn't the half of it. I'm entered in the Boonta Race tomorrow!", "Hey! Jar Jar! Stay away from those energy binders...", "If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.", "It will. There are so many! Do they all have a system of planets? Has anyone been to them all? I want to be the first one to see them all... Ouch!", "What are you doing? I've never seen...", "You were in my dream...you were leading a huge army into battle.", "Hook 'em up, Kitster.  I won't be long. Where's Qui-Gon?", "What did he mean by that?", "Well...not exactly...", "...but Kitster's right, I will this time.", "I will, Mom. I promise.", "I won't let you down.", "Ah, gee...enough of this...", "Just feeling this good was worth it. He said I cheated. No!", " Yes! Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money we have!", "What?!? Did you hear that, Mom?  Was that part of the prize, or what?", "A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I get to go with you in your starship and everything?! But it's what I want. What I've always dreamed about. Can I go, Mom?! I want to go. Yipee!!  What about Mom? Is she free too? You're coming, aren't you, Mom QUI-GON : I tried to free your mother, Annie, but Watto wouldn't have it. But the money from selling...", "I want to stay with you. I don't want things to change.", "I'm going to miss you so much, Mom...", "Well, Threepio, I'm free...and I'm going away...in a starship...", "I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, Threepio...give you coverings and all... I'm going to miss working on you. You've been a great pal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything. Bye.", "I...  I... have to go.", "Well.", "I won't forget.  I can't do it, Mom. I just can't.", "Will I ever see you again?", "I hope so...yes...I guess.", "I.. will become a Jedi and I will come back and free you, Mom...I promise.", "I love you so much. I've been freed, and I'm going away. Buy yourself a cooling unit with this... Otherwise I'll worry about you.", "What is it? Master Qui-Gon,sir, wait! Qui-Gon's in trouble. He says to take off...now!!", "Are you all right? Do you think he'll follow us? What are we going to do about it? Pleased to meet you. Wow! You're a Jedi too?", "It's very cold.", "You seem sad.", "I'm...I'm not sure what's going to happen to me. I dunno if I'll ever see you again..  I made this for you. Sou you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet... It will bring you good fortune.", "I care for you too. Only I...miss...", "Wow! It's so huge!", "Don't look at me. I don't know what's going on.", "I'm...I'm looking for the handmaiden, Padme.", "I'd like to speak with Padme, if I could.", "I'm going to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope.  I may not see her again...and... I just wanted to say goodbye.", "Thank you, Your Highness. I'm sorry to have disturbed you.", "A ship...a cup...a speeder.", "Cold, sir.", "No, sir.", "I don't think so.", "I miss her.", " What's that got to do with anything?", " I am not afraid!", " I am not afraid.", "Master Qui-Gon, sir, I do not wish to be a problem. Master, sir...I've been wondering...what are midi-chlorians? They live inside of me? Symbionts? They do?? I don't understand.", "...and that one?", "And those control the pitch?", "Hi! Where have you been?", "I'm with Qui-Gon...but...they're not going to let me be a Jedi.", "Is it? I can help... Where are we going?", "I want to help...I'm glad you're back.", "All right. They're here!", "Sure.", "Hey! Wait for me.", "Oh, no...  We gotta do something, Artoo.  All right, thanks Artoo! Great idea! I'll take over.  Where's the trigger? Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this one....  Yeah, all right. \"Droid blaster.\" Yeah!  Oops...shield up! Always on the right...shields always on the right.  I know we're moving. I'll shut the energy drive down.  Oops!! Wrong one.  I'm not doing anything!  I know...I didn't push anything.", "The Autopilot is searching for what other ships?  There is no manual override, Artoo. You'll have to rewire it or something.  Look! There they are! That's where the autopilot is taking us.", "Whoo, boy! This is tense!", " I've got control?  Okay, let's go left!  Yes...I've got control. You did it, Artoo!  Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit and that's what I'm gonna do. Now c'mon!  Oops! Whoa!  I'll try spinning, that's a good trick.  I know we're in trouble! Hang on! The way out of this mess is the way we got into it.  Which one? This one?", "I know, Artoo! This isn't Podracing!  We're hit!  Great gobs of bantha poo-doo!  I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop! Whoa!  All right! All right! Get the system started!  Everything's overheated. All the lights are red.", "Uh oh. This is not good.  The systems are still overheated, Artoo.", "Yes...we have ignition.", "Not if I can help it! Shields up!  This should stop them.  ...and take this!  Darn...I missed!  Let's get out of here!  Now, this is Podracing! Whoopee!", "I'm not going to get into trouble, am I?", "What will happen to me now?", "Hold on.", "The Separatists are taken care of, My Master.", "Thank you, My Master.", "Very good, My Lord.", "Yes, My Master.  Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?", "I couldn't have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It's impossible! No!!!", "But, I...", "Hi, Jar Jar.", " So have you... grown more beautiful, I mean... and much shorter... for a Senator, I mean.", "We will find out who is trying to kill you Padm\u00e9, I promise you. I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course. Why? Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security... not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.", "She didn't even recognise me, Jar Jar. I thought about her every day since we parted... and she's forgotten me completely.", "Yes, my master.", "Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her. She covered that camera. I don't think she liked me watching her. She programmed Artoo to warn us if there's an intruder. I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don't we, Master? It was her idea... No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me. And yours are? I don't sleep well, anymore. I don't know why I keep dreaming About her now. I haven't seen her since I was little. I'd rather dream of Padm\u00e9. Just Being around her again is... intoxicating. She's not like the others in the Senate, Master. Not another lecture, Master. Not on the economics of politics.... It's too early in the morning... and besides, you're generalising. The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt. I think he is a good man. My instincts are very positive about... Stay here! That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic. Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't find a speeder I really liked, with an open cockpit... and with the right speed capabilities... and then you know I had to get a really gonzo color... I thought I already did. Sorry, I forgot you don't like flying, Master. Master, you know I've been flying since before I could walk. I'm very good at this. Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this guy's gonna kill himself any minute now! Right - this isn't working. Clear that! Clear the flag! We're losing power! Hurry! So sorry, Master. Sorry, Master! That was crazy!!!  Ahh, damn. No, we can make it. But it worked... we made it. I think we're still alive.  I could have made it... No we didn\u0092t... This is a shortcut... I think. Master, if we keep this chase going, that creep\u0092s gonna end up deep fried. Personally, I\u0092d very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who he\u0092s working for... I\u0092m deeply sorry, Master.  Excuse me for a moment. She went into that club, Master. Sorry, Master. Yes, Master. I know, Master. I've heard this lesson before... I try, Master. Don't say that Master... You're the closest thing I have to a father... I love you. I don't want to cause you pain. I will. I'll do better, I promise. I think he's a she... Where are you going, Master?", "Easy... Official business. Go back to your drinks.", "Tell us!", "Who hired you? Tell us... tell us now!", "Don't worry. Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find that bounty hunter.", "Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.", "Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying to...", "Please don't call me that.", "Annie...", "It's Anakin. When you say Annie it's like I'm still a little boy... and I'm not.", "Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it...", "Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only... although I'm a Padawan learner, in some ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I'm too unpredictable... Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it... I know I started my training late... but he won't let me move on.", "It's worse... he's overly critical. He never listens! He just doesn't understand! It's not fair!", "I'm not whining! I'm not.", "I know...", "I am grown up. You said it yourself.", "Why not?", " Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers too?", "Sorry, M'lady.", "Yes, Master.", "Time to go.", "May the Force be with you, Master.", "I'm kinda scared too. This is my first assignment on my own.", "No, no, Mom, no...  What?", "Thank you.", "I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I've thought about it every day since I left. It's by far the most beautiful place I've ever seen...", "I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception.", "Or be with the people I love.", "Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love.", "You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either.", "I can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualise the Force, those hills are what I see.  I love Naboo.", "Yes... I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. I don't want to lose it. Recently I've been seeing her in my dreams... vivid dreams... scary dreams. I worry about her.", "If I grew up here, I don't think I'd ever leave.", "No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about... The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers...", "Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?", "The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.", "I agree! I think the Republic needs you... I'm glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.", "The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were told.", " Hey, hold on a minute!", "Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady.", " Sorry, M'Lady.", " No, but I...", "Hello.", "A little.", "...Yes... I'm afraid she is.", "Padme tells me you teach at the university?", "There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there'll be more. My Master is tracking down the assassins. I'm sure he'll find out who they are. This situation, won't last long.", "I don't either.", "I just want to get there before dark.  You still live at home.", "I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mom was.  Is this you?", "I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.", "I don\u0092t like sand. It\u0092s coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything\u0092s soft... and smooth...", " Everything here is magical.", "Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway...", "I think it's true...", "I'm sorry. When I'm around you, my mind is no longer my own.", "...the view.", "What?", "I'm not really supposed to do that... for fun, I mean. If Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be very grumpy. May I tell you something?", "Then how can I tell you?", "It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you.", "From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask...  If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me.", "Anything's possible. Padme, please listen...", "Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that.", "I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can't.", "It wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret.", "...No, you're right. It would destroy us.", "Sure you do... you just don't want to tell me.", "They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded.", "All right, I get the picture... whatever happened to him?", "Maybe he was the smart one.", "I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them.  I don't think the system works.", "We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.", "Then they should be made to.", "I don't know. Someone.", "Of course not me.", "Someone wise.", "Well, if it works...", " On no, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator.", "You're always so serious. Always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders.", "No...No...No...Mom!...Don't, no, don't!  Don't go.", "Your presence is soothing.", "Jedi don't have nightmares.", "I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She's suffering, Padme. She is in pain...They're killing her!  I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I have to help her! I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a choice.", "What about Master Obi-wan?", " Wait, please.", " Excuse me, Watto.", " I said excuse me.", "Let me help you with that.  I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.", "My mother...", "Sold her...", "Do you know where they are?", "I'd like to know.", "Threepio?", "I've come to see my mother.", "I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here looking for my mother.", "Is my mother here?", "To find my mother.", "I can feel her pain, and I will find her. I know she's alive. You are going to have to stay here. These are good people, Padme. You'll be safe.", "I trust you'll watch over her, Owen.", "I won't be long.", "Mom... Mom... Mom...", "I\u0092m here, Mom. You\u0092re safe. Hang on. I\u0092m going to get you out of here...", "Just stay with me, Mom. I\u0092m going to make you well again. Everything\u0092s going to be fine.", "I'm going after him!", "Yeah, you're right, you're right.", "Understood, Master.", "If he's still alive.", "...He's like my father, but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.", "Hey, where are you going?", "No! You're not!", "I'm not letting you go out there. It's too dangerous.", "It's my job to protect you. I said it's too dangerous. You're not going, and that's final!", "Don't be afraid.", "What are you talking about?", "You love me?! I thought we decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. That it would destroy our lives...", "I have no desire to be cured of this love either. Long or short, I vow to spend the rest of my life with you. I retransmitted it as you requested, Master. Then we decided to come and rescue you.", "I have a bad feeling about this. What about Padme?", "You okay?", "Jump!!!", "It's Dooku, go after him!  Padme!!!  Put the ship down! Down! No we're not!! Land this ship! I don't care!.. Go back.", "I'm taking him now! You'll pay for all the Jedi you've killed today, Dooku.", "I'm a slow learner.", "Don't bet on it!", " : Oops! Artoo, get us off Autopilot!", "No batta!", "There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . . Break left, fly through the guns on that tower. Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you. Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . .  We got him, Artoo! I copy, Artoo. Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver.  Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on! We're locked on ... we've got him . . .  Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo. Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead.  The one crawling with vulture droids. Come on, Master.", "This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side. I'm going head to head. See you.", "Incoming!! Here we go. Hang on. There are four more of them. I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail. How many back there. Artoo?  Three . . .  Four . . . that's not good. I know. I know! I know. I know! I'm going low and left. Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . . Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before. Wrong thought, Artoo.  I'm through.", "I'm going to go help them out! Missiles! Pull up! They're coming around! Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters. We got 'em. Artoo! I see them . . . Buzz Droids. Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them. Steady . . . steady . . . I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . . Move to the right. I'm not leaving without you, Master. Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out! Yeah, you got him! Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar. Oh?!? Sorry, Master. Tap into the ship's computers. I sense Count Dooku . . . Next move? Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.", "Ready. Well then, we're safe for the time being. They're sealing this section off. Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way. I found our escape vent. Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . . Here's a way out. The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized. Destroyers!!", "No, did you? Well, there's more than one way out of here.", "What was that all about? No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can. He's trying! Are you all right?", "I was about to say that.", "My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.", "I shouldn't . . .", "... I couldn't stop myself.", "Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.  I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.", "He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.", "His fate will be the same as ours.", "The elevator's not working,  Artoo . . .  . . . Activate Elevator 3224.  Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!", "We can't wait. Come on, we have to be fast.", "Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation.", "Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator! Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy? I agree.", "I don't know. Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.", "Ray shields! Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted. You're the Master. I'm just a hero.", "I say . . . patience. Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . .  See! No problem.", "General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.", "Artoo.", "All the escape pods have been launched. You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing? Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in. Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins. We lost something. Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down. What's our speed? Grab that . . . Keep us level. Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.", "We're coming in too hot.  Are you coming, Master? Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time. All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness. All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .", "Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.", "I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.", "Excuse me.", "I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.", "I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.", "Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.", "I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.", "Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?", "That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?", "You're frightened.  Tell me what's going on!", ". . . Is there someone else?", " I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.", "It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .", "That's . . . that's wonderful.", "We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.", ". . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.", "You are so beautiful!", "No, it's because I'm so in love with you.", "Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . .", "I haven't laughed in so long . . .", "Nothing . . .  I remember when I gave this to you.", "It was a dream.", "Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.", "It was about you.", "It was only a dream.  You die in childbirth . . .", "I don't know.", ". . . I won't let this one become real, Padme.", "I know ", " Have you told him anything?", "He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!", "I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.", "They are of pain, suffering, death . . .", "Someone . . .", "Yes.", "I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.", "What must I do, Master Yoda?", "I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse. What's wrong then? Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war. Be careful of what? What for? He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it? I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?", "The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?", "I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.", "With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.", "Everyone will agree on that.", "Of course.", "What do you mean?", "I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.", "For what? I don't understand.", "Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.", "I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.", "I understand.", "What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?", "Forgive me, Master.", "I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.", "What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting! I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . . That has nothing to do with this. You mean divided loyalties. The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve. Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie. I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying. And? What situation? They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason! Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session? The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here. Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer. You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?", "Beautiful, isn't it?", "How are you feeling?", "He?! Why do you think it's a boy?", "Whoa!

When she gets there, destroy her.", "Viceroy, is the planet secure?", "Good. I will see to it that in the Senate, things stay as they are. I am sending Darth Maul to join you. He will deal with the Jedi.", "This is an unexpected move for her. It's too aggresive..", "Be patient... Let them make the first move.", "...she is more foolish than I thought.", "The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect the Queen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that conenant.... This will work to our advantage...", "Proceed. Wipe them put...all of them. INT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - DAY  All is peaceful. SMALL CRITTERS drink out of a large swamp lake. Suddenly there is a disturbance in the middle of the lake. A rush of bubbles, then a GUNGAN SOLDIER riding a KAADU emerges from the water, followed by SEVERAL OTHERS. FROGS and OTHER LITTLE ANIMALS flee in all directions as the GUNGAN ARMY marches through the swamp. The KAADU shake themselves off as they exit the lake. When JAR JAR's KAADU shakes off, JAR JAR falls off.", " Count Dooku.", "Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.", "Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!", "Do it!!", "You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.", "It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.  Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.", "Leave him, or we'll never make it.", "What are we going to do?", "Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.", "The hull is burning up!", "Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.", "That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.", "Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.", "They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.", "There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.", "Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.", "Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.", "I need your help, son.", "I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.", "Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.", "To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .  Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.", "I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.", "Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.", "I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far ", "Sit down,  Leave us.  Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.", "You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.", "Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?", "Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.", "Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?  They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?", "Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. \"All those who gain power are afraid to lose it.\" Even the Jedi.", "Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .", ". . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.", "And the Jedi don't?", "Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?", "Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.  Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis \"the wise\"?", "I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.", "The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.", "He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.  Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.", "Not from a Jedi.", "Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?", "We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.", "There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.", "They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.", " No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.", "Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.  Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.", "I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.", "I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .", "You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.", "I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.", "I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.  Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.", "They are not to be trusted.", "These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.", "I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.", "Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.", "We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.", "It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?", "They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.", "My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.", "Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.  They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.", "Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.", "Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .", "I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.", "Are you going to kill me?", "I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.", "Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?", "You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.  I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate. Perhaps you'll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all . . .", " You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.", "Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.", "Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?", " I am the Senate!", "It's treason, then.", "Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.", "No! No! You will die! He is a traitor, Anakin.", "Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.", "You are not one of them, Anakin. Don't let him kill me.", "I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.", "Help me! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . I can't ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don't kill me. I give up. I'm dying. I can't hold on any longer.", "I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.", "Please don't, please don't . . .", "Please don't . . .", "Power! Unlimited power!", "You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.", "Good.", "To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.", "Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader.", "Rise, Darth Vader. Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.", "Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don't you?", "We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.", "Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.", ". . . and the Jedi Rebellion has been foiled.", "The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated.  Any collaborators will suffer the same fate.", "The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger. The war is over.  The Separatists have been defeated,  and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning.", "In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.  An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . .  An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new constitution . . .", "Double your search.  Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff.", "I sense Lord Vader is in danger.", "Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have done well.", "Excellent.  Everything is going as planned.", "Execute Order Sixty-Six.", "You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice, Darth Vader, arrives, he will take care of you.", "Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He's still alive. Get a medical capsule, immediately.", "Good. Good.  Lord Vader, can you hear me?", "I'm afraid she died. ... it seems in your anger, you killed her.", "General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.", "The end of the war is near, General, and I promise you, victory is assured.", "His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.", "Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.", "Commander 1138 . . . The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.", "Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing?", "Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire.", "It is finished, then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy. You have done well, Lord Vader.", "Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. Tell them the Separatist leaders have been wiped out. Grievous and Dooku have been destroyed. All droid units must shut down immediately.", "Master Yoda, you survived.", "Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience the full power of the dark side. I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At last, the Jedi are no more.", "You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.", "The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.", "The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.", "...How could that be true? I have assurances from the Chancellor...his Ambassaodrs did arrive. It must be the...get...negotiate...", "It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.", "There is a question of precedure, but I feel confident we can overcome it...", "...the Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates who are only looking out for themselves and their home sytems. There is no interest in the common good...no civility, only politics...its disgusting. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is little chance the Senate will act on the invasion.", "If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real power...he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. A manufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now.", "Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces the laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.", "Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the courts...", "To be realistic, Your Highness, I'd say we're going to have to accept Federation control for the time being.", "If the Federation moves to defer the motion...Your Majesty, Ibeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session.", "You must force a new election for Supreme Chancellor...I promise you there are many who will support us...it is our best chance...", "Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has occured on our peaceful system of Naboo. We have become caugt in a dispute you're all well aware of, which began right here with the taxation of trade routes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppresion of the Trade Federation.", "To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, the recently elected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our behalf.", "Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will dissapear.", "You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is with us...Valorum will be voted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...", "A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. I promise, Your Majesty, if I am elected, I will bring democracy back to the Republic. I will put an end to corruption. The Trade Fedreation will lose its influence over the bureaucrats, and our people will be freed.", "I feel confident...our \"situation\" will create a strong sympaphy vote for us... I will be Chancellor, I promise you.", "I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet. The law is in their favor.", "Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! You would be in danger. They will force you to sign the treaty.", "It's good to be home. Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty.

I don't like it.", "We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in? Not bad.", "I'm not afraid of anything...", "Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward. This isn't a game, you know.", "Anything I want!  Now that's interesting.", "How much do you think she's talking about? I'm beginning not to like you.", "Who's going to pay me then?", "I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.", "Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?", "Well, I've brought you here.  What now?", "The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.", "You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.", "I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?", "What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it. I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.", "I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless. I'd better go see how he's doing.", "Where are you taking us now anyway?", "What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?", "Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.", "Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.", "Was this trip really necessary?", "Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!", "I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help. I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.", "Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.", "I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.", "Get to the ship! Move out of the way!", "Watch it!  Move back. No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.", "Not if this tunnel deadends.", "Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.", "I think I did.", "This isn't going to work. Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.", "You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?", "Don't you believe it.", "No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son! All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.", "Why?", "I found it... It's just not there. Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.", "I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side. It's automatic.", "You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.", "Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand."], "Jango_Fett": ["Once or twice.  Possibly... Boba, close the door.  Master who? Never heard of him. I was recuited by a man called Darth Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden.", "Do you like your army?  They'll do their job well, I'll guarantee that. Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.", "Fairly.", "That right? I'm just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe, Master Jedi.", "Nearly there, son.", "Hang on!", "Stay calm, son. We'll be fine. That Jedi won't be able to follow us through this.", "We won't see him again.", "I'll take that weapon."]}
