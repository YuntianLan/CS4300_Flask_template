{"id": "Phil_Coulson", "name": "Phil Coulson", "fandom": "marvelcinematicuniverse", "url": "https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Phil_Coulson", "personality": ["Agent Coulson has many different aspects to his personality. He will often be serious and even threatening when a situation calls for it, shown prominently in the fight against HYDRA. He was harsh to Thomas Nash while he was still believed to be the Clairvoyant, even telling the man to go to Hell. He is also practical, calmly facing the difficult truth that he was going insane from Project T.A.H.I.T.I.. He will put others' needs before his own, illustrated when he was determined to keep Audrey Nathan from knowing of his existence, as he wanted to allow her to heal from her grief. For the greater good, Coulson will put himself through much suffering, as he put himself back into the Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine to dig up necessary information. Coulson was literally ready to give his life for the mission: as such, he bonded with the Spirit of Vengeance, accepting to give up on the effects of the GH.325 which had been keeping him alive since his resurrection so that Aida could be defeated.\n", "Coulson also has a humorous side, often displayed in the form of witty or sarcastic comments, especially when hanging around the few people he fully trusts, such as when he and Melinda May went undercover as a married couple. He can be carefree when off-duty, such as when bonding with the members of his team following a successful mission and Leo Fitz fell for a prank. He is also caring, treating his team as family, and protecting them at all costs. While sometimes he presents bad news gently, he knows when it is necessary to present it bluntly. An example of this is when he told Melinda May that she would need to put him down if he went insane. On the other side, Coulson can be quite giddy on occasion, as when he finally met Captain America after being a fan his whole life. He became nervous, and was quite awkward during the meeting.\n", "Coulson has also displayed great interpersonal skills, being able to handle Tony Stark and make him join the Avengers Initiative when S.H.I.E.L.D. needed him most, to recruit Skye from being an anti-S.H.I.E.L.D. \"hacktivist\" and transform her into a loyal field agent, and calm down emotionally unstable Michael Peterson due to the effects of the Extremis in his body.\n", "However, after the events that caused Coulson to lose his hand, as well as to lose Rosalind Price, he has begun to demonstrate a colder and ruthless side, as shown when he was willing to kidnap Thomas Ward in retaliation for Price's murder at the hands of Grant Ward. Additionally, Coulson chose to kill Ward in cold blood, while Ward was handcuffed and defenseless. However, Coulson later blamed himself for this deed and acknowledged that he had crossed a line he had swore he would never breach.\n", "Due to their long history, Coulson also has a romantic interest in Melinda May, however, their relationship never got the chance to fully develop. Coulson never built a family of his own, but ended up having a father-daughter relationship with his new protégée Skye, which both of them ackowledged on several occasions. Over the numerous times when Daisy Johnson was willing to give up on her life in S.H.I.E.L.D., be it when she left S.H.I.E.L.D. after the death of Lincoln Campbell or when Johnson intended to remain in year 2091 to prevent the destruction of the Earth, Coulson never gave up on her, as he deeply cared for her and even considered Johnson as his most promising successor into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s directorship.\n", "Coulson describes himself as realist, not believing Robbie Reyes made a \"deal with the devil\". However, he was forced to reevaluate his perspective during his encounter with the Ghost Rider ; when asked what Robbie was, Coulson admitted that the flaming skull thing was \"a compelling argument for hail Satan.\"\n", "By his own admission, Coulson is not afraid of death. When stabbed through the heart by Loki he sarcastically mocked the God of Mischief and even had the strength to attack him. He even encourages Fury to use his death as motivation for the Avengers with his final words. Since being resurrected, Coulson has shown less interest in anything that might prolong his life, especially anything Kree related as can be shown by how he does not attempt to use the methods that brought Tess back from the dead in the Lighthouse especially because the experience of being revived GH.325 was so terrible Coulson begged to be put down as it was being performed on him. However, the Fear Dimension reveals that Coulson harbors some fear of his own mortality such as that all of his experiences will amount to nothing, his legacy will never be remembered and the relationships he made that are closer than family amount to nothing. In his words, though Coulson has accepted his death he is willing to fight against it for the greater good.\n"], "quotes": [["\"I spent time with Coulson. He's a good man.
