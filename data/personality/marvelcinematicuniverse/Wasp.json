Hope is also very snarky, as shown when she mocked Lang by calling him \"princess\" or \"useless\" when he acted incompetent. Hope is generally self-assured and blunt, being brutally honest about Scott's poor hero skills and his friends' unimpressive thieving reputation. In spite of her candid demeanor, she does try to motivate Lang by encouraging him, tutoring him and telling him that he's not that much of a failure when he did eventually improve. Hope even grows to respect Lang and becomes proud of him when he demonstrates that he learned what she has been teaching him. She eventually became romantically affectionate towards Scott, but showed slight embarrassment for it.\n", "Hope had a strained relationship with Hank following her mother's apparent death, but after he revealed the truth, reconciled with him and even during the strain asked his help in stopping Darren Cross from enacting his plans. She was very much close to her mother than her father during her childhood, but she loved both of them as she resented Hank for keeping her away after her mother seemingly died.\n", "Some of Hank's cynical nature rubbed onto Hope as well. Her relationship with Scott had gotten strained following the latter using their technology to help Captain America violate the Sokovia Accords and seemingly \"destroyed\" the Ant-Man suit. She was initially still angry at him and gave him cold responses up until the point where Scott revealed he had in fact saved it. The two soon mended their relationship, with Scott even wanting her as a partner.\n"], "personality_quotes": [], "figure_captions": [], "quote": ["\"If I had asked, would you have come?\"\"I guess we’ll never know.

When the CEO of Pym Technologies, Darren Cross, attempted to create and sell a new weapon based on her father's Ant-Man Suit, van Dyne reunited with her father and, along with an ex-con named Scott Lang as the new Ant-Man, was able to defeat Cross. After these events, Hank found the possibility of saving his wife due to Lang's first experience in the Quantum Realm, from which van Dyne was finally being offered by her father a suit that belonged her mother, to become the new holder of the mantle of Wasp.\n"}
