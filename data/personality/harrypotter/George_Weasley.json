When Draco Malfoy insulted his parents and Harry's mother due to his team losing the Quidditch match, both he and Harry gave him a severe beating and was not at all remorseful of doing it.\n", "George's prankster nature is enjoyed by nearly everyone in his family, aside from his brother Percy and his mother, who both consider jokes to be immature and childish. However, his pranks targeted at Percy were usually good-natured, and the only thing that got hurt was Percy's pride. He and Fred particularly enjoyed teasing Percy and their younger brother Ron,[8] while they were especially close to their sister Ginny, who was similar to them in temperament.[13] However, they were protective of their siblings, and eventually extended this familial protectiveness towards Ron's friends Harry Potter and Hermione Granger (who later became their in-laws).\n", "Both he and Fred were renowned for their senses of humour; they were able to make people laugh and relax even in very trying times. Neither George nor Fred took school very seriously, but they were both very talented wizards, and demonstrated their ingenuity in their inventions and their business sense in running a highly lucrative shop. They were also staunchly loyal to their loved ones and very brave, (as evidenced by their been sorted into Gryffindor) and unafraid to stand up against what they thought was wrong, whether it was Dolores Umbridge's tyranny at Hogwarts or Death Eaters.\n"], "quotes": [["George: \"What made you see sense, Perce?\"\n", "Percy Weasley: \"It’s been coming for a while...
