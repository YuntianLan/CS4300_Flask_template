Goyle was also very sadistic and had no qualms about using the Cruciatus Curse to torture fellow students. However, while he did poorly in Defence Against the Dark Arts, he excelled in the actual Dark Arts class, being top of the class due to his sadistic tendency to use fellow students as practise subjects for curses.\n"], "quotes": [["\"Reading?
