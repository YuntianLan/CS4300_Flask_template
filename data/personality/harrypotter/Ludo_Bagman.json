He was never convicted, and it is likely that if he did pass any information to Rookwood, he did so innocently, not knowing Rookwood was working for Voldemort.\n", "It is worth mentioning, however, that at least two people in 1994 suspected him of foul play, or at least mistrusted him: both Rita Skeeter (unreliable though she was) and Barty Crouch Jr (masquerading as Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody) mentioned this in the presence of Harry, Ron and Hermione. Rita Skeeter said to Hermione: \"I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl - not that it needs it.\" This is likely a reference to the aforementioned accusation of passing information to Rookwood.\n", "Bagman was seen as a genuinely nice person to all who knew him. However, he had a weakness for gambling which put a financial strain on him. (He might have originally borrowed off the goblins to pay off gambling debts). As George Weasley stated: \"He's lost everything gambling.\" He could also turn very nasty when it came to paying his losses, as he used worthless Leprechaun gold to pay, and refused to pay real money when the winners came to him. He also attempted to cheat at certain times when he was in a desperate situation, such as helping Harry during the Tournament, despite being forbidden to do so. Ludo went as far as running away after losing his final bet against his goblin creditors, which resulted in them refusing to side with humans during the Second Wizarding War.[9]\n"], "personality_quotes": [["\"Well - I know I've been a bit of an idiot...\"\"You never spoke truer words, boy.\"", "—Ludo and Alastor Moody (sotto voce) at the former's trial[src]\n"]], "figure_captions": ["Ludo with the Quidditch World Cup trophy"], "quote": ["Bagman: \"... if I can help at all... a prod in the right direction...
