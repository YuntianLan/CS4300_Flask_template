When she insulted Hermione Granger in 1997, Ron urged her not to take it personally, since Muriel was rude to everybody. Among her other insulting remarks were that Xenophilius Lovegood looked \"like an omelette\" in his yellow robes, that Ron's long hair made him nearly indistinguishable from his sister, that George's ears were \"lopsided\" after his right ear had been magically cut off, and that Ginny's dress was \"far too low cut.\" She also seemed slightly disdainful of Hermione's Muggle-born status[3] and of Fleur being French.[12] Muriel liked to use her advanced age as a justification for her impolite actions, in spite of the fact that she seemed quite strong for her age.[7]\n", "Muriel enjoyed gossip and was a fan of Rita Skeeter, stating that she \"always\" read Rita's work, and that she was eager to pre-order a copy of her book The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.[7]\n", "Despite her rude behaviour, Muriel does have a soft side, as she lent her Goblin forged tiara to Fleur for her wedding with Bill and, more importantly, when the Weasley family was in danger of being arrested by Death Eaters, allowed them to hide in her home.\n"], "quotes": [["Ron Weasley: \"Wow. You look great!\"\n", "Hermione Granger: \"Your Great-Aunt Muriel doesn't agree. I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara. She said, ‘Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?' and then, ‘Bad posture and skinny ankles'.\"\n"]], "figure_captions": []}
