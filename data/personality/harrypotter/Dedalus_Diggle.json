{"id": "Dedalus_Diggle", "name": "Dedalus Diggle", "fandom": "harrypotter", "url": "https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dedalus_Diggle", "personality": ["Diggle was a person who was often very cheerful, enthusiastic and friendly. He was excited when he learned about Voldemort's downfall, and he started to admire Harry Potter. He also thought that he would flatter Vernon Dursley by telling that it was very clever to drive, and that he could not drive a car, however, this simply angered Vernon. Diggle also thought that he and Hestia Jones would be best friends with the Dursleys, showing he was a very friendly and good-natured wizard, but also perhaps somewhat naive, as he did not expect the Dursleys to be as unpleasant as they really were. He was also perhaps somewhat clumsy and careless, as Minerva McGonagall told Albus Dumbledore she never thought he had much common sense, when telling Dumbledore she believed him to be responsible for causing a downfall of shooting stars across Kent, a feat which was witnessed by Muggles and regarded as highly unusual.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
