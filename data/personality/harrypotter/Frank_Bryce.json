He was not very sociable; according to the Riddles' cook, he \"never wanted to mix\". After his experiences during the War, he developed a great dislike of crowds and loud noises. When the time finally came to take action, he managed his fear much easier; in 1994, despite being terrified of the murderer who was standing besides a door in the Riddle House, Frank confronted him when he was caught eavesdropping.[1] Upon his temporary return to Earth, during the duel between Harry and Voldemort, he seemed to have a dry acceptance of his death. Bryce supported the former, despite never meeting him before, while distracting the latter in revenge for killing him.\n"], "quotes": [["\"Always thought he was odd. Unfriendly, like. I'm sure if I've offered him a cuppa once, I've offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn't.\"", "â€”The Riddles' cook on Frank Bryce[src]\n"]], "figure_captions": []}
