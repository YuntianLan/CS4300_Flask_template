{"id": "Sif", "name": "Sif", "fandom": "marvelcinematicuniverse", "url": "https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sif", "personality": ["Being one of the best warriors in Asgard, Sif is very proud and always eager to prove herself. She is a very close friend of Thor and the Warriors Three, and is an honorable warrior on the battlefield. She often is independent and uneasy in following orders, although she has shown unwavering loyalty to Odin. Unlike many other Asgardians, Sif does not view humans as lesser beings. Sif also harbors romantic feelings for Thor, being protective of him, jealous of his love for Jane Foster and showing a willingness to aid him even if it means treason. Despite her desire for Thor, she was ready to help in his mission to save Jane, showing a great level of selflessness and honor.\n"], "quotes": [["\"I am no monster.
