However, after having the Photostatic Veil permanently implanted, Agent 33 became blindly loyal to Whitehall until his death, even to the point of fear, where any failure on her part was met with an immediate apology. Even after Whitehall's death, the brainwashing process was strong enough to hinder her making decisions for herself; however she showed proof of her strong will by deciding to find again herself with Grant Ward's help.\n", "Despite originally being a kindhearted and caring person, as shown by nursing Ward back to health after Puerto Rico, Agent 33 became a cruel and sadistic person under the influence of Ward, as shown when she kidnapped Sunil Bakshi and put him through the Faustus method to show him what she endured. She later kidnapped and tortured Bobbi Morse when she remembered that Morse told her location to HYDRA when undercover.\n", "Having regained her memories, she seemed to become very proud about her identity, correcting Phil Coulson immediately when he called her \"Agent 33\" rather than her real name, \"Kara\".\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
