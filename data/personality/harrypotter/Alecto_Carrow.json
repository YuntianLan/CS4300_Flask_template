Indeed, Neville even claimed that Alecto \"made Umbridge look tame\"[16]. Alecto had strong pure-blood supremacist beliefs (specifically the belief in blood purity), as she taught that blood traitors, mudbloods, and Muggles were lesser than wizardkind. She was not highly intelligent, however, as she needed Filius Flitwick to let her into Ravenclaw Tower. However, she was seemingly slightly brighter than her brother Amycus[6].Â Like Bellatrix Lestrange, she admired Voldemort and detested \"blood traitors\", Muggle-borns and Muggles alike.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
