{"id": "Antonin_Dolohov", "name": "Antonin Dolohov", "fandom": "harrypotter", "url": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Antonin_Dolohov", "personality": ["Dolohov was extremely loyal to Lord Voldemort and was a merciless Death Eater willing to commit various atrocities without hesitation or regret. He showed no remorse about wounding sixteen-year-old Hermione Granger; in fact, he was grinning about it as he tried to persuade Harry Potter to hand over the prophecy they were fighting over. Dolohov was very proud when he defeated Alastor Moody in a duel, as Moody was a highly skilled wizard. Dolohov also displayed a highly arrogant and self-confident attitude and had developed a habit of engaging more than one opponent at a time or challenging powerful wizards such as the Prewett brothers, Moody, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Filius Flitwick.\n", "Dolohov was on friendly terms with his fellow Death Eaters, as he seemed to consider Yaxley and Thorfinn Rowle as close friends. When Voldemort spoke of how Charity Burbage supported Muggle rights and would permit breeding with them, Dolohov smiled in a confused fashion as if he literally thought that the idea of doing such a thing was disgusting, showing that he, like other Death Eaters, hated Muggles, Muggle-borns and most likely people who were half-bloods and blood traitors. Ironically, however, his master was in fact half-blood. It is not mentioned if Dolohov knew or not about Voldemort`s true blood status.\n"], "personality_quotes": [], "figure_captions": [], "quote": ["There was Antonin Dolohov. I — I saw him torture countless Muggles and — and non-supporters of the Dark Lord.", "—Dolohov's sadistic nature\n", "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"], "description": "Antonin Dolohov was a Dark wizard and one of the original Death Eaters of Lord Voldemort. Dolohov was a powerful wizard, and among all the Death Eaters, only Bellatrix Lestrange and Severus Snape could equal him in magical ability. He fought in the First Wizarding War, during which he tortured many Muggles, and wizards and witches who were not supporters of the Dark Lord. Along with four other Death Eaters, he participated in the murders of Fabian and Gideon Prewett. Dolohov was caught, convicted of these crimes, and sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban.\n"}
