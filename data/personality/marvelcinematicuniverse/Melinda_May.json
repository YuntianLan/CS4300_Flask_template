{"id": "Melinda_May", "name": "Melinda May", "fandom": "marvelcinematicuniverse", "url": "https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Melinda_May", "personality": ["Melinda May is a quiet person who was once described as \"warm\", \"fearless\" and unafraid to break rules. May was a veteran pilot and soldier until she was 'damaged' from an incident in Bahrain, where she had to kill an Inhuman child unable to control her powers; as May wanted children, this broke her. May was married to Dr. Andrew Garner, but she doesn't discuss her past with her teammates.[9] As part of Coulson's Team, May showed her joker side by using the classic \"whip cream\" gag on Leo Fitz, who thought it was one of the other four because May seemed less likely. \n", "May has an unwavering respect for Phil Coulson and follows his orders even when it conflicts with her desires, as when she yielded in her pursuit of Carl Creel. She was deeply hurt when she heard he had died. As her LMD later confirms, May holds affection for Coulson. \n", "May is fiercely protective of her teammates, going back into the field to protect Coulson despite having retired from field missions, taking up the Berserker Staff instead of Grant Ward, and going so far as attacking Ian Quinn after he shot Skye. She is very secretive and will often answer questions with a look, using few words or none at all. Despite her protectiveness of them, it took May a long time to bond with her team. Skye even claimed that she acted like a robot, as everything for her was just \"Target- acquired. Threat- eliminated.\"[8] Melinda May puts up a cold and stoic front but inside she is kind and selfless. She uses her own experiences to connect with other people.\n"], "quotes": [["\"She the type that holds a grudge?\"\"Savors it, actually.\"", "―Lance Hunter and Phil Coulson[src]"]], "figure_captions": []}
