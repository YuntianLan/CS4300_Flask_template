He developed this philosophy after his personal experiences and by studying ancient Sith documents.[5] Having witnessed the destruction of the Sith, Bane saw that their infighting and greed led to their downfall. In order to preserve the Sith as its last survivor, Bane adopted the Rule of Two,[4] believing that limiting the number of Sith to one Master and one apprentice would allow the Sith to survive in secret so they could plot their revenge against the Jedi.[3] Like his descendants, Bane inspired fear in the hearts of other beings.[12]\n"], "personality_quotes": [["\"I chose to pass my knowledge on to only one.\"", "―Darth Bane's specter — Listen (file info)[src]"]], "figure_captions": [], "quote": ["The Sith killed each other.

As the only surviving Sith, Bane recognized that Sith infighting had weakened them to the point that the Jedi could destroy them. To rectify this, Bane reformed the Sith and created the Rule of Two, mandating that there could be only two Sith—a Master and an apprentice—at any given time. These new Sith would begin a plot to destroy the Jedi in secret. With Bane's defeat, the Jedi wrongly believed that the Sith were defeated with him.\n"}
