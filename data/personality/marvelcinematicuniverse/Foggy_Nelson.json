Matt Murdock and Nelson have been best friends since college. Murdock appreciates that Nelson doesn't treat him like he's fragile and Nelson appreciates Murdock seeing him as an equal and hearing about the beautiful women entangled in Murdock's love life. The two friends were determined to start their own law firm and make a difference in Hell's Kitchen. Nevertheless, Nelson is the more pragmatic of the duo and thinks that they should take cases that actually pays the bills while Murdock wants to take cases that defend only the innocent.\n", "Nelson disapproves of Daredevil's vigilantism and thinks that justice should be done in court. Ultimately though, Nelson's priority is whatever is best for the people of Hell's Kitchen, to the point where he gave Murdock his Daredevil suit so that he could save the city once again.\n"], "quotes": [["\"You seem like a decent guy, Mr. Nelson.
