She was mainly seen by students as an obstacle to research,[3] but she was professional nonetheless, helping students to check out books and by finding information for them.[8] While she did not appear to be overtly fond of the students, she did not, unlike Argus Filch, appear to outright dislike them either, being strict but by no means demeaning or unpleasant, only getting genuinely angry when they failed to respect the sanctity of the school library by eating there, or by mistreating the books. Her protective nature of books did not just apply to the library's, as she looked deranged when she saw Harry's own textbook covered with self-written notes.[19] Likewise, she would not permit students eating in the library, and chased out anyone who violated this rule.[8]\n", "While stern bordering on the extreme, Irma was fully capable of appreciating students who did respect the rules, behaved prudently and showed an interest in learning and reading. When she overheard Jacob's sibling confide in his friends while visiting the library that the attack on James and Lily Potter was one of the reasons that Boggarts turned into Lord Voldemort, Madam Pince walked over and informed them that she remembered them fondly, and told how they often used to sit on a specific spot in the library to study together, before awarding them 20 points for helping to keep the memory of the Potters alive by talking about them.\n"], "personality_quotes": [["\" WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?\"", "—Pince catches students eating in the library[src]\n"]], "figure_captions": [], "quote": ["A warning: If you rip, tear, shred, bend, fold, deface, disfigure, smear, smudge, throw, drop, or in any other manner damage, mistreat, or show lack of respect towards this book, the consequences will be as awful as it is within my power to make them.", "—Pince's note in a library book\n", "Quidditch Through the Ages "], "description": "Madam Irma Pince (fl. 1971 – 1997) was a witch and librarian at the library of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
