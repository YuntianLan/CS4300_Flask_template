He intensely disliked humans, however, centaurs don't usually kill the young and the innocent and during the period where the centaurs had turned against Hagrid he allowed Hagrid to pass unscathed solely due to him being accompanied by their young. He was shown to be in favour of killing any human if they wandered into the centaurs' midst and insulted them.[2] However, his views of humanity might have changed after witnessing Harry's selfless actions and welcoming Firenze back into the herd.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
