{"id": "Andromeda_Tonks", "name": "Andromeda Tonks", "fandom": "harrypotter", "url": "https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Andromeda_Tonks", "personality": ["It is safe to assume, given her marriage to a Muggle-born, that Andromeda was very different from both of her sisters: while her sisters married into \"respectable\" pure-blood families, she married for love despite her family's opposition, leading to her family's hatred of her.\n", "She is clearly a good mother, as seen by her showing her concern about her daughter's whereabouts after the Battle of the Seven Potters and taking care of her during her pregnancy. She is also a good grandmother, as she raised her daughter's son after her death.\n", "Apart from her husband and daughter, her cousin Sirius Black considered her to be his only true family, demonstrating that Andromeda always treated Sirius with respect and kindness. In addition to being a good wife, mother, and grandmother, she is a good friend because, despite being under torture, she did not reveal anything that could harm Harry Potter or any of her friends. Like Molly Weasley, Andromeda is a woman dedicated to her family and friends. Thus, in many ways, Andromeda's personality contradicted the \"evil Slytherin\" stereotype held by many students of the other Houses. Instead, she appears to embody the Slytherin principle of fraternity, as seen by her standing by her friends, family, and allies.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
