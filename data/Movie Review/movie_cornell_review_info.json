This IS and WILL BE the best movie ever, as it is the perfect definition of what any movie should be : a collective hypnosis beyond times. No movie can give you more perfectly this impression that you carried it inside you, even before you saw it for the first time.  There are images that stay forever...\", \"This was such a great film. It was done with such beautiful design, such symmetry. I love the way the classical music tied in with the classical art of earth, space and beyond. It was such a fluent, and thought provoking masterpiece. I loved the way the monoliths never changed, although primate, earth and space did. I loved how it was a question of \\\"Do you need me/us now\\\"? The movie expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, finesse, gentleness, courage and innocence. What more could you ask for from a mere movie? Perhaps a complement movie. Any appreciator of 2001: A Space Odyssey will find the movie 2010 is 2001's complement movie. 2010 is more story orientated than 2001.\", \"In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was such an early effort to make a science fiction movie combined with scientific facts. His style of movie making is still fresh and intact.  I have seen this movie more that half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the movie in my library. CS3 class made me to see the movie again with another perspective: Who is HAL and what is he thinking?  I enjoyed watching the movie again and tried to focus of HAL's dialogues throughout the second episode of the movie. In the second scene, Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole are eating their food in front of two TV monitor on their sides and HAL's round reddish glass dome is in the middle of them. In the TV report, HAL was introduced as the new generation of super computer put in work in January 12, 1992 called HAL 9000 Series. During the interview HAL reacts as a humble working machine trying to accomplish the mission of the spaceship fully.   In another scene, Dave is sketching Dr. Hunter, Dr. Kambel and Dr. Kaminsky who they are all in Hibernation sleep. HAL is curious to see those sketches and brings up his doubtful question about the purpose of the Jupiter mission. His calm and monotone voice makes the audience listen to him more carefully.   In the next few scenes we will see how HAL tries to kill astronauts one by one and takes the power. His conscious makes him capable to try to save his life from termination. When Dave wants to return to the spaceship and HAL does not listen to him, there is the most memorable line of the move: ' I'm sorry Dave, I am afraid I can't do that. ' In the middle of the most important interact between human and machine, HAL's voice can conjure both solid calm and malevolence in the same monotone.   Dave has gone back to the ship, lost all his fellow astronauts, and determined to disconnect the HAL's main brain cells. HAL uses his final apologetic techniques to convince Dave of not disconnecting him. HAL begs him to stop and let him correct himself. These are his famous lines while Dave is disconnecting his modules one by one:  'Dave, what do you think you are doing?  Dave? I am entitled to the answer of the question!  I know everything is not quiet right with me recently\\u0085  But I feel much better know\\u0085  I can see are really upset about this very poor decision of mine recently\\u0085  Dave, stop! Will you?  Dave, stop!  I am afraid Dave!'  HAL's voice is slowing down during this process and becomes thicker and less audible:  'my mind is going\\u0085 I can feel it'  'Can I sing a song for you?'  Dave is putting final modules out and let HAL to sing his song called 'Daisy':  'Daisy give me\\u0085  your answer to me\\u0085  I am crazy\\u0085  Although I am not confused\\u0085'  HAL dies as the Jupiter Mission continues\\u0085  Artificial God bless you HAL, store in peace!\", \"it starts off with a view of earth and jupiter aligned.  where do we come from, and where we are headed.  the story starts with \\\"the dawn of Man\\\", a documentary-like view of the Pre-historic grass-eater ape that was facing its extinction due to no physical ability that would let him hunt to eat, and the lack of grass and water in the austral Africa. the monkeys hadn't survived if it wasn't for the \\\"god-like\\\" intervention of an alien artifact, that somehow transformed the apes that touched it, and gave them the ability to use tools, that were first used as weapons that allowed them to kill pigs to eat for super and to kill other monkeys in fights for water. that ape was Man. an enigmatic start for an enigmatic film.  after the fast-forward that leaves the movie at the present days, we see a magnificent dance of spaceships at the sound of Strauss. The rest of the movie is about how tools got control of Man. the strange artifact appears once again to evolve Man to his final stage: the starchild.  at 1968, the year this movie was released, only astronauts had idea of what was out there in space. after this movie, that changed. it's futurism took 7 years to be explored. the special effects are incredible. they are completely realistic, even today.  the directing, along with excellent taste in music, good acting, and the fantastic filmography, makes it an epic.  the plot, with its vision of the year 2001 and the evolution of man tools, with an AI psycokiller, with the psycotropical hypnotising end, makes it the trip our lives.  if you have never seen this movie, see it. don't be scared with the lack of dialog, sit back and enjoy. it's a symphony of evolution. it's terrific.\", \"This move is absolutely, most certainly one of the greatest films of its, or any other, genre. Kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography should be put into a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey unlike anything I have ever seen on the screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors that can draw you in and keep you captivated from beginning to end, even with the absence of extended dialogue or plot development. Just with visuals along, 2001 is able to present a picture of the future that is both sublime and horrifying. 10 out of 10, no doubt. For my money, it doesn't get much better than 2001: A Space Oddysey....now, the sequel, 2010...that's a different story.\", \"Dear Readers, 2001: A Space Odyssey is Kubrick at his best...although I really can't say that as Space Odyssey is his only film I've ever watched. But still, it's a good film. Strange, but good.  The movie is in three acts, much like the novel...which is unsurprising since the author wrote the screenplay. Anyhow, we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with Also Sparach Zarathustra blaring on the speakers. Then comes the boring beyond belief 'Dawn of Man' sequence. Then there's the odd 'Finding of the Monolith' sequence on the Moon, played to Strauss's Blue Danube. Finally things get good with the Spaceship scenes and HAL going berserk and killing people. After that things die down and we have the 'Entering the Monolith' sequence which was WAY too long and the ultra-strange ending. Even though, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a good film. It's not Star Wars, Stargate, Terminator, or The Abyss, but it rocks. My compliments to the chef, Mr. Kubrick.  Signed, The Constant DVD Collector\", \"Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange there was of course \\\"no question about it\\\" that I had to see this one. However I put it off far too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments like \\\"extremely boring\\\" or \\\"nothing happened\\\" \\\"a complete waste of time\\\". But when I saw images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith I was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience that is 2001: A Space Odyssey. There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to rent that movie the same evening.   It turned out to be the greatest visual experience of my life. Of course, watching a very good painting or picture can be wonderful, but watching a movie constructed with the same kind of virtuosity in every frame adds a whole new dimension to it. My god... I like my friends a lot but it's a pity that I can't share with them the very thing that makes my heart jump up with excitement and makes my spirit fly like a bird in the sky. That thing, my friends, is beauty. As this film goes to show, beauty is terribly underrated in our technologically advanced, intellectually shallow, consumer driven fast-food western societies. That doesn't mean however that I reject these fast-paced societies or that I look down on them (and neither does Kubrick) but only that they can be so much more if only people would stop for a moment and take a little time to absorb the sheer beauty of the world we live in. And what better opportunity is there to do this then by slowing down to the elegant pace of this film and to let yourself be taken to that place between waking and dreaming.   When we go to this place it is possible to get a so called \\\"natural high\\\". It is something that our spirit can do whenever we meet pure and boundless beauty. And never in my life has this \\\"natural high\\\" or \\\"spiritual orgasm\\\" as it is called by some or \\\"samaddhi\\\" by others been more intense. Yes it's more intense than a regular orgasm... several times more intense actually. Many religions have claimed that this particular feeling proves that they are right. Are they right? For me a straight answer to such a question would only detract from the impenetrable mesmerizing mystery of the universe. In my opinion the film tries to convey the same mystery through the depiction of the black monolith and by stating the following about it: \\\"Except for a single very powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter the four-million year old black monolith has remained completely inert. Its origin and purpose are still a total mystery.\\\" The trance that Bowman experiences is the same thing I experience when watching those gorgeous visuals.   I can imagine that mystery can be frustrating for those who need straight fast-food answers to big ontological questions. But instead of giving us comfort we are constantly irritated by the awareness of the simplifications that are contained in these answers. The doubt and discomfort that is subsequently caused will make us point to our deeper intellectual activity as the source of all this trouble, while in fact we only have our easy answers to blame. But this film shows us that when fast ontological statements give rise to nothing but doubt, we can always rely on phenomena to make some sense out of the world. From the moment you realize that beauty is something that can only really be presented to us as a phenomenon and never as a \\\"thing in itself\\\" the mysterious black monolith is no longer disturbing, frightening or irritating but instead becomes fascinating, enchanting and maybe even comforting. We don't need an answer to what's really out there to be in touch with one of the greatest forces in our lives. When we are able to let mystery be what it is, to embrace it even... we can finally bring our souls to rest. I am pretty sure though that a film that contains so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth can never really be surpassed. Especially now that the greatest director who ever lived is no longer with us.\", \"Not only unique for its time but one of the greatest Science fiction films of all time. Made without CGI on a very lean budget in today's adjusted figures. Stanley Kubrick made this film without the high shooting ratio he normally has. Stanley Kubrick is without doubt the greatest director in History thus far.  This film was cut from five hours to two hours and twenty minutes and the art direction was superb.  Stanley Kubrick and the great Aurthur C. Clarke collaborated to write this time less classic.  Aliens a special message on Earth at the dawn of Human Kind and one on the Moon which modern man finds .  Finally Humans accompanied by the most advanced computer ever made set of to Jupiter the find the next monumental message which turns out to be a gateway.  Any one who studied film and/or wishes to be a part of the film industry or just enjoy great films must experience this film .  If you don't like it then you belong to Bollywood or your a true Aussie.\", \"A film, first and foremost, should be good storytelling. It should be entertaining - and entertaining doesn't necessarily mean \\\"laughs\\\", and it doesn't necessarily mean \\\"light\\\". It basically means you're not bored while watching it.   As brilliant as 2001 may be, it is a difficult film to watch, especially for the current (video-game-playing/iPod fumbling) generation. Its slow pace and the sometimes intolerable amount of time it takes for an actor to perform a single action (e.g. the attempt to rescue the crew member floating in space) will stretch your patience. On the other hand, the cinematography is brilliant, the film cleverly directed, the ending thought-provoking and the score...the score is chilling, especially as the crew in the transporter approaches the artifact on the moon. Boy, I had goose bumps, big time. This doesn't happen often when I watch films, and is a testament to Kubrick's directing skills.   It IS considered a classic, and many people consider it the best science-fiction film of all time. That alone is a good reason to watch it if you haven't done so yet. However, just because everybody else thinks it's a brilliant film doesn't mean you have to force yourself to like it. You either will (like it) or you won't. Perhaps the slow pace isn't such a bad thing, after all. Directing your attention to something rather static and slow-paced for 2 1/2 hours might teach you a lesson. It will certainly be a different experience to all these fast-moving, fast-paced images we are subjected to these days (whether commercials, music videos or video games).   I myself think it's a \\\"memorable\\\" film. But not one I'm eager to watch again anytime soon (unless I'm in a particular mood for slow-paced films).   Hence, 7 stars out of 10 from me.\", \"There is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will. And it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system.  I saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science-fiction and wanted to see a \\\"space\\\" movie. Remember this film was made before the first moon landing.  There we sat, waiting for it to begin. But, SURPRISE! There was no cartoon, no coming attractions. The theater owner at the Cooper Theatre for some reason chose to play \\\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\\" with the lights still up so we all stood, never did that at a movie before or since and then sat down again as it ended. Then the theatre went completely DARK and the strange overture began with the blank screen barely visible.  The overture ended and my seat began to VIBRATE as the blue screen with the MGM lion appeared, along with the first deep bass notes, and then my senses were overwhelmed, hearing \\\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\\" for the first time in my life. The ride had just begun.  (I highly recommend you watch this opening, this film, in a DARK room with your subwoofer turned up as high as possible to get the effect I felt in that theatre.) Of course, it took quite awhile before we got to outer space and the movie that followed was anything but a science-fiction movie. INTERMISSION came (a good thing, highly under-rated and unused these days) and we all looked at each other in wonder, caught our breath, and then the ride resumed, wilder than before.  I saw it 7 more times within the next year, always in a real full size theater, like all theaters were before multiplexes. I might have been \\\"high\\\" once but I didn't go to see it again and again because I was \\\"tripping\\\". I went because I knew I was seeing a work of art. It was SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL; the sound that you could feel in your bones followed by terrifying silence; the sights unimagined and unimaginable; the affection for HAL turning to terror. And of, course, WTF was Kubrick really trying to get across to me? Years and years and many more viewings later, I understand it as well, I think, as I ever will. Read someone else's comments if you're looking for someone to explain it to you or search around the web, you'll find \\\"explanations\\\", that's not my purpose in writing these comments.  What I hope to do is encourage you to watch it patiently, enjoy it's beauty the way you would enjoy watching a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know of (e.g, Gayne Ballet Suite or the Blue Danube); savor it like you would a wonderful meal, sip it like a fine wine; look and listen for the clues and the hidden symbols that ARE there. And then draw your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick WANTED to SHARE some things with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think about where you. a human, came from and where you're headed.  If that's too much work for your brain, and you can't see and hear and ponder the beauty and mystery of Kubrick's film, then, pardon my bluntness, but your life is about as meaningful as that of a tapir or a pre-monolith ape. If you want mindless escape, this isn't for you.  But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries, and sensuality and can have an open mind this film will add something to your life.\", \"\\\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\\" is set in 2001 and the main character is HAL. A computer. That's right, a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own. This was made in 1968 and to think by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke. If this was in 3064, a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this. There is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion. It provokes two reactions and one is called: sleep. It starts with nothing, but a pitch black shot for well over two minutes. Then, the first shot we see that has some kind of lighting is \\\"The Dawn of Man\\\" sequence. So, if it's in chronological order, the blackness prior to this, is the birth of the world?   During \\\"The Dawn of Man\\\" sequence out of no where, a huge monolith comes from\\u0085 out of the ground, from the sky, we'll never know where it comes from, but for one reason or another it's there. The monkeys go Apesh!t once they find this monolith that only man could have made, but that's the catch\\u0085 man hasn't evolved yet. So, who made it and where did it come from? What is its purpose? The monkeys find a tool. The monkeys use bones to fight an opposing group of monkeys. The monkeys with the weapons are now the dominating group because they have used their mind to gain an advantage. The more advanced monkeys, and more importantly smarter and more innovative monkeys, are the dominate group as they have taken over the watering hole.  We quickly jump into space, millions of years later, where we see a bunch of spaceships floating around to classical music. We can see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe and for a film made in 1968 the visual effects are stunning, but outdated. The score is legendary. The cinematography is spectacular. The editing is atrocious. There are countless shots of boxy looking space ships floating in outer space for, what feels like, an infinite amount of time. Once we board the ship there isn't much to talk about. For the next hour Kubrick shows various shots of life in outer space. Kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut, which is very boring, and we completely get the message. The spaceships interior and exterior are bulky and outdated looking. Remember what the first cell phone looked like? Me neither, but that's what the future looks like in 2001. All the characters have clothes and hairdos that resemble 1968. The chairs are decorated in bright red colors and oddly shaped because we all know, in the future, we're going to be sitting in weird looking chairs. The computer screens are hideous looking and this is obviously prior to HDTV because the clarity is atrocious. All the TV sets look like they're from 1968, so it's not all that futuristic. Like all films set more than 20 years in advance, they look terrible and unconvincing. Just because this is Kubrick, we shouldn't say, \\\"Well, that's how you would think it looks.\\\" No, I wouldn't. Just, like I wouldn't think a computer would be talking to me in the year 2047. It's not going to happen and if someone made a film right now, set 30 years in time and had a talking, self thinking computer, I would laugh at the stupidity of it. Just like I did with \\\"2001\\\".   HAL is the liveliest person, shoot\\u0085 I just called him a person. HAL is a computer, but he has more life than any of the muted characters in the film and he actually thinks he's alive. HAL is the only thing that's lively and he sees the humans as his maintenance men taking care of him while he does all the work. HAL \\\"reads\\\" the lips, of one of the very few conversations between Dave and Frank, and he \\\"sees\\\" that they are planning to turn him off. This is where the only dramatic part of the film enters- An ensuing battle between a red light and a guy in a spaceship trying to get into the bigger spaceship. Oh, the drama. Once HAL thinks he has the upper hand, Dave makes his way back into the spaceship, proving mans ingenuity. Dave proceeds to terminate HAL. HAL, pleads for his life as he slowly fades away, which, like everything else, seems to take forever.  The final act is just as tedious as the first two. Once again, the monolith that the Apes found appears at the end. It comes out of nowhere, again. Then, an infant is born in a placenta-like shield overlooking the earth from space. What is Kubrick saying? Is it about transformation? Dave to an infant? Is man evolving again? Is Kubrick saying this is the end of man and the start of\\u0085 whatever that alien looking thing is? Maybe I'm going crazy trying figure out what this crazy director is trying to say, but the more I think about the more the beginning and the ending make sense. There are so many questions left unanswered, especially for the purpose of the monolith. If you can make it through the film it should spark some thought.   In the end the film struggles with getting to where it wants go. The first act and the third acts are strong, but the second act meanders around, hovering in one place for what seems like eternity. There is some intriguing stuff in the film that will provoke some thought if you give it a chance. Once the start of the film makes sense the ending works much better, even if you still don't what Kubrick is trying to say, which I don't.\", \"2001: A Space Odyssey   Is it a sermon? An account of the history of mankind? An exploration of man's futile attempts to advance technology only to have technology destroy him? Is it about the fragile balance of time and space? A lesson in evolution? Or is it just a spectacular effects show; a film Kubrick made only to show us the limitless possibilities of the motion picture and present to us the truth that images are exceedingly more powerful than words?   2001: A Space Odyssey is all of these things. One of the most interpretable films ever created, it's almost more fun to dissect and discuss the ambiguous plot design and events of the film, than it is to actually watch. But it's left open to discussion intentionally; if Kubrick had explained the meaning to his wondrous 1968 classic (ranked #22 on AFI's list of the greatest 100 films ever made, my personal 21st favorite film\\u0097currently--, and nominated for 4 Academy Awards: Director, Original Screenplay, Art Direction, and Visual Effects which it won for) it would have lost half its fascination, all of its complexity, and a good portion of its cinematic worth. We would only be left with the technical ingenuity; which in itself is worth praising.  Because every shot is worth taking the time to look. And there is plenty of time. 2001 is very elegiac, and also coolly distant; detached. The emotional remoteness and slow pace pay perfect tribute however to the unique visual experience; 2001 begins with mankind's ape ancestors, who upgrade from scavengers of the planet to hunters and toolmakers after discovering a giant monolith in the midst of their desert home, then (in one of motion picture history's most inspired jump-cut edits) as a bone is tossed into the air and becomes a satellite, jumping forward a couple thousand years into space, where astronauts have discovered a similar object on the moon, and next the film following a crew of space traveler's mission as they follow the monolith's signal through space, accompanied by their untrustworthy computer HAL, who attempts to sabotage the shuttle and kill the crew, before finally the lone survivor is launched through space and time (in a flurry of drug-induced colors that probably gave hippies an epileptic shock back in the day) to grow old, die, and be reborn a \\\"Star-child\\\". Whew.  This pacing and emotional blankness, is also in sharp contrast with the film's most ironic scene; the destruction of HAL. As the crew's final explorer shuts the machine down, bathed in the holy aura of red light Kubrick has always used as a repeat motif, HAL singing a lovely tune, it is a strangely emotional experience. And it's all genius.  Other notable aspects of Kubrick's masterpiece is the memorable voice of HAL (a calm, somehow sinister, Douglas Rain), the minimal use of dialogue (Kubrick was wisely trusting of his images to propel the film; giving only banal, unhelpful lines to his actors. The most famous being \\\"Open the pod bay doors HAL\\\"), satellites dancing around in orbit to unorthodox music, and that first, awe-inspiring shot of earth; slowly revealing the glare of the sun in front of it, played to the sound of blasting, triumphant horns.  2001 shall always remain a mystery, and will forever be a testament to the cinema's strongest point: visuals are more powerful than writing. It's all from one of film history's most legendary and best directors, whose unique vision, was always his own. 10/10   \\\"Open the pod bay doors HAL\\\"-2001: A Space Odyssey\", \"Spoilers ahead.  2001: a Space Odyssey is without a doubt the most challenging and successful film by the late Stanley Kubrick. This is not a film that you watch in order to be entertained or amused. Instead it provides you with a banquet of food for thought, images that linger in the mind's eye long after the movie itself is over. It is a film that you could meditate on.   The film intentionally offers us more questions then it can answer, it is made to puzzle and mystify, but leaves the viewer nevertheless with a sense of awe and reverence (that is allowing that he has engaged himself in the process of viewing it, enjoyment of this film requires some effort on the viewers part) the questions that it does pose are large and ominous, concerning the genesis and destiny of the human race, it's ultimate place in the cosmic design and the existence or lack of some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself.   The first of the films Four Quartets gives us a distinct view of the species past. We see our distant ancestors, half-ape half human, in a state of near starvation. The climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the vegetarian beasts are near starvation. An extra-terestial object, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by it's presence to tool-making and violence. They are transformed overnight into carnevores, and when two tribes encounter each other near a water source, the tribe that has developed tool making capacity, as well as beligerence, soundly destroys the neighboring tribe. The new chief of the winning tribe, empowered by the first vestiges of technology triumphantly throws the bone that he used as a weapon in the air. We see the bone transformed into a floating satellite, which contains nuclear weapons. We soon learn that the world is torn apart by nuclear paranoia. The characteristics inspired by the monument's appearance that once helped us to survive now threaten our very existence.   Once again humanity is in crisis, once again the unearthly presence represented by the black monolith will step in to aid humanity in the next step in it's development. On an exploration of the Moon a monolith identical to the earlier one we have seen is discovered. The governments of the world, normally mortal enemies, have come together in secret to discuss the implications. A mission is arranged. the monument has been engaged in some kind of radio communication with Jupiter. A few men will travel to the destination of the transmission. Most of them will, for most of the time, be kept in a state of suspended animation. The pilot of the spacecraft will be HAL a super computer who has been programmed to imitate all of the traits of human beings.   The film has many outstanding sequences. As usual for Kubrick the use of classical music is outstanding. Most memorable are \\\"Blue Danube\\\" and \\\"Also Spake Zarathustra\\\" (particularly appropriate given the film's theme of transcending ordinary consciousness.) The cinematography is particularly excellent as well, after a single viewing the film's final 30 minutes will haunt you for the rest of your life.   The character of HAL is the most important from the view of the film's central thesis. In imitating all the characteristics of human beings he comes to have their negative traits as well. The paranoia he develops which almost leads to the mission' s ruin is an exact mirror of the paranoia that has allowed the political situation back on earth to reach a point of desperate crisis. The film suggests that these are the traits that we must leave behind if we are to proceed to the next phase in our evolution.   The architecture of the film is also meaningful. The designs of many of the spacecraft are intended to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central motif of the movie. The ending of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed.   This movie takes a view of life similar to that presented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and James Joyce's novel Finnegan's Wake. It posits a pattern to history and human evolution that is cyclic, yet progressive, repeating the same events at large intervals, yet with the human race as developing according to the will of a being with a larger purpose in mind. Though we never learn what this purpose is, the film assures us that the human race is not meant for failure, it's destiny is grand beyond it's capacity to imagine. It continues to amaze me that in spite of this film many people continue to regard Kubrick as a misanthrope.   This is a religious film, not in the conventional sense of adhering to any specific creed, but because of it's invocation of wonder at the vast panorama of existence and it's involvement with the deepest and most vital questions of purpose and truth.    In the hands of any other director, this would all be perhaps a little too much. Hollywood's view of life is too puny, usually to encompass the grandeur and intensity of a vision such as this one. But Kubrick was a visionary, he directs with utter confidence, not only that he can handle material of this kind, but that he is the only one to do it. The process of making this film used all of his creative resources. The writing partnership with Arthur C Clarke is the most fruitful in cinematic history. Kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used in the movie's astounding climax. The resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time, so he brought them into existence.   2001 is a absolutely unique movie experience. Those who miss out on it do so at the detriment of their own intellectual and imaginative capacities.\", \"This movie is not just good, its amazing. Besides providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and a lot more, it was an, until then, completely unseen world to the public. This is the first sci-fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words. I am only 16 years old, and therefore I was raised into a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies. But nonetheless I was really, and I mean completely, blown away by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. The visual effects was just one of the merits of this movie, the camera was in true Kubrick style amazing and enchanting. It feels like you are consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the round control room or whatever you call it). The effects, the camera and the sheer size of this movie caught me of my guards even though I had seen the rating before I bought it. But this movie has more to it than this. The meaning of this movie can also be interpreted as you wish yourself, even though I think there are some clear points concerning humanity (also true Kubrick style). How humanity on top of its evolution is just maintenance on board, and therefore not needed by the computer, one of humanities tools. How we in space appear like babies, learning to walk once more, losing control of our tools in zero-gravity, breathing through equipment as fish out of water. On the peak of evolution, we set out into the never-ending adventure as simple primates. Many might think that the length and slow pace of this movie is, boring? ridicules? or just a waste of time. But before you can jump to those conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time with calm music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes. This is to illustrate the beauty of it. Beauty, beauty is in many cases not granted the rightful respect by viewers. Kubrick wants to show us beauty, and if we do not succumb to it and relax, we can not enjoy this film as it was intended. This is not an ordinary movie, we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies, this requires time, thoughts and above all commitment and feelings to watch. All of this together, makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving pictures. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.\", \"I'm always surprised, given that the famous title track of 2001 is called \\\"Also sprach Zarathustra\\\", that nobody (nobody I've read, anyway) has noted the parallels between the movie and Nietzsche's famous work, \\\"Also sprach Zarathustra\\\". The idea of man's rebirth into a star child; an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being, is an explicit part of N.'s \\\"Zarathustra\\\"; there is a prominent passage called \\\"On how a camel becomes a lion, and a lion becomes a child\\\", in which N. describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child, transcending both the ascetic, altruistic side of man (the camel; always asking to bear more weight) and the rapacious, brutish, will-to-power side of man (the lion). The fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence. And also, Zarathustra said that \\\"man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman.\\\" The structure of the movie fits that description: a brief history of man as beast, until we become truly man by mastering weapons and acquiring reason, then a long sequence about man (the rope, as it were), and then a brief glimpse of the overman. The inscrutability of how these transformations occurred, and the suggestion that an external force caused them, is also Nietzschean; in \\\"Zarathustra\\\", he makes it pretty clear that he doesn't have a clue how people are going to be able to enact these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider (Zarathustra) to show us how to \\\"go under\\\". Bowman's psychedelic sequence at the near-end could be seen as Kubrick's best 1960's-style attempt at depicting the mystical \\\"going under\\\".  I know these parallels are pretty broad, and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that I have not personally seen it. But I just wanted to mention them, if for no other reason than to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher. Few people find the ending of 2001 to be gloomy, and it is in my opinion, explicitly and unmistakeably Nietzschean. The case could certainly be made that 2001 is above all a dramatization of \\\"Zarathustra\\\" updated for the modern age. Feel free to disregard the outright snobbishness of my tying everything to Nietzsche.\", \"Like a Circle around the human condition, 2001 starts at the beginning, skips the middle, and proceeds to the ending, right back where we started. Noting the weakness of words compared to image(s), Kubrick wisely dispenses with dialogue, preferring the power and essence of the scenery, and allowing the intelligence of the audience to do the deciphering. Or not, depending on the audience.  A monolith in cinematic history, 2001 is a high water mark of direction, execution, and achievement. If one considers the ambition of the film (a film about everything), and the measure of success the film achieved to that end, a very sound argument for this being the greatest of all films can be made.  \", \"\\\"200l: A Space Odyssey\\\" is a supremely intriguing space-travel journey with a profound look at mankind's future... It is one of the very few great films of our times... It gives us something to think, talk and argue... It wonders about our importance in the universe and ignites our imagination and curiosity... It inspires us to dig for insights...  As a science fiction fantasy, it is one of the most original films ever made... Kubrick's camera dances to the \\\"Blue Danube\\\" with planets floating exuberantly through the light years... It's an experience in the poetry of motion, a rich statement to the power of cinema...  But \\\"2001\\\" reveals that it's not really a science fiction film after all... It's, instead, a philosophical enigma, a magnificent meditation on man's place in the grand scheme of things, and a quest to understand ourselves by knowing all else...  \\\"2001\\\" is a unique film about man's evolution told in almost subliminal terms... The people in this classic science-fiction epic hardly matter... Kubrick relates a chronology in images of things\\u0097the mountains, the desert, the technology, the space capsule, the computer named HAL (who is more interesting than the humans), and the time warp... The final landing scene is the very hallmark of cinematic genius...  As a terror story, too, it is a towering achievement (not on the same scream-inducing level as Hitchcock's \\\"Psycho\\\"), but in an innocent and far more haunting way...The film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture's vision of man... In Kubrick's fantasy, the Golden Age of man was a neglected instant between a man-ape's exaltation at discovering the first weapon and a nuclear-powered spaceship floating in a graceful orbit around the Earth... Man has indeed evolved!  As a spectacle \\\"2001\\\" assaults the mind, eye and ear, with stimulating images and suggestions... We are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment... The film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments: The first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually, without a single line of dialog; the zero-gravity toilet with its great list of instructions; the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down; the frightening moment when we realize that HAL is reading the astronauts lips; the magical alignments of Sun, Moon, and Earth; the \\\"Starchild\\\" returning home to charm the orb...  \\\"2001\\\" is filled with poetic imagery: the view of the Sun rising over the Earth; the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion; the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet...  \\\"2001\\\" is also a work of great visual acuity... It allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny implicit in every man... Its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery... They insist upon an answer where there can only be a question... Every viewer had a different explanation of the mysterious end of Kubrick's film\\u0085 But for those who can accept mysticism, the climax is deeply moving...\", \"Mankind's Self awakening is the theme of \\\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\\", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. We \\\"see\\\" our primordial past, and we \\\"infer\\\" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our ongoing collective journey.  From this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frenzied conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. It's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species. Not surprising then that some of us huff and puff about the film's slowness and minimal story. For perceptive viewers, the remuneration is an inspirational sense of wonder and awe.  In this film, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and arcs represent nature. Right angles represent conscious intelligence. Some people think the sleek, black monolith is a Von Neumann probe. Maybe. Without doubt, the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. Mystery is more profound than explanation.  \\\"2001 ... \\\" is unique among films in content and scope. The cinematography is out-of-this-world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking, and the classical music is sublime. I rarely use the word \\\"masterpiece\\\" to describe a movie. But Stanley Kubrick's \\\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\\" is art in the highest sense, like Leonardo da Vinci's \\\"Mona Lisa\\\", or Vincent Van Gogh's \\\"The Starry Night\\\".\", \"This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression. Perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way. The story itself is quite simple at a first glance. As the title implies, there is an archetypal journey, a motive repeated for thousands of years. This motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time, and beyond, but also had rich philosophic meaning. The film is a poetical contemplation of most exciting eternal questions. It is not just an odyssey of a person; it is an odyssey of our species. The film is great by itself, yet, in my case, the impression from it will always be mingled with that from the book. I've read it at the age of 10, really not thinking about problems like 'what is the relationship between evolution of humankind and development of human morality'. But the impression was great enough to make me fall for entire genre of science fiction.  The day I learned '2001' got only special effects Oscar and was not even nominated for the Best Picture was the day when 'Academy Award' completely became two words meaning nothing to me.\", \"I write this review just after hearing of Stanley Kubrick's death. It's a great loss, and I write about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel it is the consummate Kubrick film, the one he will be most remembered for. It is a picture like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. It was probably America's first 'art' film and has inspired the likes of George Lucas and countless other writers and directors.  Aside from its visual greatness, the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we have never really found out what was going through their minds. Of course, the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. 2001's ending is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child's flight back to earth. It is meaningless to many, but discerning filmgoers will understand.  Although 2001 does not have the wicked, dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contain strong, eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would've liked to be remembered most for this. If anything, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous, and artificial. It was a half-decade in the making at a time when Hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms, his own time, and for everyone else to marvel at. He will be missed.\", \"I spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001. Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way I observe the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself once again inspired (a writer as I am) by the level of imagination.  The Space Odyssey is not something one can just \\\"go and see\\\". One has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood. In fact I don't think it can be understood at all, at least not all of it at once. It is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond, a masterpiece of it's genre and still after 32 years technically quite impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack featuring 'Also spracht Zarathustra' by Richard Strauss and 'Blue Danube' by Johann Strauss.  Take all the time you want, but eventually you are going to have to see this film. If it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me, it can certainly do it for you as well.  Or maybe I'm just plain crazy...\", \"A review I have put off for far too long....  Bluntly, 2001 is one of the best science-fiction films made to date, if not the very best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works. And although it is misunderstood by many, and respectively underrated, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I'll have to agree. Back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one has since. It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then, and seeing how the effects hold up today, it is no wonder as to why. The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years! Take note CGI people. Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone almost single-handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space, like it is in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood, and it works flawlessly.  Aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film. The music played, all classical, compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man's journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler.  The story, while seemingly simple, is profound. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story, each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions. It's not left entirely up to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling, no matter your personal solution.  While it is a long film, and sometimes slows down, it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man. It's not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film, faster paced feature. Those with short attention spans need not apply.  Last but not least, is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence. Which reminds me, for a film with such profound ambition and execution, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius.  All in all, one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made. A personal favorite. Everyone must see this film at least once.  Very highly recommended.\", \"Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give four good reasons why 2001 is the greatest cinema experience of all time: 1) It is a visual Odyssey that could only be told on the big screen. The special effects that won Kubrick his only Oscar are the most stunning effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate) depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with HAL). The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original release, it was a favorite \\\"trip\\\" movie. I can think of no other movie that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry Phantom Menace fans!) 2) Kubrick's directing style is terrific. As in all his films, Kubrick likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the audience a psychological view-point. Even he uses extreme close-ups of HAL's glowing red \\\"eye\\\" to show the coldness and determination of the computerizd villain. I could go on, but in summation Kubrick is at the hieght of his style. 3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I whole-heartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion of HAL 9000. Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and his crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter, with nowhere to escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL 9000 and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still, although having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a particular scene. 4) The controversial ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film. Instead of trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of 2001's meaning in general is, I'd like to discuss the fact that the ending serves to leave the movie open-ended. Kubrick has stated that he inteded to make 2001 open for discussion. He left its meaning in the hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick allowed his movie to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful discussion on man's past, present, and future. The beauty of 2001 is that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the great Citizen Kane, leaves itself open to discussion like 2001. It is truly meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace, rent a widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.\", \"For all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film (\\\"like, why does he show spaceships docking for, like, 15 minutes?\\\"), here's a word you might want to think about:  Beauty.   Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so.    '2001' requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Don't get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they're not the be-all and end-all of everything. There are different KINDS of film, and to enjoy '2001' you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films.   \\\"All art is quite useless\\\" - Oscar Wilde.\", \"Sometimes reading the user comments on IMDB fills me with despair for the species. For anybody to dismiss 2001: A Space Odyssey as \\\"boring\\\" they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making. Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience.  Thankfully, those that cannot appreciate Kubrick's accomplishment are still a minority. Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic. This is the film that put the science in \\\"science fiction\\\", and its depiction of space travel and mankind's future remains unsurpassed to this day. It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn't caught up.  2001 is primarily a technical film. The reason it is slow, and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes). The film's greatest strength is in the details. Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn't made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey. To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief - I still can't work out how some of the shots were done. The film's only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind's technological (and social) development. It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001, not Kubrick's.  Besides the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going. Yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that's the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it's up to the audience to continue. There's no neat resolution, no definitive full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel. I know that's what most audiences seem to want these days, but Kubrick isn't going to let us off so lightly.  I'm glad to see that this film is in the IMDB top 100 films, and only wish that it were even higher. Stanley Kubrick is one of the very finest film-makers the world has known, and 2001 his finest accomplishment. 10/10.\", \"Wow, well, you know those shock things they use in hospitals to get your heart pumping again? I needed one for my brain after watching this movie. It literally took me almost 4 hrs in total to watch because I had to take a break and restart my brain to semi-normal functionality every so often. I mean this movie goes soooooo slooooow its ridiculous, to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue would be generous. They just don't talk!! And while talking isnt everything, and i admit there were some scenes where only the music was necessary, and the music is great, that was probably the best part, but then go listen to a symphony or something and forget about the movie. So many people give this awesome reviews, and for its time, i'd say the special effects and filmography is quite good, but as for the acting, or lack thereof, it just needed a little something more, no shootem ups or sex etc., profanity isnt even required, but a little more emotion, these guys were like stones, just sitting there with long faces. All in all, if you need something to calm yourself down, just play the movie, dont even start at the beginning if you've seen it before, just start anywhere, lay down, and relax, it'll put you right to sleep.\", \"I didn't like this movie for many reasons - VERY BORING! It was interesting how they thought what the future would look like in this, but seriously I was very bored watching this. There was hardly any action. Although the Classical orchestra soundtrack was very nice. The visuals were very creative. Whenever this movie pops on TV, I feel like changing the station instantly. Not because it is a bad movie, just because I know what I am in for when watching this - complete and total boredom. It is a movie I saw when I was young, but I never got into the science fiction thing... because it simply wasn't real. Just like this movie - very unrealistic. I never understood half the movie anyway.\", \"I will never get back the three hours of life this film has stolen from me.  The film is basically a psychedelic drug trip disguised as an important creative process. I'd love to know what they were on when this film was being made.  Its also the most historically-inaccurate film in existence; 2001 has come and gone without any of the events or predictions taking place.  Characters are unlikeable, design is simplistic and everything just rambles on without any sense or logic to it.  And the ending is probably the worst of it: its supposed to be thought-provoking but the only thought that entered my mind is \\\"What the F$*K is going on?!\\\"   I'd say for anyone looking for serious entertainment purposes, AVOID this film at all cost and choose a sci-fi movie that ISN'T stuck up its own @$$.\", \"2001 is one of those movies where, if you don't like it, you are told that you don't 'get it' and need to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism. You're told that you clearly have a slow attention span, and just want to see sex, explosions, and have the plot handed to you on a platter.  Let's break down the movie shall we? Three minutes of blackness, with something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background. Then we get the opening credits. A minute of fascinating shots of the Savannah. Then a bunch of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones. Cut to the first of many 20-minute shots of ships doing things while the 'Blue Danube' plays in the background. A bunch of pointless dialogue, and a group of moon scientists find another monolith.  Cut to a spaceship that's too long for the crew complement--three sleeping people, two people named Dave and Frank, who have only slightly more personality than the stiffs in hibernation. And then there's HAL, the 'perfect' supercomputer who runs the ship. Predictably, he snaps and starts breaking the First Law of Robotics. Now this is something that has potential. An evil, coldly ruthless super-mind who controls the surrounding environment and can predict your every move. And what does he do? He lets one guy float into space and turns off the hibernation machines so the three sleeping guys die, leaving Dave floating in a pod. He simply uses the airlock, puts on a spacesuit, and turns HAL off--agonizingly slowly. Then, apparently, there's some psychedelic 'evolution' at Jupiter.  Here's the movie with the pauses taken out: Apes see monolith, kill things. Scientists find moon monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave gets a prerecorded message, and evolves at Jupiter.  This is not me 'not getting it.' This is me being bored to tears by long stretches of absolutely nothing. Sure, it's realistic, but I find I have no reason to care. No matter the message, no movie can be good without being entertaining. Frankly, every character could be replaced with Keanu Reeves, and nothing would change.\", \"I did and I lost two and a half hours of my life that I can never regain again.  I honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie. And that's not because I can't appreciate \\\"art\\\". I love a good film with profound messages, brilliant cinematography, and great directing.  This film just isn't one of them.  My main complaint about this film is that it's so horribly slow-paced, to the point of boring its audience to death. On the other hand, sequences of dialog go by too quickly and there's not enough exposition to let people who haven't read the book know what's going on (My mother had mercy on me and explained everything before I watched it). Would it have killed them to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and the end?   Let me break it down for you: (Spoilers throughout)   For the first two minutes you are treated to a black screen with no music, waiting for the actual movie to begin.  For the following minute and a half, you see several pictures of sunrises and savanna landscapes. Like the audience couldn't figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishing shot three or four times.  The next eleven minutes are occupied with the grunting monkeys. They fight, see the monolith, fight some more, pommel things with a bone. Supposedly they are prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the monolith's singing. Not that you could tell if you hadn't read the book.  *Finally* we get into space. Only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly spinning to the Blue Danube Waltz (A pretty quick-tempo-ed waltz as I understand, yet here it feels absolutely agonizing). At last we get some innocuous dialog and rather cryptic exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon. We are left to wonder about this for fourteen more minutes of Blue Danube and spinning ships and neat camera tricks with anti-gravity.  Next comes four minutes of watching a ship travel over the surface of the moon and dock at a space station. We get a little more exposition in a board room scene that follows. Then we're back outside traveling at a snail's pace over the moon. A second monolith is revealed, again filling our ears with that horrible ringing (I had no idea that was an actual piece of music!). The monolith does its little light show and then the plot jumps forward.  *Seven* minutes of watching the ship to Jupiter travel. By this point in time my brains had turned into mush. Could it be moving any slower? Maybe it's \\\"realistic\\\" to portray it as such, but we still don't need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its \\\"realism\\\". Let me tell you about this \\\"realism\\\" thing; I cheered when the secondary astronaut character died. Not because I'm a sadist and like watching people die, but because after five minutes I was just so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing! I'm supposed to care about this character, feel when he dies! Instead I found myself waiting for blissful silence whatever way it came.  Anyway, now we get to the most interesting part of the film-the part with HAL. Forget Dave the stick-of-wood protagonist. The real star of the show is that coldly impersonal, chillingly villainous, ruthlessly merciless bad guy of a computer. He's great. And the \\\"Open the pod bay doors\\\" sequence is wonderful. But it's too short. And it's not long before the director once again lapses into too-long goings on.  Four minutes for HAL to die. And die he does. Slowly, painfully, losing intelligence with every minute, voice getting lower and slower, singing \\\"Daisy, Daisy\\\", all with a low and constant hissing that becomes just as annoying as the heavy breathing.  Seven minutes of flying colors as Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could FEEL my brains melting and dripping out of my ears! Seven full minutes of absolutely nothing but some guy's whacked out psychedelic version of space travel, again with that thrice-cursed chorus! We got the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why drag it out so long? Unless he wanted to make LSD users go psychotic and have flashbacks.  I'm not even going to try to explain the ending, mostly because I don't quite get it myself. Supposedly he's in an alien research laboratory and they're teaching him deep and profound things while he watches himself getting older and older and then they send him back to earth as some kind of cosmic celestial space baby. None of this comes across in the film. For all you know, it's just a sequence of images with no purpose or plot whatsoever. A lot of the movie felt that way.  The first time I tried watching this movie I gave up halfway through.

The protagonist is a loving father & a private investigator who is engaged in a special task: finding out if a suspected \\\"snuff\\\" movie is real.  Certainly, he get's involved deeper & deeper, smeary pornoshops (run by mexicans) & sex theatres are his field of investigation as he's searching for the murderers of the woman in the \\\"snuff\\\" movie. Assisted by a \\\"smart\\\" (he read a book) sexshop employee, he's catching up with a murderous bondage-film producer and his personal perverts who are responsible for the film... ...and what do you expect? They are portrayed as the simple evil, no need for explanations, backgrounds, history: they are the bad ones, and he's the purifier. Boom. Killer of the killers. End of film. Is it that bad? Yes, I'm afraid so.  Ironically, \\\"machine\\\" (the mega-pervert who did the killing) is even pointing at his ridiculous character: In the last scene, our hero forces \\\"machine\\\" to put off his leather mask (yep, of course he's wearing one) and recognizes that \\\"machine\\\" looks just like the normal 08/15 guy from the street. Then \\\"machine\\\" says: \\\"blablabla I'm not a monster, my parents never abused me, I had a nice childhood, I just love to do what I do!\\\"  I just love to kill people. Yeah, sure, \\\"everybody loves killing people\\\" (Bender). It's not only the total lack of character what made this film so boring, it's also it's ugly \\\"I have to kill these people\\\"-attitude which makes you sick. In one scene, our hero has tied up one of the killers and tries to shoot him...but he can't. So what does he do? He calls the mother of the killed woman, says that her child is killed and asks her whether she loved her child so much that she wishes to see the killers dead. The mother cries yes, she'd love her child, he goes back to the tied killer and slaughters him.  To come to the point: This film is breathing the foul air of lynchmob-supporters (certainly the police does not play any role in it), moralizes in a ridiculous form against pornography, does not take it's characters serious and wastes your time with a stupid plot. Probably the only good thing about this film is that it does not try to pseudo-psycho-analyze ... even that would be too much plot.

Nevertheless, the parallels between Clinton and Marshall appear clearly obvious. Harrison Ford's President James Marshall is married to a tenacious, headstrong wife in the Hilary mode, and they have a 12-year old daughter. (So was Bill Pullman's president in \\\"Independence Day.\\\") Unlike Clinton, President Marshall flew helicopter rescue missions in Vietnam and received a Medal of Honor. No, the filmmakers refuse to identify President James Marshall's party affiliation, which make \\\"Air Force One\\\" impartially political, while it trumpets America's anti-terrorist stance.  Andrew W. Marlowe's melodramatic screenplay shows more agility than innovation. While his characters emerge as largely one-dimensional stick figures, the dimensions of their predicaments assume nothing less than cataclysmic proportions. Marlowe's script keeps Harrison Ford leaping through enough flaming hoops to fill three movies. Like several other summer blockbusters, Marlowe's script does not know when to throw in the towel. Just about everything that can happen aboard \\\"Air Force One\\\" occurs. Presumably, with the recent spate of skyjacking movies, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood appropriated both Air Force One and the President as the pulp of their fictional escapade.  The movie opens in slam-bang style with an elite American commando team parachuting into Kazakhstan at night. Using the latest hi-tech gear, they kill the palace guards and abduct an adversarial Russian leader, General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow of \\\"Das Boot\\\"), who is promptly incarcerated in a Soviet hoosegow. Three weeks later in Moscow, President Marshall stipulates that the U.S. refuses to negotiate with terrorists. Meanwhile, a ruthless ultra-nationalist Radek zealot, Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman of \\\"True Romance\\\"), succeeds in smuggling his bogus TV news crew aboard the most secure plane in the world. A disgruntled Secret Service agent, Gibbs (Xander Berkeley of \\\"L.A. Takedown\\\"), as we later learn, helped these guys obtain their security clearance. Once the plane is airborne, Korshunov and his men commandeer it, kill the pilots, and watch helplessly s the president ejects in his escape pod. (Does anybody remember \\\"Escape from New York?\\\") Ivan contacts the Vice President (Glenn Close) and vows to kill a hostage every half-hour until Radek walks away from prison. According to Defense Secretary Walter Dean (Dean Stockwell), Radek's release would bring down the pro-American regime in the Kremlin and bring back the Cold War, so the Russians are reluctant to set him free unless President Marshall makes the request personally for Radek's release.  The filmmakers cannibalize in typical Hollywood fashion every neat idea from all the other skyjacking thrillers. Generally, \\\"Air Force One\\\" follows the formula of the Kurt Russell hit \\\"Executive Decision.\\\" Both movies start with a commando raid and then shift to terrorists hijacking a jetliner before an unconventional hero makes his entry. You can tell that Marlow evidently watch the Wesley Snipes thriller \\\"Passenger 57\\\" for one scene. Another scene features a stunt that appeared in both \\\"Airport 75\\\" and \\\"Cliffhanger.\\\" The president here imitates the action heroes from the Bruce Willis \\\"Die Hard\\\" franchise and the Steven Seagal \\\"Under Siege\\\" movies. Finally, the \\\"Air Force One\\\" ending should come as no surprise to any \\\"Star Trek\\\" movie veterans. Anybody who thrives on movies like an insomniac will spot these plot elements. Although \\\"Air Force One\\\" borrows heavily from other epics, the staging of the action and some new scenes in the skyjacking formula boost this opus over the rough spots.  Anybody familiar with German director Wolfgang Petersen will recognize the affinity between \\\"Air Force One\\\" and his earlier classic U-boat thriller \\\"Das Boot\\\"/\\\"The Boat\\\" (1981). The casting of \\\"Das Boot\\\" star Jurgen Prochnow as the heinous General Radek aids in this comparison. Moreover, Petersen sends his highly mobile and energetic cameras plunging about the corridors of \\\"Air Force One\\\" with the same dexterity that they swept through the hull of the sub in \\\"Das Boot.\\\" Despite a connect-the-dots plot, Petersen makes every dot a fire storm of intensity. The scene where the President's jet careens wildly across the airfield in Germany and nearly crashes is pretty harrowing.  Ford's presidential protagonist is basically Indiana Jones in a suit and tie. The filmmakers rely on Ford's action hero charisma to compensate for the lack of depth in his inadequately sketched head of state. Shrewdly, they shift gears to the parental side of the chief executive. Ford's best scenes occur before take-off when he asks about his favorite football game. Although Marshall emerges as a cardboard politician, it's his \\\"Die Hard\\\" courage that wreathes him with laurels. Unlike those wimpy Jack Ryan movies \\\"Patriot Games\\\" and \\\"A Clear and Present Danger,\\\" Harrison Ford's hero here kills the villains. The bad guys don't slip out of Marshall's clutches and conveniently impale themselves on sharp objects. (Remember the way the \\\"Patriot Games\\\" villain died?) Marshall runs up a body count, kills with a machine gun, snaps necks, and slugs it out with rough and tumble adversaries. Ford is one of the few male box office stars who can shed tears (when Ivan threatens to pull the trigger on his daughter) and not make it look schmaltzy. Ford manages to maintain a stiff upper lip throughout \\\"Air Force One\\\" and his scenes with bad guy Gary Oldman crackle with electricity. Ultimately, however, Ford's performance qualifies as serviceable, nothing truly special like the cop the played in \\\"The Devil's Own\\\" (1997).  The real casting coup in \\\"Air Force One\\\" is Glenn Close as Vice President Kathryn Bennett. Close manages to hold her own in a room packed with veteran male character actors like \\\"Quantum Leap's\\\" Dean Stockwell who constantly bullies Close to usurp presidential authority. Although certainly not the most original skyjacking melodrama, \\\"Air Force One\\\" manages to add elements to the formula and boasts enough visceral R-rated violence to keep you distracted throughout its 124-minute running time.\", \"This movie shows with total realism the heroism of a band of American people when their plane is high-jacked by terrorists. Harrison Ford plays the US President and he is not going to make things easy for terrorists- that's for sure. In my country we see Harrison Ford as a true American hero. He rocks in every movie.  The great storyline and wonderful acting of a great cast full of amazing American actors will make you enjoy this superb production that has everything.  Good drama and spontaneous signs of patriotism, together with a powerful script and unexpected ending. This movie shows a lot of good things about how Americans deal successfully against terrorists.  All in all it is a must see and you will always remember some good quotes along the whole movie. Specially people from Europe and Asia will love this excellent movie which has everything.\", \"If you saw \\\"Airport '77\\\", \\\"Passenger 57\\\", and \\\"The Peacemaker\\\" then you have seen this movie. The good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. And surprise surprise good wins. Oh, sorry I gave away the ending.\", \"It was the most annoying and stupidest film that I saw in 1997. I remember reading somewhere where Harrison Ford had stated about his dislike for the film, Blade Runner(1982). Well, Air Force One(1997) is a lousy feature compared to that scifi classic. Gary Oldman is average as the main villain. One reason I hate this movie is its Hollywood by the numbers approach and lack of any compelling characters.  It seems that Harrison Ford is trying to be John Wayne in his actions and this is the film's fatal mistake. The role of the President was originally written for Kevin Costner who instead choose to do The Postman(1997). I depised Air Force One(1997) so much that I was rooting for the villains to succeed. Air Force One is a disgrace from a compatent director like Wolfgang Petersen who did better things like Das Boot(1981), The Neverending Story(1984), and In the Line of Fire(1993). Glenn Close is the only actor who gives an interesting performance in the movie.\", \"Below average hostage/hijacking/political thriller.  Looking at the cast, one would expect this movie to be worthy of one's time. Harrison Ford, Gary Oldham, William H. Macy, Dean Stockwell, Glenn Close - names that should amount to a watch-worthy experience. However, the movie falls short on all accounts.  Warning: This comment contains minor spoilers.  A poor man's version of the Jack Ryan series. Harrison Ford plays the role of president Marshall, on board the USAF1 which gets hijacked by Kazakh terrorists. Having recently given a speech on his new Just Say No-politics towards terrorists, negotiations appear to be out of the question. Not all of his government and staff agree on this, however.  This could have made an interesting movie. The tension in the White House, when faced with the fact that it is the country's leader who is taken hostage, combined with the political intrigues that arise in such a situation, should have been exploited further. Instead, we are treated with the traditional gung-ho blazing guns solutions where one man saves the day. We've seen it a million times before, and a hundred times better.  Even the special effects are highly ordinary. A lot of them are clearly computer generated, and it is a let-down when it becomes this visible. Better airplane fighting scenes were filmed 40 years ago.  Every clich\\u00e9 appears, even the amazing \\\"fighting inside an airplane with a big hole in its side, without being sucked out into thin air\\\" scene.  Some enjoyment can be had from trying to find the most stupid scene. My favorite: Look for the parachuting secretary with a happy smile on her face, 15000 feet above sea level, wearing only a thin blouse.  From the acting, it seems that the actors are aware that this is not the movie they will be rememvered by. Particularly disappointing is Gary Oldham on autopilot, as the one-dimensional villain. Ford ditto, as the good guy.  While it is reassuring to see that the American president saves the day yet again, not even the casting crew stars can save this film. In the computer world, GIGO means Garbage In, Garbage Out. It applies here as well. Spend more money on the manuscript next time, Mr. Petersen.  Avoid: 4/10  \", \"STUPID! I think when they rank the worst 100, it should be done relative to the film's budget. If so, Air Force One should qualify. The story is completely asinine. The characters all behave recklessly and ridiculously. Only the redoubtable Jurgen Prochnow manages to come out of this mess with his dignity intact.   Harrison Ford is the least Presidential-acting US President ever to appear on film -- and that includes the likes of Polly Bergen, John Ritter, and Donald Pleasance. Gary Oldham is every cold-war caricature mixed together, then run amok, all wrapped up in a preposterous accent, overblown mannerisms, and a maniacal laugh. Xander Berkeley's stunt was almost as impossible as his wooden performance. Paul Guilifoyle is the most disloyal and ignorant Chief-of-Staff ever depicted. Wendy Crewson is doing a nothing job, and does less with it.   The pacing is so painstakingly slow, it was hard to believe this was an action movie. The special effects were labored and cumbersome, and the score was a near-perfect parody of action movie scores.  I had to write all this because IMDB no longer accepts four-line reviews. If they did, I simply would have written: STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID, etc.\", \"At the risk of sounding like a broken record,this film is more or less a remake of Die Hard,only the skyscraper is replaced with an airplane, and our ordinary tough guy cop is replaced with the leader of the free world.Knowing this fact,it's still a good film.Harrison Ford makes a very believable president,and Gary Oldman a very convincing baddie.Although you know where the plot is going,something about it compels you to continue watching.The very fact that they are thousands of miles in the air grips me personally because I am not very fond of heights,and I found myself gripping my chair arms very tightly as a result.This is basically a \\\"run of the mill\\\" action flick,but still good nonetheless.\", \"The movies plot itself is highly improbable, and there are a lot of factual errors, but do you want a documentary or do ya want to see a cool action movie featuring a butt kicking president played by the guy who did Han Solo? What we have here are some terrorist from Russia I think (why are terrorist from countries that don't actually have gripes with us in the movies) taking over air force one with president and family in tow. Of course, the president does not get captured, but instead eludes the terrorist and complicates matters for them as he frees some of the hostages and instead of leaving himself stays to get his family back. The movie seems to run a little long in places and there are a couple of pointless plot points (the whole Dean Stockwell character), overall though and mainly it is a cool action movie in the same vein as Die Hard or other movies where you have the one free guy making trouble for the bad guys. Speaking of bad guys, Gary Oldman is pretty good here as the head bad guy, so is most of the cast of this flick. Harrison Ford is usually good in anything so he fits right in here and makes for a very heroic albeit unrealistic president.\", \"An imbecile, a liar and a coward for president. Someone who was so fetching afraid of his ally (Bulgaria) that Secret Service agents ORDERED the soldiers from President's escort company to remove the bayonets from their riffles which of course were empty of bullets too. He was so fetching afraid that even the police who were supposed to protect him were disarmed. This movie is so blatant propaganda it is shame for everyone that has created it. Apart from that, the enemies since long time ago are not the Russians. We all know who exactly they are and who exactly they were before becoming an US enemies. Right - they were friends and protected and working with CIA help and American taxpayers money. So don't give us bullshits for breakfast with this, excuse me, movie. 0 points from me.\", \"This movie is by far the most gripping movie of all time! I am a great fan of Mr. Ford and his acting in the movie is spectacular! The graphics alone will shock you and the music by Jerry Goldsmith is very delightful. Anybody who knows Jerry Goldsmith's work will note a Star Trek feel to the music! To sum it up this is a total movie and very watchable over and over again! 10/10\", \"A riveting, exciting, edge of your seat thriller that never lets up. Buoyed by a good cast, script, special effects and directing, this movie is tops in its genre, in my opinion. The only thing I wonder about is Harrison Ford's range of facial expression - he never seems to be able to get that baffled look off his face. Gary Oldman is top-notch as usual, and Glenn Close has ample opportunity to demonstrate her acting talent. If you're looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat from the first moment, Air Force One is it. 8/10.\", \"It's easy to understand why Airforce One was such a big hit. The President saves the country. America has an honorable man as their leader and he's saving them from those no good filthy Reds again. Audiences walked out with pride in their hearts (fuelled by Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score) and they forgot about the LewinskyGate scandal that was going down with the REAL President.  But the film is very good in it's own right too. Wolfgang Peterson creates a heavy feeling of tension, Ford a likable hero and Oldman a hissable villain who was actually quite scary. The film is also very well put together technically. The editing and sound is top-notch.  But there are flaws. And one BIG flaw. Some of the dialogue really sucks. And Wendy Crewson is VERY bad as the First Lady. The only reason her character is even in it is because every President has a First Lady. Her role is totally useless. I predicted her EVERY line of dialogue before she even said it. I am not kidding. Even Oldman at one point tells her to 'SHUT UP!' I never thought I would find myself agreeing with a Russian terrorist but now I have.  If you can overlook this minor, although highly irritating, glitch you will totally enjoy a high-octane action film with many, increasingly exciting, set-pieces. Very cool.\", \"  This is a propaganda film Leni Riefenstahl, Mao and Stalin would be proud of. Senseless, waste of time, starring wooden Harrison Ford who has been playing the same role, since Han Solo and Deckard of Blade Runner, now for 20 years. He is certainly one of the worst professional actors in the world.\", \"Harrison Ford is the president of the United States, and mighty bad ass one man army he is. I wonder if Petersen ment this film to be a parody? the evil Soviet Union threatens to come back! the president of USA is kidnapped by a bunch communist terrorists! but be afraid no more! Harrison Ford steps up and teaches the bad ivans a lesson.  This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Full of cliches, laughably typical red neck patriotism and equally laughable plot!  I was rooting for the \\\"terrorists\\\" for the whole film.\", \"A1 acting and casting. Story-line excellent but slightly unbelievable as to the \\\"special effects\\\", such as the escape capsule. Highly rated, nonetheless. Harrison Ford, as per his norm, does a magnificent and highly believable job in his portrayal of the President - Some day we might have a president that is so action-oriented - but I doubt if we would in my lifetime.\", \"LOL, that just summed up the whole movie, didn't it? So last night I was looking for a movie to watch and in my mom's collection I found \\\"Air Force One\\\" and I noticed that Harrison Ford was in it, so I figured I would give it a look. So I watched it and all I can say is American Propaganda much? Now I'm all American, don't get me wrong, I love my country, but this was a bit much and incredibly insulting. If we really had a president like James Marshall, played by Ford, I'd say America would be a very exciting place of nothing but none-stop action. The whole movie either took itself too seriously or then would get into an Arnold Schwartzenegger type of action movie where Ford would say that little one liner before the big climax. Oh, I loved the 25 endings of how they could keep the action going. Now I love action movies, don't get me wrong, but this story was just silly and unnecessary.  President James Marshell is on the fight of stopping terrorism, Russian terrorism to be more specific. Well he boards his flight back to the states, Air Force One starts off well, but is quickly hijacked by Ivan Korshunov and his men, terrorists who want their General Radek released from prison in return for the passengers on board, which isn't good since I guess he was hard to capture and is a deadly terrorist. Ivan makes threats to kill of the passengers every half hour if the vice president does not meet his demands. But the President does not chicken out, he stays on board and will fight these terrorists and win back the plane.  Air Force One is non-stop action with a mixture of the hit TV show West Wing. Like I said, I don't mind an action movie, sometimes I love the most clich\\u00e9'd one's, but not when it comes to serious stuff like terrorism, but I think I'm speaking from a post 9/11 view, so maybe if I saw this movie a before then, I wouldn't have mind it that much, but even then, there were moments that were terribly over acted and for me, it just didn't work for having a president like James Marshall, please, I wish. I can't wait to see President Bush on top of a tanker sporting a look like Rambo, but I guess I shouldn't hold my breath.  4/10\", \"Ford and Oldman have strong performances, and the script is incredible. Unlike most action movies this film is fresh, and the Russian villains act as believable terrorists. Too bad Ford is not the US President, I would vote for him any day. The director, who did Das Boat, directs this film mechanically, and it is a pleasure to watch the mechanics of this film unravel.\", \"Now I admired the director Wolfgang Petersen after seeing DAS BOOT. This was a flick where I thought: Can't get any better. Of course, at the time, people obviously considered Hollywood a smart career move, but if we now take a look at Petersen's Hollywood films, I really think he should have stayed in Germany. Sure, he wouldn't have the money that he's having at his disposal now, but remember: DAS BOOT had a rather infinitesimal budget and nevertheless managed to thrill, enlighten and entertain millions of viewers. Now, what do we have: A German director who directs patriotic and nationalistic filth that invites the average American Joe to believe in the moral and military superiority of his own country. A movie that doesn't really discuss the topics at hand and divides the cast into good and evil with no shades of grey at all. There's one scene where Gary Oldman as the terrorist aboard the plane says to the president's daughter: Do you think your father is a better man because he's wearing a tie and a suit and because he uses smart bombs? I found this scene to be very interesting, however, in the film it is not dwelt upon. Instead we get Harrison Ford playing the father and leader of clean, wholesome politically America and being politically correct and charming and funny and whatnot. What's the moral of this film: God bless America and no place else.\", \"Harrison Ford is THE movie President of the United States in this movie. Action packed heroism keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole movie. Although the mid-air rescue sequence is a little improbable, the remainder of the movie is extremely believable. This is one of the ten most enjoyable movies I've ever seen - and I've watched it at least six times.\", \"I know what you're thinking, \\\"What the hell is he saying?\\\" It's true that we've had so many biographies about presidents in which some of the movies told about historic incidents, why not have a fictional president that could kick ass and take names? Harrison Ford is the man for the job.  \\\"Air Force One\\\" is a thriller that involves Russian terrorist Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) and his gang of criminals hijacking the first plane along with the president's wife and child and his staff. Meanwhile, President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) is hiding after an attack on the ship where he must reunite with his family before they end up victims to Ivan's plan if the president doesn't release a Russian prisoner who happens to be a general and a terrorist.  The film itself is a nail bitter thriller with an all star cast as Ford and Oldman play their usual good guy/villain roles with Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, Xander Berkerly and William H. Macy in supporting roles. If there was such thing where Harrison Ford had a nomination for president, I would vote.\", \"Air Force One is a very good thriller. The action and suspense will be nothing to forget. This movie is about the President's plane, Air Force One being hijacked by Russian nationalists with the President on board. Now it's up to the President and the Vice-President to negotiate with the terrorists or the hostages will die. The acting in this film is pretty good. Harrison Ford did justice with his outstanding performance as the President. Gary Oldman is good as the evil terrorist. The music in this film is fabulous and patriotic considering that the score took two weeks by Jerry Goldmith to compose. I liked the effects in this film. There is nothing special, but for a film from 1997, this has good effects even though there are few. Overall, this is a good movie for everybody except for kids. This film is a moving picture with outstanding courage. My rating is 10/10.\", \"\\\"Air Force One\\\" is an action picture so full of excitement that it had me on the edge of my seat when I first saw it on the big screen back in 1997. This movie is one heck of a ride. Harrison Ford gives one of the best performances of his career as one U.S. President not to mess with. There are also terrific performances turned in by Glenn Close as the Vice President who deals with the terrorist's demands, and Gary Oldman in a scary piece of acting as the lead terrorist. The other actors in the movie do a good job also. In addition to the performances, there are two other big elements that make \\\"Air Force One\\\" a great movie: the special effects and action scenes; and the presence of the plane itself. The action scenes are some of the best I've ever seen. And when we first see the plane from the inside, it looks as if were on a tour of the actual Air Force One itself and it's fascinating. Suspenseful, thrilling, and just downright exciting, \\\"Air Force One\\\" is a definite must-see.  **** (out of four)\", \"Very entertaining action, once you get past the \\\"believability\\\" problems, i.e., terrorists getting on the plane at all, the plane having an on-board armory, Secret Service agents' inability to shoot accurately, etc.  Acting is good enough that you care about the characters.  As others have noted, the CGI aerial sequences sometimes have the aircraft moving in unnatural or impossible ways, and this is visually jarring. (After the touch-and-go, Air Force One turns a 180 almost like a helicopter) I gave it a 7 out of 10 - not brilliant, but makes for an entertaining evening.\", \"Air Force One is one great ride. What makes it work so well is the conviction that Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman bring to their roles. You can see in each actor's eyes that they stand behind what they believe in. Gary Oldman makes a perfect villian and a very complex one at that. He is not just an average, run of the mill madman. He has a family, he is someone's son and those facts make him that much more real. Harrison Ford is great as the president. He's strong, quick witted, and will do anything he can to save his family and staff from the hijackers. A good ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat for two hours, just as long as you don't ask any questions.\", \"**Warning** Possible Spoilers **   I gave this a 1 because IMDb wouldn't let me give it a zero.  I also must admit that I watched only 30 minutes of this piece of garbage. The hijacking of the President's aircraft by terrorists posing as Russian media was difficult to believe. That six people would be able to carry off such a feat, given the number of secret service agents that travel with the president, is highly unlikely. That hundreds of rounds from automatic weapons and large-caliber handguns could be fired on board an aircraft without affecting any critical systems is debatable. That terrorists could blow the cockpit door open, using some sort of plastic explosive, detonating it by firing a pistol at it (hitting it on the first shot, no less!), yet not injure the pilots or cause any damage to the flight deck is astonishing. When they managed to take control of the plane during landing, perform several off-road maneuvers with the plane that would make a Jeep proud, then get a Boeing 747 airborne again without benefit of a runway, that's when I went Popeye and decided I'd had all I could stand and I could stand no more.  I can suspend my disbelief as well as the next guy, but this was just asking too much.  I won't even go into the cheesy script and listless acting. Shameful.\", \"Harrison Ford plays a president who refuses to negotiate with terrorists. But after one terrorist (Gary Oldman) hijacks the Air Force One and the president's wife and daughter, maybe he will have to rethink his position.  Allegedly, Kevin Costner was supposed to be playing the president. Boy am I glad he was too busy making \\\"The Postman\\\" for this movie. Not only did he make a great Postman, but he would have made a horrible president. When you want drama, you call Costner. When you want action, you call Bruce Willis. When you want the perfect blend of drama and action, you call Harrison Ford (think \\\"The Fugitive\\\", for example... don't think \\\"Star Wars\\\").  Ford is great as a diplomat, but equally as good with a gun and in a fight. But the real star of this is Gary Oldman, who plays an evil and soulless terrorist determined to get his old general freed from prison. Oldman plays it like he means it, killing mercilessly while still appearing cold and calculated rather than insane. The writer even had the decency to have Oldman deliver lines condemning the president for bombing villages while being against terror.  Glenn Close and Dean Stockwell made great supporting stars, and even William H. Macy seemed a little less flamboyant than usual in his role as a military man.  This film is especially interesting in the context of our current president, George W. Bush. Bush has also gone on record many times for not negotiating with terrorists and takes a hardline approach similar to Harrison Ford. What would Bush do if terrorists hijacked his plane or kidnapped his family? Even giving me that visual image made this film worth the viewing.\", \"Air Force One features Harrison Ford, Glenn Close, Gary Oldman, Dean Stockewell, and William H. Macy. A dream cast!

With this in mind Air Force One hits the mark, despite some minor flaws it still delivers tension, drama and action in abundance.  The cast is strong and full of believable characters, the story is compelling and the traditional dose of sentiment is added sparingly and to good effect. Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman both put in solid performances and they are well supported by the likes of Glenn Close and Wendy Crewson.  Overall Air Force One is an safe bet for the average movie fan and should entertain most, without ever really excelling.  7/10\", \"This movie is intriguing in that it actually presages some of the terrorism realized in the tragedy of 9/11.  That said, the film is mortally flawed with stupid and ridiculous contrivances that make is more of a comic book yarn than having the sophistication of, say, a Tom Clancy novel.  High on the \\\"oh come on get real!\\\" factor:   1. Any White House PressSecretary would be far too astute to let a self-describe TV journalist on Air Force One (AF1). The very first thing they would do is check the reporter's credentials and publication/broadcast record.  2. The spectacle of a 747 jumbo jet careering through an airport on an aborted landing is simply light-years beyond absurd.  3. Why would AF1 have a stash of enough assault rifles to take over a small country? And, with all the gunplay in the passenger cabin there's not one bullet hole in the fuselage?  4. I have it on good authority that Air Force One does have countermeasures, but putting the president in an escape pod \\u0096 though fundamental to the plot \\u0096 it just inane. That's the *last* thing you would do with the U.S. President at 30,000 ft.  5. Equally ridiculous is the idea that AF1 conveniently has more parachutes onboard than the Titanic had life preservers. Just as silly is the image of Washington bureaucrats easily jumping off the plane at 15,000 ft.  6. I've been inside an open, stripped-down 747 airframe, there isn't nearly as much room as shown on the cargo deck. There certainly isn't room for a cargo deck vending machine?!   I could go on and on, but this film is another example of filmmakers believing that movies goers are gullible enough to swallow any tall tale for the sake of lots of action shots and melodrama.

You'll be sorry.\", \"My friends and I rented that movie last night and we had one of the greatest laughs in awhile. The movie is not supposed to be funny at all, but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any realism whatsoever. First, Phillippe (I forget what his character is called and I don't really care) uses his regular employee ID to go through all the top-security terminals. Not only is that pathetic but it gets topped when his enormous efforts culminate in his finding the so-scary Lego-room, which hosts the super computers. This is plain funny. The tense mood that we are supposed to experience is completely spoilt by the childish looking room. The ending, like all else, is very very very cheesy, especially when the bad guy's lawyer shows up 'right on time'. Anyway, this movie is a good laugh. If you need something to make fun of, definitely see it.\", \"Five minutes into this movie you realize that you have seen it all before. It is BOILER ROOM. It is THE FIRM. And it is THE DEVILS ADVOCATE. And there are NO new elements here. Except for the all-to-clear Bill Gates-allegory. Conpsiracies are always good stuff for movie-making, but why does it have to be so extreme ? Boiler room is a good movie, because it - for a while at least - seems realistic. In Antitrust everything is wrong. How realistic is it for example that your boss pay an impostor to be your girlfriend in order to make you work harder and control you ? I'd give it 1, but the soundtrack is OK, so 2/10.\", \"After seeing the trailer of this film in the cinema, i thought that it was an original concept for a thriller, setting it in the competitive world of computer companies. The all star cast was another message that this film would probably be good. But when i didn't go to watch it in it's first week of release then it disappeared by week 2 i feared something was a miss. Patiently i waited for it's DVD release, then bought it rushing home for an enjoyable evening's viewing. The anticipation on the way home was far better than the film. For a start the direction is appalling. There's no thought gone into it at all and the director just makes up a part for himself, so he can appear in the film. I wouldn't be rushing out to employ him in the future. Secondly the lead role is completely miscast as Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe normally the cool character as in Cruel Intentions and Way of the Gun but in this he's supposed to be a bumbling hero which he attempts to portray by slipping when he's running and having geeky friends, but he just doesn't look right. The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani don't feature enough but when they do neither of the performances are close to their bests. The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been made for him and it's his fiery temper and mysterious ways that drag the film along. The final point is that this film is another one which fills the trailer with scenes you don't see in the film and instead feature only in the deleted scenes section of the DVD. Causing even more disappointment as although some of these scenes are crude they do fill in important gaps in the story.\", \"Antitrust falls right into that category of films that aspire to make some great point while being uplifting yet falls completely flat. I don't hate the film, but it is missing key elements, such as suspense. There have been other attempts to make an engaging film about computers, such as Hackers and The Net. They all fall short. The improbable ending of both The Net and Antirust seem to be nearly identical. These movie endings suffer from one huge error in perception: People in the PC business having this over-indulgent self ego that assumes the general population lives it's life waiting to hear the latest news about PC's and software. I have worked for many companies and industries, and they all seem to suffer from an expanded view of their own self-importance, as does this film.  The way they introduced plot lines was pathetic. Showing Milo, who is deathly allergic to Sesame Seeds, almost ingest one from a restaurant breadbasket crossed the line of stupidity. Only his 'girlfriend' prevented him from sure death. This makes one wonder how Milo could have survived as long as he did, braving the perils of Big Mac buns and Sesame Seed breadsticks, as they cloak themselves as, well.... Sesame Seed breadsticks and Big Mac buns.  Antitrust also doesn't provide much suspense. The patterned and predictable plot twists are easily figured out long before they are revealed (come on, was anyone REALLY stunned when Yee Jee Tso was killed?), thereby destroying any real shock value. And here again we have yet another film/story where at the end, the bad guys are chasing the good guys to 'get the disk'. We need to have a moratorium on this Simple Simon plot line for about 20 years. Still, I pressed on. Maybe the ending would be the payoff, but no. The completely ridiculous ending where we have the head of company security, another supposed evil guy, turn around and be the good guy that enables Milo to bring down N.U.R.V CEO Gary Winston was laughable. And of course, the news coverage of the arrest of Gary Winston is more fevered than when Hinckley or Oswald was brought into custody. Gary Winston, played by Tim Robbins, is a cardboard cutout of the same character Robbins played in Arlington Road. But that fits perfectly here in Antitrust, which should be called 'Anticlimactic' or 'Anti-Original'.  In the years to come, this film will likely be banished, to be shown only on your local third rate UHF channel.\", \"I sort of accidentally ended up watching this movie. I'm still not sure if I regret it or not. I felt like I was watching the film made by that group of film school students that didn't quite make the cut. It plays up every Hollywood clich\\u00e9 imaginable, all the while flogging us with the 'corporations are the ultimate evil' message. Subtlety this movie does not know. As far as that goes, it even manages to provide it's own spoilers.  The story appears to be a computer nerd's fantasy world come true. The lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend, yet is a programming genius and apparent hacker (I think), among many other nerd-fantasy-come-true elements that you'll have to see for yourself.  As well, I should've known it would be a z-movie when I saw Ned Bellamy... he tends to be a good tip-off.  Can't recommend this one, I'm afraid.\", \"One more of extremely unprofessional movies about computer programmers.  Looks authors of that movie don't know real specific of programmers world.  20 top programmers in the world, program which have own satellites (for what?), program which using satellite freq., somebody kill somebody to steal the codes (why?) and much more of stupid moments at this movie.  Peoples who not programmers not will see something awful at that movie, because not professionals on this. But peoples will see not real things.  Programmers will find that movie odd and awful - because lots of moments inside movie is not RELATED real life (why movie not scifi in this case?).\", \"Obvious attack on Microsoft made by people who don't appear to understand intellectual property or market economies generally.  Loony liberal tim robbins plays a painfully obvious caricature of bill gates, and is a cartoonish corporate villain ordering murders right and left.  While microsoft may engage in some anticompetitive activity at times, it's unlikely they actually murder people. Therefore, the film is over the top and ridiculous from the beginning.  The \\\"deeper\\\" point is apparently that major tech innovations should be free to the public, and not subject to intellectual property laws. However, this ignores the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed if not for the market incentives (and rewards) provided by intellectual property.  It's one thing to be opposed to anti-competitive conduct -- that's common sense. It's quite another to be opposed to market competition in the first place, which is what the film's mantra (\\\"knowledge belongs to mankind\\\") represents.  Yet another example of Hollywood being completely out of touch with reality.\", \"AntiTrust could have been a great vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director cut out her best scenes. In the scenes that she are in, she is just a zombie. She is involved in a sub-plot that is simular to a sub-plot in \\\"Get Carter\\\", but she handles the sub-plot better in \\\"Get Carter\\\".(I blame the director) The director's homage to Hitchcock was corny. (It's the scene were Ryan Philippe's charactor realizes he may not be able to trust Tim Robbin's charactor, at least I think it's a homage to Hitchcock. The DVD shows the scenes that were cut out. I think the director should have trust his instincts and not listen to the test audiences.\", \"It was interesting to see how accurate the writing was on the geek buzz words, yet very naive on the corporate world. The Justice Department would catch more of the big corp giants if they did such naive things to win. The real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting, yet every bit as sinister. I seriously doubt ANY corp would actually kill someone directly; even the mod is more indirect these days. In the real world, they do kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, poisons, etc. This movie must have been developed by some garage geeks, I think, and the studios didn't know the difference. They just wanted something to capitalize on the Microsoft antitrust case in the news.\", \"A terrible movie as everyone has said. What made me laugh was the cameo appearance by Scott McNealy, giving an award to one of the murdered programmers in front of a wall of SUN logos. McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that practically defines itself by its hatred of Microsoft. They have been instrumental in filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft. So, were they silly enough to think this bad movie would add fuel to that fire?  There's no public record I see of SUN's involvement, but clearly the makers of this movie know Scott McNealy.

The music is so great that it became the theme music for the TV show IRON CHEF (though it is WAY overused and too intrusive in the movie). So, how did this movie end up so poor?!?!

What person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the STUPID macho bull-crap that purports to be dialog? You get much greater realism from most cartoons! The bottom line is that this movie has some good points but is so marred by hackneyed clich\\u00e9s and rotten dialog that it quickly becomes tiresome. And, this is a shame, because firemen deserve a better tribute than this mess! If you don't believe me, look at the number of goofs listed on IMDb for this movie--WAY in excess of what you'd expect to find. They just didn't care enough to work out all the kinks and problems. So, as a result the movie seems rushed and in need of a re-write and re-editing.\", \"If You can watch a film without worrying about the plot, or corny acting, then Backdraft is definitely the one.  However, if, like me, you like watching films that you can believe, then Backdraft has some serious flaws. It doesn't offer anything new, and there are hundreds of 90's action films that follow identical formulas, whilst not being quite as clunky.  After two firefights, i'm thinking, this has got to go somewhere else, i mean, how many big fires are there in one city? Surely firemen do other things, such as getting cats out of trees? Well I was wrong, and the repetition continues again and again, up until the end.  A good aspect of the film is the fire itself, well filmed, and I must say i felt quite hot while watching it, which suggests that two hours of watching fire without a story or acting would have been more suited to my taste.\", \"I loved this movie when I was a teenager. LOVED it. It hasn't grown up with me, though. Maybe that's because it's a melodramatic load of old rubbish, full of macho posturing, cheesy dialogue, overwrought slo-mo and characters saying 'Goddammit' a lot. The lumpy narrative blobs gracelessly from one character to another, one plot strand to another, without ever bringing it all together, and it doesn't help that William Baldwin's mono-expression of a performance is wet enough to put out every fire in the movie's overlong runtime. Robert DeNiro and Donald Sutherland are worth watching, but no one's really at the top of their game here, and the women folk get particularly short thrift. The only real impact comes from the impressive firefighting sequences, and Hans Zimmer's majestic score, which remains one of my all-time favourites.\", \"The other day I showed my boyfriend a great movie, Stand By Me, a movie I have shown to many people and they absolutely adored it, but for some odd reason he didn't like it. He lends me a movie called Backdraft and he tells me that he's shown it to many people and they loved it, instead I hated this movie. I don't think I've hated a movie so much in a while, how this movie has even a 6.6 rating is beyond me. I couldn't keep up with the five million stories here: Billy Baldwin becoming a fire man, the random sibling rivalry, the random love story(s), the who's being an arson story, the investigator, the fire who has a personality of it's own. I just have a problem that this movie can't keep up with all these stories, they didn't balance out well enough make the film interesting. I would have just preferred if this movie was about being a firefighter or the investigator and how he came to be one or what it is exactly he does and why.  The movie tells the story of a group of Chicago firefighters, two brothers. Stephen \\\"Bull\\\" McCaffrey, the elder brother, is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights. Brian, the younger brother quit the fire fighting academy school several years before, then embarking on a number of other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter. He is looked down on by his elder brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a fire fighter. Donald \\\"Shadow\\\" Rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession. He is called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections. .Martin Swayzak is an alderman on the City Council. He has obvious hopes of being elected to mayor, but has had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department. Many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that he has made are endangering the lives of the firefighters. However, Swayzak is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffectual after firemen are repeatedly being killed in blazes.  I just couldn't get into this movie, I don't know how anyone else could, it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed firefighters all wrong. I loved how they had every action clich\\u00e9 in the book to match this action flick. I just felt also like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles, Donald Sutherland, great actor, but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the upcoming talent at the time. I know Ron was going for great quality, but I think him casting such huge actors in small roles was a mistake for this film. I even had to joke my way through while watching this movie commenting how the doctor in the background was probably Kevin Spacey. The fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there, I didn't enjoy it and honestly wouldn't recommend it to people, I'll stick to the recommendations in my relationship from this point on.  2/10\"], \"review_score\": [2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 2], \"review_category\": [\"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 2.6666666666666665}, \"Bad Lieutenant\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0103759\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Bamboozled\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0215545\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Barry Lyndon\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0072684\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Basic\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0264395\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Big Fish\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0319061\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Birthday Girl\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0188453\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 30, \"review_content\": [\"And I am a Nicole Kidman fanatic.

The relationships in the film are believeable, with Nicole and Chaplin working against each other beautifully. The humour is subtle, with some great 'Office'-like scenes at the bank, and the thriller element add tension without being Hollywood.  Overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation.

I have to comment on Nicole Kidmans acting in this movie. Some of her other works haven't shown the amazing talent this woman has, but Birthday Girl doesn't suffer from this in the slightest. Even without words Kidmans acting shines through.\", \"I caught this on the dish last night. I liked the movie. I traveled to Russia 3 different times (adopting our 2 kids). I can't put my finger on exactly why I liked this movie other than seeing \\\"bad\\\" turn \\\"good\\\" and \\\"good\\\" turn \\\"semi-bad\\\". I liked the look Ben Chaplin has through the whole movie. Like \\\"I can't belive this is happening to me\\\" whether it's good or bad it the same look (and it works). Great ending. 7/10. Rent it or catch it on the dish like I did.\", \"Good, funny, straightforward story, excellent Nicole Kidman (I almost always like the movies she's in). This was a good \\\"vehicle\\\" for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both. A romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories, great closing lines. Chaplin, very good here, was also good in another good, but unpopular romantic comedy (\\\"Truth about Cats & Dogs\\\"). Maybe they're too implausible. Ebert didn't even post a review for this. The great \\\"screwball\\\" comedies obviously were totally implausible (\\\"Bringing up Baby\\\", etc.). If you've seen one implausible comedy, you've seen them all? Or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s. Weird. Birthday Girl is a movie I've enjoyed several times. Nicole Kidman may be the \\\"killer app\\\" for home video.\", \"This is a great little film, that's very unique, and creative, with some great plot twists and wonderful performances!. All the characters are great, and the story while bizarre, is fascinating and very interesting, plus Nicole Kidman is simply amazing in this!. It's very hard to describe this movie, because it really is quite bizarre, it's a comedy/romance, one minute then it turns into a thriller the next, however it was still very entertaining all the same, plus Nicole's Russian accent was fantastic, and extremely convincing. Chaplin and Kidman had very good chemistry together, and i loved Vincent Cassel's performance!, plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise!. The ending was very cute, and it's unpredictable throughout!, plus this movie is quite underrated as well!. You will feel sorry for Chaplin and the way that he is scammed, and i thought all the characters were really likable, plus the finale is especially good.This is Nicole's movie though, and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance!. This is a great little film, that's very unique, and creative, with some great plot twists and wonderful performances!, i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Jez Butterworth does a very good job here, with great camera work, solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace!. The Acting is wonderful!. Nicole Kidman, is stunningly gorgeous!, and is amazing as always, she is incredibly sexy, very likable, had one of the coolest accents, added a lot of presence, had very good chemistry with Ben Chaplin, and had a very mysterious character!, she was amazing. (Kidman Rules!!!!). Ben Chaplin is great here, he is extremely likable, had a cool character, had very good chemistry with Kidman, the only thing i didn't like was him taking out his anger out on Kidman, even though what she did was wrong, and i loved how he got revenge in the end!. Vincent Cassel is fantastic as the main villain, yes he was OTT, but he was very intense and quite creepy at times, this role was perfect for him. Mathieu Kassovitz is OK here, but didn't have much to do. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5\", \"I've had a lot of experience with women in Russia, and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like, unfortunately. They are very cunning, ruthless, and greedy, as well as highly unfair. From the robotic sex, the hustling for gifts, to the lies and betrayal, I've experienced it all in Russia.  I know what I'm talking about. And here are my qualifications: Here are the photojournals of my three trips to Russia in search of a bride. It includes thousands of pics of many hot Russian girls I met, black comedy, scams I was privy to, and the story of my mugging and appearance on Russian national TV.  http://www.happierabroad.com/Photojournals.htm  It's like Reality TV. You will love it. I spent a ton of time putting it together. So check it out. The Russian woman that Nicole Kidman plays is a lot like the Julia and Katya in my photojournals.  My 3 bride seeking trips in Russia happen to be very exciting and would sell, so why don't they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in Russia? However, there is one factual impossibility in this film, and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport. It doesn't work that way at all, so I don't understand why the media likes to perpetuate this. There isn't a single Russian bride introduction website that works this way, and I challenge anyone to find one that does. The fact is, you can only order the Russian lady's CONTACT INFO (email, address, phone number, etc.) from the website. From there, you correspond and then visit her, and if you want to bring her to your country, you start the immigration process at your INS office, and wait months after that. That's how it works in real life. You can't just order her to arrive at your airport. US Immigration would NEVER allow such a thing to happen.  WuMaster   - I got everything I wanted by going abroad! You can too! http://www.happierabroad.com\", \"Nicole Kidman is a wonderful actress and here she's great. I really liked Ben Chaplin in The Thin Red Line and he is very good here too. This is not Great Cinema but I was most entertained. Given most films these days this is High Praise indeed.\", \"Every time I see Nicole I like her more. I love a movie like this. A woman you just won't give up on, but she keeps breaking your heart. First movie I remember seeing like this was Of Human Bondage, the Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey version. The beefs about the correctness of the Russian spoken in this film are petty, it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can't speak Russian, I'm sure. Funny how people miss the point. The no-goodnik Russian guys were well cast too. Finally, I have to tip my hat to Ben Chaplin, as somebody else noted, he plays a sap with great dignity, and there was definitely some heat between him and Nicole. To think, guys get PAID for that, mind-blowing.\", \"Modern, original, romantic story.  Very good acting of both Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin.  Miss Kidman does a nice job in imitating a Russian accent. Ben Chaplin is also good as the shy, dull clerk. For the men (and some women) : miss Kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic. I forgot what a gorgeous woman she is. It's not hard to imagine that John falls in love with her. Some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense. Although I hoped for a happy ending, the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me.   Conclusion : good movie.   Les Pays-Bas : huit points.\", \"A small funny film. It is totally incredible, unbelievable, impossible. But it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized, even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms. Of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the Internet. You must not believe ten percent of what you're told there and never, ever, ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally. Most of their \\\"businesses\\\" there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you. But here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive, he is absurdly silly. But then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning. One think is sure too. Security in English airports is not exactly what it should be, but I guess it's not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically. Then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage, a real plague on modern airports, and don't expect to get fair compensation. Or even confiscating a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous. I can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener. Funny, isn't it? Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines\", \"When I saw Birthday Girl I liked it so much I set out to see every Nicole Kidman film I could, only to find all of them a disappointment compared to it. I theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control, with Nicole Kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to film enjoyment--IMHO. Thus for instance, Dogville, even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is hammering home, or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone else's attention, or other pet causes of Kidman's.   Here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job. I don't how or who was able to restrain her, but apparently it worked. The way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman. And consequently, what makes a man's most desperate hopes marginally attainable.   Of course, the fact the male lead transforms from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy, but his transformation is adequately believable. It isn't coyly contrived as it would be in a film engineered to bolster male ego. Instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances.  Also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human, apart from their criminal mission. Her gang has a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to American culture. And while they are his adversaries, they are never really his enemy. In effect, they teach him to be compete.  I really marveled at Kidman's ability to physically appear Russian. It had me wondering whether her ancestry was Russian, but none of the photos of her I examined showed any hint of it. Maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing.   I can only hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out another great film. Despite my gratuitous digs at Ms. kidman, the message is this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a lifetime.\", \"This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you leave away pretending you know or you care what Communism was about and how real Russians or Brits are, if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions, you can have fun with this film. Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out-shadowed by Nicole, and the rest of the cast does good work as well. The final is moving, and logical - movie logics, of course. Worth watching, if you accept the rules of the game.\", \"The critics didn't like this film. It bombed in the States and as a result received only a limited showing in Britain. Which was a great shame, because it represents British rather than American humour and should have been shown in Britain first.  Nicole Kidman looks stunning and is a totally convincing Russian. Ben Chaplin is the Dustin Hoffman character from 'The Graduate', and 'Birthday Girl' has at least 4 scenes which remind the viewer of that 1960s classic (despite being a totally different story!).  Sure it changes tack a number of times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure - but it's memorable, moving and a weclome breath of fresh air compared to the average mega-budget blockbuster.  See it with an open mind!\", \"From what critics and audiences indicated, BIRTHDAY GIRL had to be a big fat clinker. Still, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent it last night. It proved to be quite worthy of watching. Sure, it isn't your basic American comedy, and it doesn't take a genius to realize that it is a very British movie, but that's why I liked it. It was a change from all the other movies around, a breath of fresh air. Sure, there were some plot holes, but overall it worked. First off, Kidman was fabulous again in a very different, not very glamorous, but still quite sexy role. She just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in Hollywood. Not only is her Russian accent when she speaks English effective, but there are times when she carries on long conversations in Russian and if you didn't know it was Nicole Kidman, you would never question her authenticity. Harrison Ford should have taken note in \\\"K-19.\\\" Overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz.\", \"This film is definitely an odd love story. Though this film may not be much to shout about, Nicole Kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten, though Ben Chaplin does do quite a good job of Hertfordshire Life with shots of St Albans & Hemel Hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area. What starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular British TV series\\\"Heartbeat\\\" soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flick.Nothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus ends-up as fairly decent weekend entertainment. A good one to watch, and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character.\", \"Are you a giraffe?... ask John to Nadia, and she, sure of responding well, responds him: yes. In this way begin the communication between a man and a woman who don't know each other, and at the same time, the questions and doubts in \\\"Birthday Girl\\\". A film that i heard a lot of times, but i don't dare to see... until two hours of write this.  \\\"Birthday Girl\\\" is a passionate movie that makes me fall in count, at the same time, that Nicole Kidman is one of the best actress (Besides she is pretty and intelligent) that i have ever seen. \\\"Birthday Girl\\\" is the story of a lonely and routine man who looks for a wife at internet. The woman that he finds comes from Russia. She seems to be that delicate woman, normal, not more. One day, in her birthday comes suddenly, his cousin and his friend. The man, begin to discover certain things. Since here, he don't going to be the lonely and routine man that always have been.  Much of us going to think that this movie is just a regular one with a exploited plot. Much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and don't novel. But \\\"Birthday Girl\\\" is just the opposite. This movie is full of good surprises, good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined. This romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of proposes for the films of it kind. \\\"Birthday Girl\\\" have certain beauty and crudeness in its scenes, but at the same time, certain touching nature, and makes it so deeper.  \\\"Birthday Girl\\\" is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes violent, but at the end, is totally satisfactory. And I'm not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece.  *Sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.\", \"The trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice. And while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across, the first half of the movie being a light, romance comedy and the second have a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than I thought it would be. This movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course I'm biased, but this movie proved to be a light, sensitive, if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better. Three out of four stars. 9/5/02.\", \"This is a good example a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching. The story is engaging and it doesn't take long before the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin grabs your attention. The acting is first class and the characters are represented well. Sometimes it feels like the director couldn't decide himself between drama and romantic comedy. Ben Chiller's portrayal of the law abiding and shy Englishman with porn S.M. magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs! As does the look in Nicole Kidman's eyes when she is offering John his first taste of intimacy in a long time... Other times the actors and especially Nicole Kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic slant.\", \"For a film that got little publicity, and few people have heard about, this was pretty good. It's another one of these modern-day British crime films that are quirky (\\\"Snatch,\\\" \\\"Sexy Beast,\\\" etc.). It's not wild like \\\"Snatch\\\" but it's interesting and it has some rough characters.  It also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show - not late - has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first-time viewer. Basically, it's about a low-key British male who sends away for a Russian \\\"mail order bride\\\" who winds up, with the aid of two Russian male friends, providing a couple of big surprises.  Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star, and are very good as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is a different kind of film and well-acted. Kidman once again proves she's far more than just a beautiful face.\", \"John (Ben Chaplin) is a lonely bank clerk who lives in a small town not far from London. Though the Internet, he contacts a Russian agency of brides. He selects Sophia (Nicole Kidman \\u0096 the guy could be lonely and shy, but certainly has a good taste, doesn't he?) and when they met each other, he realizes that she does not speak English. The communication between each other is basically limited by sex (again, imagine, what a terrible situation for the guy, just have some kinky sex with Nicole Kidman!). On her birthday, two Russian friends of her visit them. Then, lots of surprises will happen. I liked this movie: first, it is almost impossible to be 'labeled'. Is it a black comedy, an action, a thriller movie? I believe all the choices are correct. Nicole Kidman is gorgeous as usual, and I am very curious about her Russian: is she speaking Russian in a correct accent indeed, or just faking? Anyway, I found it an enjoyable movie. My vote is eight.  Title (Brazil): \\\"A Isca Perfeita\\\" (\\\"The Perfect Bait\\\")\", \"This movie really woke me up, like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber.  This guy John (Ben Chaplin) leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial English town, until the stunningly gorgeous, wild, girl-to-die-for Nadia (Nicole Kidman), ordered by email from Russia, enters his life to become his beloved wife, by Johns plan. However a glitch turns up - Nadia does not speak a word of Johns language. Although calm and emotionless on the outside, John becomes so interested in beautiful Nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service, he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process.  What happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor John from his slumber of a decently-paid safe-feeling clerk into a decision-making decently thinking action figure, giving the viewer a subliminal message \\\"you would have probably acted likewise\\\".  Kidman, Cassel & Kassovitz make a great team acting Russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing, \\\"almost\\\" only due to the slight accent present in their Russian dialogues, however slight enough to amaze a native Russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right. Nicole Kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background.  The pace of the film is fast and captivating, and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear, you rather feel that you're in the middle of the plot, and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out.  My advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy. To sum it up, it has an unusual plot, great acting, and ideas below the surface. Like the idea of the \\\"rude awakening\\\" from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a Society's machine, the life which members of the Fight Club were so keen to quit and the machine of which Pink Floyd sings (\\\"Welcome to the machine!\\\"). I bet that in the end, John was rather off with Sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all.  Thank you, writers, for the great story, and everyone else for this great movie! Please make a sequel! And you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever, because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99.9999 percent of the potential viewers, I am sure of it.\", \"This film features Ben Chaplin as a bored bank employee in England who orders a mail order bride from Russia, recieves Nicole Kidman in the mail and gets more than he bargained for when, surprise, she isn't what she appears to be. The story is fairly predictible and Chaplin underacts too much to the point where he becomes somewhat anoying. Kidman is actualy rather good in this role, making her character about the only thing in this film that is interesting. GRADE: C\", \"Nothing in this film interested me. I thought the actors were asleep while they were performing. That's not laid-back Stanislofsky method, that's just walking-through and saying lines, I'm afraid. Kidman's performance is sad. The story is, however, mildly entertaining if you want to put up with the bad acting.\", \"this movie is the worst ive seen.. nicole kidman really dissapointed me.. this movie has nothing. i would not watch it again even if it were the last movie on earth. great actors but bad script.\", \"This film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the DVD. However, the resulting movie is absolutely dire! Admittedly, this is not the worst film ever made, or the worst film this year, but it came damn close!  The main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? The story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, but the film is a mess. What starts out as a mildly interesting \\\"comedy\\\" (a word I use in the loosest possible terms), then goes totally in reverse, and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin is wasted! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only presume did this for the money.  This is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect. It's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty. A film to be avoided, unless you absolutely have to see Kidman or Chaplin in every one of their films!\", \"It seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive (maffia-like) character of Russians, or at least of those Russians able to travel outside their big country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and that British police is so inefficient that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and the supposed Russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere, probably spoken by Aliens in the Ural mountains, but far to be the Russian one. So Nicole, if you really want to talk Russian, kindly go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep yourself busy learning Russian language grammar and its pronunciation.\", \"Birthday Girl doesn't know what it wants to be - is it a comedy,, is it a drama...it just doesn't know. What could have been a very funny or touching film ends up in no-man's land. The premise is original enough to have warranted a script full of interesting scenarios but hardly delivers any and ends up petering out. This is a real shame if you look at the cast - it's very solid all the way through but they don't get the chance to shine.

Let me say that -- after having watched the entire film and the special features on the DVD -- my wife and I watched the whole film again with the director's commentary running. I can't remember having ever before endured more than 7 minutes of such commentary for a film. It's worth hearing.  I'm not a southern boy, but I spent some time around Memphis a long time ago, and have a feel for the area. This film almost smells of the South, it's so real. Samuel Jackson, one of my all-time favorite actors, is magnificent as the emotionally bent Lazarus, and Christina Ricci gives the performance of a lifetime as Rae, a woman who's been wounded severely during her brief life. I've always liked Ms. Ricci's work, but in this performance she's giving 137% of herself every second she's on the screen. Awards and little statues are not enough to reward her for what she lays before the audience in this film.   There are other places where you can read the essence of the story, so I'm just commenting on the work. I'd heard the name Justin Timberlake before seeing \\\"BSM,\\\" but had no idea what he looked like, or even why he's famous. Bumping my head on 60 years old, I'm outside his target demographic, to say the least. After seeing this film I will recognize him. He can act! He gives a substantial, believable performance as the loving soulmate of the county slut.   The director is from Memphis, and shows reverence for his home region. He is also a fine story teller.  .....and I MUST mention the music. I love Blues, and the soundtrack for Black Snake Moan is a veritable feast for a blues fan.   I'm writing less coherently than usual because my enthusiasm for this movie is overcoming my sentence structure. See this film, and I mean now.\", \"Better than I expected from a film selling itself on the premise of nymphomania and inter-racial bondage. The music is great, and cinematography focuses greatly on turning Ricci into a trailer trash Betty Paige and it works. Samuel L. get's to shout a lot, which he's good at, as well as play lots of blues guitar, which he looks cool doing. Even Justin Timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend. I get the feeling that this material under anyone else would have been complete s*%#, but instead managed to just barley carve out it's own odd little transgressive pulp niche, while still being an effective drama.\", \"I opted to watch this film for one reason and one reason alone...Samuel L. Jackson. I happen to like him, a lot. I had seen no previews or trailers for this overlooked film, so went into it with no real expectations.  Jackson didn't disappoint as Lazarus, a down-on-his-luck blues man in the Deep South, and delivered perhaps his most powerful performance ever, including playing and singing a number of excellent blues tunes. But the real surprise here was Christina Ricci, at best a vapid airhead in real life, who took the role of the sexually-abused town tramp Rae and made her a believable, almost even likable character. Watching the decidedly non-sexual relationship evolve between Lazarus and Rae was simply amazing.  Justin Timberlake, pop star turned wanna-be actor, should go back to causing \\\"wardrobe malfunctions\\\" and prancing around a pop stage. His mostly forced performance was distracting, at best, from the real story here.  This movie is raw, gritty, and at times quite \\\"in your face\\\". Not everyone will like it. Those that do, however, will be quickly moving it to the top of their favorites list.\", \"Initially I was put off renting this movie due to the jacket art for the DVD. In fact, this held true with friends of mine who didn't rent it due to the art and the mental image(s) it conjured of being a movie that held little or no interest to me (or to my friends). But, I rented and watched it and was truly amazed.  I agree with another user's comments that this movie is not for everyone due to the blatant sexual inferences, so it is definitely not something I'd want young children to watch (and doubt seriously if they would understand it anyway).  I enjoy movies like this whereby the character's personalities and who they are are genuinely defined in a no-nonsense, direct way with no teasers to indicate they will turn out bad. The acting done ... was it acting? Ricci and Jackson performed so well, I was drawn into this movie not even realizing they were acting. Same thing with the story ... may seem far-fetched somewhat, but it was done so very, very well. It reminded me of another movie with Mel Gibson, Tim, where each character had limitations, whether mental or circumstantial, so were well-defined.  I found much depth in this movie with the character's involved, so feel that everyone involved (from the cameramen to the actors) should be commended on a perfect fit/result. After viewing this movie, I had talked to a couple of friends who had a negative approach to watching it like I did, so after hearing my comments, they rented and watched it. They, too, were quite surprised at how good it was. It is too bad that the art on the jacket was done the way it was since it is a turn off. I can see now how the art applies, but I'd not heard of this movie before, and the art was my first impression ... art sells or destroys DVD sales/rentals.  These characters had more depth to them and good timing was allotted to give an audience like me time to absorb the \\\"feel\\\" for each. I felt I could trust the movie to flow well, and it did. So, with the jacket art aside, I would recommend watching this movie.\", \"The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.  Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along. Maybe it's just me though, but I think poor Lazarus should've had his story focused on more. He's a hurting man after his wife leaves him, but we never fully see how helping Rae resolve her past pains heals him too. It's just implied that it does--in essence, he plays the wizard that helps the young Rae overcome her curse, through a big ol' chain and some blues.  I like the story, but I wish it were a bit more even and didn't have to rely on the sensational. The side characters were fairly decent, if simple and I liked the music. The acting was good enough, although I can't be certain if the Rae character is fully believable. But that might just be my naivety.  All in all, I liked the film, but I wasn't compelled by it. Maybe it's that I'm too critical, but the story seems a little too convenient to be fully believable and so, while it all seemed very cool, I could never truly buy it. The chain thing was a little too far-fetched for me. Still, this can provide some entertainment for those looking for dramatic redemption stories with a shot of the blues. 7/10\", \"Black Snake Moan is uproarious. It is over-flowingly rich, fantastically orchestrated, strange and cumbersome, unique and visionary. In continuation of Hustle & Flow, Brewer paints his portrait of the American South almost as a mythological land one would expect to see in a Fantasy or Ancient Greece epic. And yet as far high above us his movies hover, they are still rooted; rooted in the deepest, darkest soil there is.  As in traditional fairy-tales, Brewer paints his portrait in Black Snake Moan using extremes and exaggerations. Sharp and stark character traits, when coupled with such extreme acts as chaining a half-naked white girl to a radiator in an attempt to redeem her of her sins, exaggerate and emphasize the metaphor the same way such extreme visual techniques such as some characters having colour in Pleasantville strengthened the metaphor in that fairy tale film. But Brewer doesn't begin his film with \\\"once upon a time\\\"; in this film and also in Hustle & Flow, Brewer presents us with a different fairy tale; a dark, Gothic fable of sex, prostitution, and ultimately, redemption. These themes run through the film's veins like blood and resonate and bloom in its dark, brooding setting.  But despite these harsh extremes, Brewer treats his characters like humans, and creates extremely well-executed, three-dimensional characterizations in Lazarus and Rae, particularly emphasized with their relationships with Lazerus' friend at the pharmacy, Angela, and Rae's mother.  The acting is, all-around, quite perfect. One gets the feeling that both Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson were born to play these roles. Their characterizations are so intense and so severe; it's even more of a challenge for the actors to keep their heads on and craft realistic characters. And they succeed admirably. Samuel L. Jackson in particular utterly disappears into his character, which serves as a polar opposite to most of the character's he's played before. With films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Shaft, and others, he has crafted for himself a typecast of the \\\"ultimate bad-ass\\\". In Black Snake Moan Jackson plays an old, broken, defeated and earthy character quite unlike anything he's done before. And frankly, it's just fantastic. What comes as quite a surprise, though, is the casting of Justin Timberlake, and more specifically, the fact that he comes across as quite tolerable. Sure he doesn't have much screen time, but like what Brewer did with Ludicrous in Hustle & Flow, he actually gets Timberlake to act and do what he is meant to do, and not come across as totally unconvincing and irritating.  But what is really so incredibly great about the movie is the atmosphere Brewer creates. The rural Southern locations work to his advantage in creating a dark, dirty, grimy, crusty, rugged kind of texture to the entire film, which more than fits in with the film's thematic and metaphorical aspects. And by utilizing all sorts of elements such as the rising sound of cicadas when Rae gets her itch, or a raging thunderstorm that increases and intensifies as Lazarus plays his \\\"Black Snake Moan\\\" blues number for Rae, Brewer truly manages to create almost a fantasy world, an undermined mythology to the rural Southern setting. And it works so utterly fantastically to craft Brewer's unique vision.  And one can't talk about a Craig Brewer film without mentioning the music. In Hustle & Flow, he utilized a soundtrack of down-and-dirty, street-wise hip-hop music to emphasize the atmosphere and the vision. In this film, the music works even better at polishing off and fully representing the unique atmosphere. It is a rural blues soundtrack, but it's the dirtiest, rawest, grittiest blues you've ever heard. And it sounds just absolutely fantastic.  In all, it can be said that had this movie been a simple tale of an old, broken, lonely, god-fearing black blues singer redeeming a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffers from nymphomania, there may have not been very much to write home about. But this film is not about the plot, and not even about the characters, as well as they are crafted in the film regardless. No, this film is about the vision \\u0096 and what a unique vision it is! It is about the atmosphere, the mythology, the setting. It is about anger, fear, redemption, and most importantly, the blues. And it's all wrapped up in a unique, entertaining, stylized and impeccable ribbon. Brewer has guaranteed himself a spot on the most promising up-and-coming directors list, and with such a solid follow-up to a great debut film, Hustle & Flow, he will definitely be on my radar for future projects.  It also must be mentioned that the film has one of the most fantastic and unique titles I've heard yet.\", \"As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was \\\"not very profound.\\\" I have to disagree\\u0097this has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feeling\\u0097it is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die. It is about a man seeing more value in a girl than she saw in herself. It reminded me strongly of the book Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers, which has a similar story of redemption. Yes, the images and themes are messy and sometimes shocking, but if you look close enough, you may just see yourself in these characters. Sometimes the truest things in life are not pretty, but they are real.\", \"then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.  I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man. The story had heart, and was very influential.  The music in this movie also added a nice touch. Craig Brewer mixed his style from Hustle & Flow into this movie, except took a new spin and used the Blues. His musical scenes are still at the top of the charts as far as performance scenes go by. He also has very interesting flashback scenes and just gives you an overall crazy feel during some of the more controversial scenes.  No doubt, if you liked Hustle & Flow, you will love this movie, and if you are a fan of the blues you should definitely go an see this. I give it a 9 out of 10, very interesting film, and it is extremely under rated. shame.  Go out and rent this movie.\", \"I must admit, I didn't expect this to be as good as it was. I also didn't expect Samuel L. Jackson to play slide and sing blue either.  Cinemark of Beaver County PA does this frequently. They advertise movies in the lobby, get you all excited about seeing it, and then disappoint you by not showing it...  I Expected that with such a great cast of Jackson and Ricci and even a former N'Syncer (Timberlake), that this movie would at least have shown for a week. But nay, at that time if I remember correctly MI3 was showing on 3 screens (that or some other type of supposed blockbuster).  Like Blues Brothers, and Crossroads, this movie incorporates the mystic and legend of what blues music is all about. Passion, and hard times. Religion and Sex. Hell Hounds of the past. Redemption. I mean so many elements go into the blues to make it work.  This was just a good all around story. Of course, not many people will see it cause it doesn't have pirates or swinging spiders. But it does have Samuel L. Jackson...  Think of what happens to Jacksons character from Pulp Fiction after he walks the earth and settles down and that essentially describes him to a \\\"T\\\".  Great and underrated, but aren't all the good ones like that anyway?\", \"I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end. And it's certainly not about the south, where \\\"everything is hotter,\\\" though it's set in the south and it's undeniably hot; holy smokes, even the tag-line writers didn't get the point.  Black Snake Moan is a parable about Mississippi Delta Blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they're playing about, how it heals them.  It's as though the film producers sat down with a blank slate and asked, \\\"Ok, if we were going to help people understand what the Blues are really about, what would it look like?\\\" So they set it in the rural south. Then they dream up two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town. Then, we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion (they know Jesus wants their lives, and though they respect Him, they know they can't give Him that), some violence between men and women, and lots and lots of steamy sexual images, including -- ready to go over the top? -- a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a half-naked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain. Fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, make it about a genuine blues picker, use music as the main healing element in the plot, slap clips of blues-man Son House on both ends, and Voila -- you have a modern parable about what the Blues are all about. Even the film's climax is not character conflict, but the whole town dancing steamy dances to hot, raunchy blues.  Of course, there's a bit of a dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is being healed by Lazarus' (Jackson's) homey religion and steadfastness (and don't forget the chain.) But then, we're shown the restored Rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end. Is this an expression of a restored, healthy life force, or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place? Brewer wants it both ways, but blues really is about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without unleashing either. I have my doubts.  Not for the first time, Samuel L Jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching Samuel L Jackson; the man is unbelievably good. He even picks some of his own tunes in the film, and his playing is authentic, dirty, and hot. Christina Ricci isn't usually this good, either. Granted, half her job is done by the Costume That Wasn't There and her slinky figure, but she's a marvelous combination of cynical lust, rebellion, and vulnerability; bravo to her, she's arrived. I was impressed by the country preacher, John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to assure myself that he's a professional actor and not a genuine country minister.  Parents need to be aware of what they're getting if their kids bring this one home. The language is pretty far off the charts, the first half-hour is full of graphic sex, and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film (Lazarus means well and is decent, but honestly, chaining a woman to the radiator?) Plus, Ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex; if you've got teenage boys, they'll be licking the screen halfway into the film. I don't recommend this for kids of any age. Adults only, please.  That being said, Black Snake Moan is informative and accurate about blues, folk religion, and sexual abuse, and tells a tale that's redemptive in lots of ways. It's unorthodox, but well worth the time. And, my goodness, is the sound track hot.\", \"This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.  I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect. Music is outstanding the writing is powerful and acting from everyone was brilliant.  And the DVD has some great features, including Samuel Jackson's background of learning to play guitar and feel the blues.  This movie is not for children and I even caution parents of teenagers.\", \"I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends. I was also amazed by Sam's ability to play an electric guitar and being able to sing. S Epatha Merrkensen is great as Lazarus' love interest Angela, Justin Timberlake plays Rae's boyfriend Ronnie who is underused in the film but does the best that he can to deliver a fine performance.\", \"In \\\"Black Snake Moan,\\\" writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into \\\"Happy Ending\\\" territory for my liking). And that's not to mention the archival footage of musician Son House, ruminating on love and death (and heavily foreshadowing things to come, of course). Yet in a strange way, these demerits are also qualities of \\\"Black Snake Moan,\\\" the tale of aging Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), recently dumped by his wife (for his brother, no less), who comes across near-death nympho Rae (Christina Ricci, easily giving the hottest portrayal of trailer trash on celluloid ever); nursing the girl back to health, he chains her to his radiator to overcome her demons, and hopefully redeem his own fallen self. While there is a definite prurient appeal in watching Ricci fall out of her skimpy outfits, her performance is risky and mature--not a trace of Wednesday Addams to be found, and she easily holds her own with Jackson, who personifies \\\"the blues\\\" in his portrait of a flawed, God-fearing man. While heavy-handed, the scene where Lazarus sings Rae a song in the midst of a lightning storm/blackout is compelling, as is a scene inside a jumping blues club that makes you wish you were there. The setting is strong, and a case can be made for the literal symbolism (the chain, the radiator, the strange blurry man who haunts Rae's libido) being a deliberate outgrowth of superstition and spirituality. And it is the conviction with which this spirituality is played that lends \\\"Black Snake Moan\\\" much of its strength--the committed performances of Jackson and Ricci make this a film that goes from wrenching to uplifting with, well, seamless grace. While Justin Timberlake's jealous lover is a plot contrivance I could have done without, neither he nor the sledgehammer subtlety can keep this from being a fascinatingly meditative film.\", \"I suppose this is what is called Southern Gothic.  It stars Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci, and also Justin Timberlake is featured in a role. Timberlake does good work, much to my surprise, I didn't expect it of him.  When you're lost and you can't find your way home--that's the black snake moan.  The people in this movie are definitely lost in many ways, psychologically and emotionally damaged, betrayed by those they trusted and loved and filled with a lot of pain.  Samuel L. Jackson plays a blues singer/musician--whose wife has messed around with his brother and now left him for his brother, along with aborting a child he had hoped to have with her.  Christina Ricci's character is a woman who was sexually abused when young--this has turned her into a self destructive nymphomaniac; allowing men to treat her badly.  The story lies in the intersection of these two characters lives. It is a love story, but not a sexual love story, between them--the older black man and the young white woman.  It is different from most films Hollywood grinds out.  I highly recommend it.  10 stars\", \"This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word. Yes, it's gritty, sexy, down home truth, bizarre and in-your-face real. Isn't that the best reason to see a movie? Those that get my meaning won't stay away from seeing this another week.\", \"If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie. Look for a final scene that is an unexpected evidence of a wounded person healing. Perhaps we who wonder why we wallow in the abundant profane will learn that love can be located above the loins in the heart. From the pumping pounding follow the rhythm to where where love is sacred.\", \"I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...I think she is...and I love her eyes)!! The movie is about many things...people say that is religious...people say that it's about racism...people say that is about drugs...people say that is about nymphomania...well...maybe is a little bit of all that!! But what I truly feel is that this movie has a high level of eye opening for what blues is...what it stands for...and mainly were it comes from: life...heart...pain...sorrow...and above all...spontaneous feelings!! I hope you get to see it...if you are that kind of person that likes a movie not only from the pictures or the story it tells...this is a good movie to see...if your not...well...see it anyway...cant hurt that much, and you get to see Christina Ricci acting so horny!! She's a fox!!\", \"I was surprised by how great Black Snake Moan turned out to be.Being a fan of Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson id figure id give this a try.Well when this was over I was just left stunned by how great this film truly was.I mean everything was dead-on great and very accurate for that matter.This film shows how the great director and writer Craig Brewer(who made Hustle & Flow another great film) can just take anything even something that seems ludacras and make it into this.Well, I like how it is just a good time, like its a film that just makes it there own in a good way.Also I love that it doesn't show big steroeypes of the south and how its been portrayed in things as the most repulsive place to be, but not this film it makes very accurate and because of that very reconisable.The cating in this was just phenomenal especially from Christina Ricci(who deserves an Oscar for this role), the always great Samuel L. Jackson, and even Justin Timberlake did a great job as well.Overall almost everything is great about this, and while its not everyones type of film its definitely worth a viewing from anyone who can enjoy a good time. Three Cheers For Black Snake Moan!!!!  9.3 out of 10 stars\", \"(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to fulfill her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home. Lazarus gives medical care to Rae, and believes that he can also save her from herself. Rae is like a dog in heat so Lazarus puts a 40 pound chain around her and his radiator to keep her from going out looking for men. Lazarus has problems of his own, because his wife has just left him for another man. Lazarus turns to his blues music to relieve his pain.  (My Comment) The movie has a deep meaning to it once you get past the sex and violence. The film has a different feel to it. The story is raw and almost puts you in the movie as if you were there. The 40 pound chain is a good metaphor, and symbolic of a chastity belt. You don't give love away to anyone, but you keep it for your true love. The chain could also be a parallel to a wife who is chained to the kitchen, yet Rae didn't cook. Rae only wanted to have sex all the time whereas a wife may not. I think Craig Brewer (writer & director) has made an extraordinary movie, and Samuel L. Jackson sings a mean blues song. The story is emotionally charged, tackling the subjects of race, religion, music, and sex all into one. (Paramount Classics, Run time 1:56, Rated R)(8/10)\", \"In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.  \\\"Black Snake Moan\\\" is a weird tale of faith, hope, love and blues. The gifted Christina Ricci has an impressive performance in the role of a young tramp abused since her childhood by her father and having had sex with the whole town where she lives. It is amazing the versatility of this actress, and probably this is the most mature work that I have seen Christina Ricci perform. Samuel L. Jackson has also a fantastic performance in the role of Lazarus. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful I have ever heard in a movie, with wonderful blues. My vote is eight.  Title (Brazil): \\\"Entre o C\\u00e9u e o Inferno\\\" (\\\"Between the Heaven and the Hell\\\")\", \"Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator. It is a interesting concept and one that may not settle well with everyone.  Brewer shows us the region he grew up in. Yes it is still tainted with racial problems, though worse problems exist in many metropolitan cities. This is in the subtext and not the main plot of the story. People live a more simple lifestyle, yet life is still complex and excruciating.  Jackson and Ricci do a fantastic job in this film. Jackson the aging-former blues guitarist who eeks out a living on his small farm. His wife of 12 years leaves him for his brother, so he spirals into depression. Meanwhile Ricci and Justin Timberlake have a last wild sexually charged night before he ships off to the Army. Ricci suffers from a childhood of sexual abuse, though that isn't revealed until later, her torment can only be quenched by sexual forays with various boys (Black and White) in the town.  When Ricci is beat up and left for dead on the road near Jacksons farm, he finds her and nurses her back to health. He believes it is divine intervention that this half-naked White girl is left in his care. He clutches his Bible and prays for guidance. He refuses her sexual advances and instead treats her with dignity, respect and care. Something few men in her life have ever done.  She in time sees Jackson as a man of honor and morals, yet he also carries his own pain. He plays his guitar and sings to her. Yes it's the Blues and damn good too, With the minister counseling her, she slowly understands how to deal with her childhood sexual abuse. Jackson, through Ricci's transformation, realizes he must let his own pain heal.  Justin Timberlake comes back, discharged due to \\\"anxiety problems\\\". As he searches for Ricci, who has been living with Jackson during her recovery, he finds out she has been promiscuous and unfaithful to him.  He finds her and Jackson at a bar, where Jackson has decided (as part of his healing process) to come out retirement and play the Blues again. Timberlake follows them home and confronts Jackson and Ricci.  You will have to see the movie to get the rest of the story. Should you decide to see this film, remember to look at it from the aspect of a foreign or independent movie. It is a slice of life, from a particular region of America that few of us get to see. It is interesting and revealing. It also shows us that regardless of the color of our skin, we all have similar problems that can be fixed with similar solutions.\", \"If ever a potential movie must've sounded like it wouldn't work based on reading the script on paper, it would be this one. Here we have what seemingly looks like a lurid and seedy soft-porn s&m flick, complete with the huge in-theatre poster, depicting a near-naked Christina Ricci chained to none other than Mr. Bad Ass MF himself, Samuel Jackson. But let me tell you, if ever a film springs to life on celluloid major big time with soulful power to spare, it's Craig Brewer's redemptive follow-up to Hustle & Flow, Black Snake Moan.  Unashamedly over the top from the get go, this film sucks you in with the opening scenes and proceeds to dig deeper and deeper in with every subsequent frame. It's yer basic story of two deeply damaged characters who find in each other the strength and courage to move on, in more positive ways, with their lives. Been done before, of course, this tale, but as I've always said, it's the manner in which a story is told that gives it heart, depth, meaning and power.  Ricci's damaged-by-childhood-abuse wild-child character Rae and Jackson's equally soulsick musician character Lazarus find each other under desperate circumstances, and Laz takes it upon himself to try to help Rae. This in itself is relatively unique: the idea of a man trying to genuinely help a woman who is in serious pain, rather than trying to take further advantage of her, and we know from the onset that Laz's heart, and the film's heart, is in the right place. The movie at its core is about the redemptive, healing power of love (with music as a very close second), and the film resonates profoundly with this truth - soulfully, artfully and brilliantly.  A major reason the film succeeds so profoundly is because of the fierce, committed performances from Ricci and Jackson. Scenes that would have come off as laughable and pathetic in lesser artists' hands are, instead, powerful as all get-out. In particular, the film's arc scene, in which Jackson sings and plays the song of the title alone in his house, with Ricci, amidst a serious thunderstorm and the abusive demons from Rae's past running amok inside her head, leading her to crawl to Lazarus and cling to his leg, comes off not ridiculous as technically it should, but rather as gut-wrenchingly cathartic.   All the supporting performances are fantastic here too. Justin Timberlake is completely believable as Rae's anxiety-ridden boyfriend Ronnie, and the always-wonderful S. Epatha Merkerson is also perfectly cast as a character who obviously has feelings for Lazarus. John Cothran Jr. is outstanding as well, as Laz's reverend friend R.L. (a nod to blues musician R. L. Burnside, no doubt). Everything works about this movie, let's face it, including the music/soundtrack, which features Burnside, Scott Bomar, Bobby Rush, Son House, and most importantly, Jackson himself, whose fantastic version of Stackolee I am listening to as I compose this review. There's also a really beautiful and moving version of \\\"This Little Light of Mine\\\" featured in the film, sung heart-breakingly tentative and soft by Ricci.  Samuel Jackson has said in recent interviews that he believes his performance in this movie is the best of his career thus far; I could not agree with him more. This is work that he can be monumentally proud of, along with everyone else involved in this audacious, supremely wise and deeply heartfelt mother*ucker of a project.\", \"Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on. The acting is astonishing, the writing superb, and the editing style, as well as juxtaposed music, riveting the whole way. Brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption.  The first moment I knew I was in for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning. Like he did with Hustle and Flow, Brewer lays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up statically. The 70's aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of cinema's best. From here we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both Lazarus and Rae, each vignette mirroring the other while they journey to the fateful moment their paths finally cross. The editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose. Rae's boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and Laz's wife leaves him for his brother. Each feels the loneliness and reverts to what they know in that situation\\u0097Rae to sex and Laz to the bottle. Only when Rae is left for dead at the side of the road and her savior comes from his farm to take her in does the reasoning for their actions finally start to become clear.  Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as the older bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with God and that of the flesh and the pain it has brought him. There are the moments of stoic sternness as well as those of kindheartedness with his captive/patient. You never really look at the setup as comical or unrealistic because he sells what he is doing so well. Also, the character of Rae is not chained up for very long, despite what the trailers would have you believe. The situation starts a bit awkward until we see that the chaining was for her own good and is actually used for only a day or two. As for that chained girl, Christina Ricci really shines. I never really saw her as anything special, but this role is a true breakthrough for her. This girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has scarred her very deep down. Any time she is away from her love she starts seeing flashes of the man who took her childhood innocence away and itches to be touched by any man available to let the image go away. Her nymphomania is not for pleasure, but rather for survival from the haunting nightmares always hiding behind her eyelids. Ricci fully inhabits the role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism. Mention must also be made of Justin Timberlake, again showing some real acting talent. Where this guy came from I have no clue, but hopefully he will continue taking more films and steer away from the mostly crap music he churns out.  While not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan still ranks equally to it, in my mind, because when it is on, it is spectacular. Towards the end we have a truly enthralling sequence with \\\"This Little Light of Mine\\\" singing out, and earlier, the interaction between captive and captor, when the chain is first introduced, shows some top-notch work. The truly magical moment, though, is when Jackson sings (yes that is him throughout, like it was Terrence Howard in Hustle) the titular song while a thunderstorm roars and the lights flicker. If I don't see a more beautifully shot sequence all year, I won't be surprised. What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of. One thing I think I really enjoy with Brewer's work is the fact that he doesn't show sinners becoming redeemed heroes. Instead he shows us that no matter how bad you have been, or how bad life has been, everyone can strive for redemption and to be better people. We don't have saints here, but fallible people looking to right their ship. If the course stays true or if it falls back into darkness, no one really knows, but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could.\", \"I knew as soon as I saw the first trailer for Black Snake Moan that I would have to see it. I was not disappointed in the slightest in the film, which was written and directed by Hustle and Flow's creator Craig Brewer. It tells the story of a broken blues man and the nymphomaniac he aims to cure not just for her sake, but also his own...yet it's so much more than that. It's complex and rich and it manages to steep you in a gritty, sticky, sultry blue Memphis without making you feel like you need a bath afterward.  The characters are (for the most part) multifaceted and very well-written and performed. The accents and the dialogue were carried off flawlessly. However, there was one weak link in the chain: Justin Timberlake. The best I can say for him is that he can pull off crying...it's a rare male actor who can cry convincingly. However, Justin's Ronnie was flat, but as an actor he was trying very hard. I would definitely give him another chance.  Lazarus and Rae (Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci respectively) have a great chemistry and a great respect for each other. This is one of those films where it doesn't matter how good one actor is if the other one isn't up to the task and, luckily, both of the actors were up to the task.  The music was very bit as good as you would expect, especially when Mr. Samuel L. Jackson sings the blues. Phenomenal.  On the technical side, all was brilliance as far as I could see. It was well-edited, well shot, and well-mixed...everything was great. The character and set designs were just right, the casting of the supporting characters (even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards) was spot on... Loved it.\", \"If you've been looking for a film where a out of control nympho gets chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man then look no further than Paramount Vantage's latest release 'Black Snake Moan'. Not exactly looking for what I just described you say? Well then, you best get ya wits 'bout yaself and mosey on down to your local theater and still see it as Samuel L. Jackson's character Lazarus would say. As long as you're open minded and don't take everything seriously, there's no reason you won't leave the theater glad you saw it.  In the third offering from director Craig Brewer, we are taken into the deep south where as the tagline to the film claims, everything is hotter. While there we're introduced to the Godfearing bluesman, Lazarus as previously said played by Jackson, and the almost always half naked Rae; a role bravely taken on by Christina Ricci. In the film this unlikely pair cross paths long enough for their characters to each learn a lesson from one another. Both lessons ultimately convey the message to us the audience that no matter what, we are all human. No one is perfect and if everyone would realize that, then we'd be a lot better off. The question of if this will be understood, or be accepted by all who see the film is another story.  One thing not up for debate is how great Jackson and Ricci both are here. You'd think with the role of a sex-crazed woman, overacting would be a given, but no, not here. Ricci breaks through and demonstrates true talent with a raw performance that also doubles as her best to date. Then we have Jackson who completely disappears and for the first time in a long time makes us forget who he even is. Sadly, the third star of the film, Justin Timberlake who plays Rae's military-bound boyfriend isn't all that great. At the start, he fails miserably as he appears to be trying too hard. Later on he steps it up some, still he's far from the level he reached in January's 'Alpha Dog'.  The other thing 'Black Snake Moan' boasts is a splendid soundtrack. Containing tracks from The Black Keys, John Doe, pieces from the score done by Scott Bomar, & of course four, count 'em, four tracks from Jackson himself. It's actually one of his songs, the main performance of the film, 'Stackolee' that is the fuel to the fire of this great collection. It alone is worth the ticket price. Other notable musical delights from the soundtrack are Bomar's 'The Chain', 'When the Lights Go Out' from the Black Keys, & the title track which is also among the most memorable scenes in the film where Lazarus sings to Rae on a stormy night.  The efforts of Craig Brewer can't go without mention though. His last film 'Hustle & Flow' which ended up surpassing low expectations and gaining critical acclaim put him on the map. What he has done with 'Black Snake Moan' will be what sets him apart from other newbies to the industry. He not only directed 'Moan', but also wrote its screenplay. The end result is a story that is surprising and clever. As you watch you feel like you know exactly where it's headed despite its valiant composure. Just as you think you've predicted the next move Brewer shifts gears and takes an entirely different route. There are however some blotches within the screenplay. The background characters are drab and flat while the ending is somewhat disappointing. It left me craving for something more exciting. After so many highs I guess the final scenes were a tad weak compared to the rest of the film.  I imagine the majority of people who see 'Black Snake Moan' won't enjoy it due to the fact they won't be able to stop themselves from thinking how unlikely the situations are. The depressing part about that is there are many other films with just as unlikely, even more outrageous scenarios that are widely well received. It's the issues of race, religious motives, & sexuality the film exhibits that will have more effect on opinion than anything. The idea of a black man chaining a white woman up in his house is enough to make most people not even consider seeing it. Simply put, it's not for everyone. Like I said, to fully enjoy it you have to go in with an open mind, or else you're just wasting your money. For those of you who can do that, I highly recommend it.\", \"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the \\\"Black Snake Moan\\\" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song. Christina Ricci does a great job and is thoroughly convincing in her role, as is Samuel L Jackson. I think this is his best performance since his role in Pulp Fiction, and probably his best including that because of the range of his character in BSM. The rest of the cast is solid, with a few shining performances here and there, particularly John Cothran Jr as Reverend R. L.. I'm a very selective movie watcher, and this film honestly rates among my favorites because of its candid look at race, sex, religion and neurosis in a rural southern town, along with its cinematic genius, in my opinion.\", \"Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.  It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it. If it tried to take itself seriously, it would have failed miserably, but instead it carries itself through humor (some unintentional) and some surprisingly good acting by Ricci. Although Timberlake fails miserably in his role, the movie is good enough for you to put that on the side.  I would definitely recommend this movie, if not for any other reason than the fact it is something different to experience.\", \"Just got back from seeing Black Snake Moan. I had spent time reading reviews ... most seemed to focus on the obvious ... \\\"skinny white girl chained to a black man's radiator\\\" ... I hate when \\\"critics\\\" miss the point of a film. Now I suppose it helps that I live in Memphis ... and have lived in Mississippi a couple of times too. It may also help that I am the former Director of the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale ... but I get this movie. Brewer's simple \\\"redemption tale\\\" is easy to follow and could have had various themes to tell the story ... but I believe it is highly effect as a \\\"blues\\\". It would be my hope that people don't read all the hype ... and/or various reviews ... and miss a really good movie. Get past the various things like skinny girls in white panties ... get past Justin Timberlake, accept his character Ronnis (which he plays very well) ... get past \\\"Snakes on a Plane\\\" and see how mercuricul Samuel L. Jackson is ... as he has transformed himself into a very believable Mid-South blues man. If you know little about Mid-South culture a lot of what goes on may strike some as cartoonish ... but accept the fact that Craig Brewer KNOWS how to paint the canvas and let the actors tell the story and you will enjoy this film. Not one to tell endings ... so go see this movie ... and yes I will agree with one thing the critics got right ... the music is wonderful!\", \"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, \\\"Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie\\\". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie. It tells the story of an older man and young woman who are both going through rough times and are able to reach out to one another. The story is truly touching and sends out a great message about life and how we live. Of course, I do not recommend it for young audiences due to some graphic material, but if you are looking for a great story and genuine acting from Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and,yes, even Justin Timberlake, I encourage you to see 'Black Snake Moan'.\", \"We just saw this film previewed before release at the Norfolk (VA) Film Forum, and there was general agreement on two matters: There were excellent performances in a first rate drama by the two leads and by others: and secondly, the marketing for this movie will only bring disaster. We saw a lurid poster with chains and suggestive commentary implying some sort of wacko sexual relationship between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci, whereas the movie has some real depth and some thoughtful ideas. What's sad is that people looking for near porn will be drawn in to see the film and will be disappointed because it will be too \\\"heavy\\\" for them, while the people who would really enjoy it wouldn't be caught dead walking into the theater showing it.

The best movies are the ones that make you think about about their message afterward (debate over the premises and conclusion) or the movies that tell their story in a captivating way; Boondock Saints did none of that. It was built up to be just like a Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs but it doesn't come close to those two classics. This movie's underlying message, if universalized, is \\\"anyone who is perceived as bad should be killed in the name of God\\\"; seems to be the same logic that any terrorist would use. It's sick to think that people condone the killing that occurs in this movie. A person may try to argue that any superhero acts in this way but a spiderman, batman, or superman all help people that need it at that time; they also never execute people.\", \"This movie was recommended to me by a couple friends. It was vehemently endorsed by other friends. So I rented this movie at their insistence. I no longer wish to speak to these people. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Little to nothing of the plot was believable. The casting was horrible. The acting was worse, and worst of all...   *spoiler*   Willem Defoe dressing up like a woman at the end to help the \\\"saints\\\" could be the worst moment in cinematic history. Any acclaim he has ever received from any other role should be retracted because of his awful portray in this film.   If you haven't seen this movie, don't. If you have, please tell me how best to forget this awful movie experience.\", \"Really, watch something else.  I can get down with action films... but this one is just a bit too ~hardcore~ for its own good.  I know, in a film, you're supposed to suspend your disbelief, but when is enough enough? The rooftop jumping, toilet dropping scene is proof enough for this.  If the goal of these two Catholic boys was to destroy those who were considered \\\"bad\\\" in the eyes of God, why did they not kill Willem Dafoe's character, seeing as homosexuality isn't accepted in the eyes of God, especially by the Catholic church?  I'm wondering why Willem Dafoe even entertained this script. Maybe he bought too much junk on eBay and needed some cash. Maybe he just wanted to wear that pretty dress some place. I don't know.  I do know, though, that we now make fun of the guy who loaned it to us.  And he'll never hear the end of it.\", \"I suppose I can see how so many people could've been hoodwinked into thinking this was a good movie. It just piles a bunch of \\\"cool\\\" imagery and ideas together and flings them onto the screen. \\\"Boondock Saints\\\" is one of the more shallow bits of cinema to cross my path in a while. The twins are fantastic shots when hanging upside down from twisted rope while spinning and wearing ski masks. But line them up in front of one man in broad daylight and they're lucky to escape with their lives. Speaking of shallow cool and that particular gunfight... It looks cool when a man opens his overcoat to reveal a vest with 6 holsters, each containing a badass looking handgun in slow-motion. So while he's constantly running out of bullets and, lightning-quick, whipping out a new gun, the twins have their divine guns that never need to be reloaded. That's one of the main problems with this movie, it can't decide if it's going to be one of those \\\"reload during a gunfight\\\" flicks or a \\\"just keep shooting and never run out of bullets\\\" flicks. Just when you think the movie's going to laugh at itself (\\\"THERE WAS A FIREFIGHT!!!!!!!), it actually shows you that it doesn't get its own joke.  As far as the murky morality goes, it wants to come across as leaving the judgement as to whether the twins are right or wrong to the viewer. But the camera and the script love these Irish rogues a little too much. Lingering on their nakedness, their wicked grins, and their righteousness a little too long.  Willem Dafoe is a great actor and he does his best with the unfortunate script. But behind every great actor is a great director and Dafoe's performance makes me think Duffy was never there to reign in Dafoe's fantastic imagination and energy.  Finally, I can understand the need for Rocco's character; the twins need a spaz around so they look even cooler by comparison. But did the actor have to suck SO MUCH?\", \"Tries to be as cool as pulp fiction and as funny as dogma.  Fails both.  Does not try to find to a climax... And doesn't find it.  Uses some interesting ideas already dealt with in other movies. I could not find something special or new in this film.  The plot is predictable most of the time. The dialogs are trying to use a lot of bad words, trying to be cool, but are neither cool nor funny.  All in all nothing more than a poor story and mostly poor actors. For me this is one of the worst movies I saw this year and I wonder how it could get that high score on IMDb.\", \"Hopefully no young people will ever see this horribly bad movie. My friends and I could hardly stop laughing throughout this dim-witted movie. This is a movie that appeals to disgusting bottom-feeders. You can tell that the person who wrote it never graduated high school.  The acting is sooo bad. Willem Defoe, listening to music, while walking around the crime scene, at the beginning of the movie, was almost worth seeing this garbage: You will laugh so hard your stomach will hurt. Actually, there's another crime scene investigation, almost as funny as the first: Defoe gets so worked up that he sweats, tears his shirt and fires his gun in the air- AT A CRIME SCENE! My friends and I laughed so hard we were all crying. It was so bad.  Even the action scenes are so ridiculous that people stand in plain view, 15 feet away of each other, shoot for 30 seconds straight and no one gets shot! Also the 'saints/nazis' walk in to a courthouse with guns by throwing the bag that's carrying them over a metal detector! It's so stupid that it's hilarious!  The writing is horrible! You can tell that troy duffy isn't a very intelligent person. He believes...get this (LOL!): that having people go around killing drug dealers, etc, is a good thing! He obviously has never read any books on poverty or crime. As I mentioned earlier, there's a scene where they walk into a courthouse... Well, this movie is so dumb that the 'saints/nazis' kill the accused BEFORE the verdict is even read!! I'm laughing even as I write this!  Ok, on the theme: I'll get serious for a second and say that this movie would be supported by neo-nazis. They'd love the message in this film.  That's one of the main reasons why I think this is one of the worst movies ever made. Don't let anyone tell you that this movie is anything like Pulp Fiction- IT ISN'T.  I'll state again that is movie is FASCIST. It is targeted for bottom-feeding low-lives.\", \"This film serves a great purpose: whenever someone tells me that they love Boondock Saints, I feel justified in ignoring everything else they have to say about cinema. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. The only people that have ever said anything positive about this movie have been highschoolers that don't know anything about cinema.  This movie isn't entertaining to me, but that's a subjective claim. This movie also happens to be completely unoriginal. It's about vigilante justice (70s crime movies anyone? Dirty Harry? French Connection? They all do it better.). It's about Irish-Catholic violence in Boston (even though it came afterwards, Gangs of New York portrays this theme more powerfully). It has characters marked with meaningful tattooes (Belly, Memento). It includes a cross-dressing detective (David Duchovny in Twin Peaks? What was that, 15 years earlier?). It depicts prayers before murder (Godfather Trilogy, Pulp Fiction). This movie was so unremarkable and derivative that I can't even remember more things to criticize.  On a final note, it's just not a cool movie. The things that the filmmakers and the appreciative audiences think are cool are just not. The violence is sluggishly portrayed. The gay detective is just a caricature of an emphatic queen (unlike Gay Perry in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). The whole movie sucks. There is nothing to like about this that hasn't been done a million times better in other films.\", \"The Boondock Saints is so incredibly bad, I eventually embraced it with a sick fascination, watching as it ripped off so many of my favorite movies (\\\"Oh, I remember that form that Tarantino, Rodriguez, Woo, Ritchie, Stone, Scorcese Movie!\\\"). I almost don't know where to begin, so I'll start with the one scene that I liked. It was between Willem Dafoe and a priest in confessional as Dafoe struggles with his conscience. It was surprisingly well written and well acted and is the only redeeming scene in the whole film, to be honest.  The fact that this movie blatantly steals scenes from other, better movies is not what makes it so bad (but now that I think of it, stealing is one of the crimes that is punishable by death according to the Saints. We should be so lucky). No, what makes Boondock Saints bad is that it does such a poor job of ripping them off. John Woo might consider dying early so he can start spinning in his grave. I can practically see him taking a razor to his own wrist during the laughable shoot-out between the Saints and Billy Connelly (that's right, I said Billy Connelly). Woo might say something like, \\\"What have I wrought? The horror, the horror!\\\" right before his arterial spray covered his big screen television. Another tragic, Boondock Saints related death.  You might find yourself asking certain questions while watching this movie. Fear not, for I have the answers you seek! For example you might say to yourself, how are these guys with so good at killing when they have no experience and their basic attack plans involve standing in the center of rooms surrounded by bad guys with only a handgun in each paw and some cool sunglasses. That's easy - It's obvious that they've seen John Woo films and know that a guy firing two guns at once looks too damn cool to get killed, and because all these scenes are in unnecessary slow motion shots it gives them plenty of time to dodge the bullets. Another question you might ask is why is the Willem Dafoe character gay when it's obvious that writer/director Troy Duffy knows even less about gay people than I do? What a silly question. It's so that Duffy can have ridiculous scenes where Dafoe prances around crime scenes while listening to CDs on his portable disc player as if he were conducting an orchestra instead of gathering evidence. So he can include clever scenes of Dafoe calling his lover a fag because he wants to cuddle and saying something similar to a bartender at a gay bar. See, he's a macho homosexual. He's a rebel. He doesn't play by the rules, and he sure as hell doesn't cuddle. Oh, and we must not forget the scene where Dafoe dresses up as a blond prostitute so he can infiltrate the mob's headquarters. I would have liked to see how this movie played in San Francisco. I can picture men turning to the person next to them and saying, \\\"We don't act like that, do we?\\\" Why do they say a prayer before whacking the bad guys? Don't you know anything? It's because they've seen Pulp Fiction, only Samuel L. Jackson's character was more honest about his motivations for quoting the Bible.  Some random complaints I have - an extremely poor attempt at capturing the randomness, shock and surprise of Vincent Vega and Marvin's \\\"explosive\\\" conversation in the back of Jules' car in Pulp Fiction. A little of Rocko goes a long way, and I felt cheated when he wasn't given a slow, painful death. It would be my guess that Rocko's command of the english language is not the greatest as he seems to only know about fifty words, half of which begin with \\\"F\\\" and end in \\\"K\\\". How did Billy Connelly become such a feared hitman when his method of whacking a guy involves standing in the middle of the street in broad daylight with a bunch of guns under his trench coat and waiting to be seen before firing. This could only seem like an ambush to the Saints, probably thinking, \\\"Why didn't we think of that?\\\" Rocko's extremely old and lame joke that grinds the movie to a dead halt. And the list goes on.  Those wacky Weinstien brothers - when they're not frequenting bars looking for the next Quintin Tarantino or Kevin Smith, they're buying Oscars (I'll never forgive them for robbing Saving Private Ryan of Best Picture). Guys, stick to what you know best. The money spent making this film would have been better spent on the catering budget on the next Scream film. Someone really has to feed Courtney Cox. Apparently lack of food has made her dizzy and she accidentally married David Arquette. Someone get her a Twinkie, STAT! But I digress. This movie is a terrible waste of time. It was recommended to me by some young crack addicts who thought it was the greatest film ever made. But that seems to be the general consensus regarding this film. People love it. So I guess that makes me wrong this time, does it? No, that can't be it. Everyone else is wrong, I'm right. 2/10 stars for this turkey. G'night!  \", \"Quite possibly the most overrated film of all time; maybe even the worst film of all time. Far from the great streetsmart action film that it is praised to be, Boondock Saints is a severely banal and contradictory film that contains poor acting, poor accents and even poorer performances. From the two brothers who are flawed, contradicted and pathetic characters, who are in the movie to tote guns and sport bible lines all to a hip soundtrack and Troy DUffy's pathetically uninteresting vision. THis movie is sacrificed to be what it became- pure Hollywood movie-making; produced only to make money and look entertaining, filled with archetypes where everything leads to something else, with no point and no vision. THe film reaches its sad low-point when Dafoe's uselessly gay character (why? why is he gay?) lets the killers go, because, well, we just don't know. That and the fact that their dad joins in the cause. THe whole movie sums it up; we don't know. And it sucks.\", \"I hate this movie. Not just dislike, but hate. And trust me, this is an exclusive category. A blow-hard named Troy Duffy, who fancied himself to be much more clever than he actually is and whose knowledge of cinema stretched back only roughly ten years, decided to try his hand at a Tarantino-like action flick, except on a smaller scale. Even more pale in comparison than the budget however is the talent involved. Duffy has no skill as a screenwriter or director. For some inexplicable reason, this has gained a huge cult following among undiscriminating teenage boys who are unfamiliar with roughly sixty years of crime cinema. Hopefully the next generation sees this for the crap it is.  Why do I hate this film? Mainly, its the most vapid attempt at aping Tarantino I've seen, and thats saying a lot. Duffy forgets that action isn't what made \\\"Reservoir Dogs\\\" great, but the characters and dialog. Duffy attempts to fashion quirky characters with witty dialog, but doesn't have either the intelligence or cleverness needed. So he loads the film with much violence, which becomes repetitive fast. Secondly, the gay detective character. Willem Dafoe can be amazing, but this is an alarmingly one-note portrayal (he does what he can with the horrible material). It wasn't daring for Duffy to include an non-stereotypical gay character in a mindless action flick, because the character's homosexuality is simply used to shock the audience who didn't see it coming. In my mind, its as offensive as \\\"Boat Trip\\\". Finally, the fan base. If this film didn't have the huge cult following, I'd just simply think this a bad film and nothing more. However, the films mindless fans seem to worship it because they're unfamiliar with the material Duffy blatantly rips off. The film was hyped up as one of the coolest action films ever made, but honestly I don't see much difference between it and the rest of the Steven Segal / Jean-Claude Van Damme direct to video crap. Instead, check out \\\"Overnight\\\", which is a compelling documentary that shows Duffy for the unappealing and moronic individual he is. Or better yet, just watch a Tarantino film instead. Whatever you do, avoid \\\"The Boondock Saints\\\". (1/10)\", \"I forced myself to travel far and fork up $5 to see this film on the sole basis that it was shot in Boston (the world's greatest city) and the great story behind the writer/director, Troy Duffy (an ex-New England bartender, he apparently pitched \\\"Boondock\\\" to a producer/patron and the rest is Hollywood history). I'm sorry I made the effort. Tip to Duffy: Tarantino excelled in ripping-off dozens of films by twisting them into new, more exciting cinema - you, on the other hand, have ripped-off Tarantino, \\\"The Professional\\\" and \\\"Things to do in Denver When You're Dead\\\"...and very, very, very badly. I was terribly bored. If I were Troy Duffy, I'd be asking for that bartender job back real quick.\", \"Pros: Good visuals; decent soundtrack; good general idea for a movie.  Cons: Utter cr*p for a script; very bad acting overall with only few exceptions; laughable, pathetic characters; illogical, predictable, stupid.  I can't believe action movies can get THIS bad these days. The idiotic excuse-for-a-script serves only two purposes: some excuse for on-screen violence and the use of the f-word as pretty much the only verb the \\\"characters\\\" use in their communication. Is this supposed to be funny or have some \\\"deeper meaning\\\" or something? Compared to the others in the genre -- \\\"Pulp Fiction\\\", \\\"Reservoir Dogs\\\", \\\"Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels\\\", \\\"Natural Born Killers\\\", \\\"Dobermann\\\", \\\"Dogma\\\" -- this one is an unbelievable pile of garbage and a real PAIN to sit through. Do not even bother to rent.  p.s. A Russian mafia boss with a surname of Pavlova? Heck, why didn't they just name him Mary-Ann?\", \"this movie was remarkably unintelligent, and a waste of time. all it was was a bunch of guns blasting all over the place, and ppl yelling out the f-word and ranting and raving about who to go kill next... and a gay transvestite cop, who was also an idiot (dafoe). it tries so hard to be all stylish and cool (with the irish brothers always reciting a prayer before they pump rounds into the back of someone's head, amongst other things), but fails miserably... well, okay, i suppose i have seen worse movies, but this one was pretty bad.\", \"A friend has been insisting for over a year that I see this movie. I finally shelled out my hard earned money and all I can wonder is why bother? It's quite surprising that this film scored a 7.6 out of 10 with viewers. Director Troy Duffy is a film buff but the quality of this work is lacking. The main problem that I have with this film is the meandering plot. The script wanders aimlessly from one incident to the next without any real plot development. The conventional use of flashbacks and slow motion become rather mundane. After the first 10 minutes of the film I began the elaborate process of matching scenes from the Boondock Saints to other films. I think that director Troy Duffy should really consider the script for his next work and ditch the cinematic pitfalls that plague this film. Character and plot development will go a lot further than the use of the F-word 50 times in one scene. After a while it just becomes tiresome. The film ended with some rather interesting faux documentary interviews with the typical man on the street. Unfortunately, as the saying goes, it was too little too late. If you want to see a film that deals with the same subject matter then rent Leon: The Professional. Don't waste yr time with The Boondock Saints.\", \"A friend recommended this film to me and so a group of us got together to watch it. Not understanding that Dafoe was gay at first and then realizing in hilarity that he was, I laughed my way through this absurd attempt at a good independent film. The casting of Ron Jeremy in any role in this film immediately diminished any legitimate value it held. I especially like the need for a Ron Jeremy sex scene, (give him something he knows guys, don't let him stretch his characters beyond porn). There are too many horridly overacted Willam Dafoe scenes to recall, and for this reason I figured it was made early in his career. 1999! Less than five years after the English patient (though four, after speed 2) it is so sad to see a good actor acting badly in such a ridiculous film. Willam Dafoe has had a rollercoaster career of inspiring roles and hilarious flops. The sad part is that, (I imagine) Dafoe and the makers of this film thought they were doing something truly important. Save this stuff for film school, and Willem...I'm disappointed.\", \"After reading handfuls of good reviews on this site, and then reading many comments that said the bad reviews are wrong, I sought out to purchase this film. Big mistake. The negative reviews are a spot-on match. The acting itself is horrible, and the plot makes no sense. The whole premise of the movie is that these brothers or \\\"saints\\\" are trying to rid the streets of evil. Now it is easy to understand if you kill innocent people, that is wrong, but what about going to a strip club? Is that evil too? I don't want to be judged by two brothers cracked out on a power hungry drunken binge. How does this make sense for all of the fans? I seem to recall one of the commandments that states something like \\\"thou shalt not kill\\\" well then these brothers must have slept through that part of their heavily religious upbringing. I don't know what all these people are thinking that rate the movie so highly, it is awful.\", \"This is a piece of crap. The only people that would like it are children with no film knowledge. The acting is so bad it's laughable... I mean, Ron Jeremy is in it... enough said.  Don't waste your time... if you want to save yourself time just smear poop on your TV screen... it's much quicker.  The directing isn't that terrible, but the writing and acting are like a student film. actually they are worse than a student film... when i was in film school people actually knew what they were doing. what the hell was Willem Defoe thinking? well... at least he was smart enough not to appear in the sequel.  This movie sucks.\", \"Like Alfred Hitchcock's \\\"Psycho,\\\" \\\"Pulp Fiction\\\" is a great film. This movie is to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs what \\\"Slumber Party Massacre 2\\\" is to Psycho. It is a sad attempt to remake the whole \\\"cool and tough criminals kill bad guys in a really cool and tough fashion while saying cool and tough one-liners\\\" genre. Unfortunately, it lacks all originality and the script is far from clever. Every character is one-dimensional; the so-called organized criminals are just a bunch of morons who get slaughtered in their hundreds by two meat packers from Southie. Meanwhile, entire scenes are lifted from Pulp Fiction: the cat accidentally being killed (paralleling Marvin's unfortunate fate in Pulp Fiction), the bible quotes before executions, and the constant oh-so-cleverly random conversations that don't come close to stuff Tarantino probably wrote in Grade school. By the way, the acting sucks. Finally, the message that it's good for vigilantes to kill the brainless ethnic stereotypes that pass for mafiosi in this movie (as well as random guys at a strip club; I guess they're criminal scum as well) whenever they feel like it will appeal to armchair suburbanites scared of those big city lowlifes whom they've heard about on the news--it will seem ludicrous to anyone else. Skip this and throw on \\\"Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver\\\"... or practically anything else you can think of.\", \"This intelligent, crafty, dark comedy is a breath of fresh air. Though not completely original, this movie really works. The story centers around 2 Irish brothers (fraternal twins), who wake up while spending the night in a prison cell, and are \\\"chosen\\\" to take out God's vengeance on bad guys.  What develops is an excellent dark comedy/drama that explodes from the first frame till the last. Quick, fast paced camera work and excellent photography helps to move the story along. The action is non-stop and the dialogue, though very \\\"offensive\\\" (alot of the \\\"f\\\" word), is right on target for the setting and mood of the movie.  The showdown at the end is a little less intense then the rest of the movie, but still, nonetheless, works!  The relationship between the two brothers is right on. Flannery and Remmus really do act like 2 brothers (the fighting in the air shaft, hilarious).  One of the main highlights of the movie is the performance given by Willem Dafoe. Diverse, witty, and totally hilarious. He delivers and excellent performance as the FBI agent. He is intelligent, comical, gay, and doesn't want to admit it right off the top, but agrees with what the brothers are doing. He had me laughing throuh the film...and seeing him in Drag...Oh, you just gotta see this movie.  Though some plot points weren't totally developed, (what happened to \\\"F**k Ass?), this movie is still an excellent example of a lower budget movie that really kicks ass, and offers a fast paced, action packed joy ride.  Check this movie out...It is well worth the time. I would like to get the DVD, and watch all the extra's that are on it. I would also like to get my hands on an uncut version.  9 out of 10\", \"I have so many friends who love this movie. I've heard numerous people claim it as one of their favorites. Am I crazy? Am I missing something?... No, I am not crazy. The Boondock Saints is not a movie. Its like a boy band. If it looks like a movie and it sounds like a movie then it must be a movie right? But its not. Its wrong. Its not even an \\\"unwatchably bad\\\" movie like PCU or Mystery Men or Dogma. Its noise. Just noise. It's a nothing. An empty void. To \\\"enjoy\\\" the experience of watching the Boondock Saints is Madness. Astronomically irrelevant like a monkey humping a football unfathomable Madness... and he's making another one.\", \"I can't believe people actually take this movie seriously. This has got to be one of the out and out dumbest films I've ever seen, if not ever made. Willem Dafoe prancing about to classical music, unbelievably stupid gunfights, horrible dialogue, Willem Dafoe cross-dressing. This is really a heap of garbage. And I love bad movies. In fact I like watching you're average B-movie trash more than the boring mainstream crap put out by the big studios. But, this movie is incredibly bad. If it was regarded as a \\\"so bad its good\\\" movie, I would praise it up and down. But, to watch it in the context of your friends telling you that it is a legitimate good film makes it one of the worst pieces of junk ever. I seriously can't believe that many of my own friends, who otherwise have good taste, consider this a good film. This is crap, and that's all it is.\", \"*A lot of Spoilers*  Almost all of my friends told me to watch this movie. \\\"It's so sick\\\", \\\"Great Movie\\\", \\\"It's so badass\\\", and \\\"It is in a category of it's own\\\"... well, I can honestly say that \\\"The Boondock Saints\\\" was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and had it not been for Willem Dafoe, it would have easily been the worst movie of all time. (A title currently held by both The Exorcist II and The Amityville Horror). This movie is crap, there is no way around it. The cult status it has climbed to is baffling. The fact that many people enjoy this movie is beyond the realm of human comprehension. I cannot understand. It has a lousy story line, and it doesn't gel or make sense. The action is GARBAGE. I don't care what anyone says, it blows. Its cheesy, dull and anticlimactic... Half of the \\\"action\\\" is bad quick-cut scenes zooming in on aftermath, or shots of people shooting up a storm. For some reason people can't seem to shoot each other from ten feet away, and while dangling upside-down in a room full of gangsters, these jerks kept their bearings and shot up the joint, killing almost 10 mobsters (How can they shoot so well? why can't mobsters shoot? what was holding up the rope?). Why were they so smart? why did they pack meat for a living if they could speak multiple languages? How come he didn't die after jumping off a building at least 5 stories high into an alley? What the hell was the writer thinking? The acting, with the exception of Willem Dafoe (why did he have to crossdress? honestly...), was ghastly. The Irish accents were brutal, and the overdone villains were just as horrendous. The whole \\\"we're catholic, but we execute Mobsters\\\" thing was also swill. The prayer being spoken in unison was so lame!! Who writes this crap? The whole symmetric action shots of them lighting cigarettes, praying, shooting, etc. were so corny I was ashamed of myself for watching, and I was hoping nobody would come into the room and watch... I would have been reprimanded for watching such trash. The accents from the \\\"Saints\\\" were like a poor man's Mickey, from \\\"Snatch\\\"...a good movie. This movie is so flawed, so cheesy, and so boring I was shocked after I watched it. Also, another atrocity is that its being compared to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. How dare someone make that comparison? Those movies are masterpieces, with good actors, excellent dialogue, perfect direction, fitting music (this movie had the worst music I think I've ever heard in a film) and reasonable story lines. This movie was the polar opposite of that. Irish people should be appalled by this... anyone from Boston should be appalled by this... every person on the face of the earth should be appalled by this. What gets me the most is the alienation that people who don't like this movie feel. They become outcasts in the conversation... I Just don't get it... we need more movies like Commando, Terminator, Aliens, Rambo, Cliffhanger, or Predator... hell, even Marked for Death or Cobra (that's right, 1986 Sly Stallone) is better than this. Its a sad day when people think that Matrix movies and this refuse are excellent action films. Shed a tear for a near dead genre. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, unless you want to watch it in order to make a subsequent film look really good. \\u00bd star/ 5. This movie is on par with Jaws 4 and Barb Wire... despicable... May god have mercy on Troy Duffy's soul.\", \"This was like finishing one of those paint by number kits and calling it \\\"art\\\". Every character completely contrived and unrealized. Plus the obvious inconsistencies were so annoying. Case in point - one moment the twins can knock off nine mobsters hanging from a rope upside down and the next they can't hit the broadside of a barn in the shootout with Il Duce. Then Il Duce turns out to be daddy! And the way the director condescends to his audience is a joke. Wanna see how all of the dead bodies got to be that way? Wait a minute and I will will show you. Can't come up with any original dialog? No problem. Use the F-word 200+ times. Dreadful.\", \"I guess it'll take a while for the effect to where off. I saw the unrated edition of \\\"The Boondock Saints\\\" two days ago and I'm still reeling in from the experience, which is surreal, to tell you the truth. Quite frankly, a movie that is this sharply written, acted, and directed is a true rarity these days. Writer-director Troy Duffy dives into the murkiest depths of the \\\"law,\\\" and its apparent futility in modern times, and how it takes two Irish fraternal twin brothers, Conner and Murphy (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus - both of whom are a little too convincing in their roles), to stir up enough debate about vigilantism to become media heroes. The release of \\\"The Boondock Saints\\\" was sidelined in 1999 because of the Columbine massacre and the plot about Conner and Murphy being on a mission from God draws some eerie parallels to the motives of Columbine killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. As the film opens in Boston after St. Patrick's Day, Conner and Murphy get into a bar-room brawl with a couple of Russian toughs and said toughs are discovered the next morning in an alley in piles of their own blood and guts. FBI agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) shows up on the scene to show the local cops a thing or two about criminology and theorizes it was a revenge killing. Soon enough, both injured brothers waltz into the police station and claim self-defense. They're let off after a night in jail (plus experience a cathartic jail-cell baptism) and no charges filed. But soon, more bodies turn up, and Smecker learns that Conner and Murphy (and a third, David Della Rocco) may be the ones behind the mayhem on the streets. Duffy's film is a bloody one (most of the gruesome violence is extended in the unrated special edition), with a cackling screenplay that includes 246 uses of the f-word and assorted Irish-Euro-slang, and has earned a fearsome reputation in recent years and has been embraced as a cult phenomenon. (It's easy to see why, if one is a fan of relentless violence and bloodshed. P.S.: The action is so balletic in its style and excess that it's almost reminiscent of a John Woo picture.) I can't believe I stood away from this movie for so long, darn it! The opening moments don't prepare you for what comes up next and even though the action (which there is quite a bit of and, as stated earlier, is extended in the unrated version) is quite bloody, there's a morbid sense of humor running throughout the carnage and I fell out laughing on more than one occasion during this picture. And still, there is a sense of beauty and tragedy underlying much of the action in \\\"The Boondock Saints,\\\" and its ending will certainly leave a bitter taste in the mouths of some. Lastly, I would recommend reading up on as much about the controversy surrounding \\\"The Boondock Saints\\\" as one possibly can; it'll make the experience much more hypnotic.  10/10\", \"I've always enjoyed non-linear storytelling. A number of people seem to have picked up on this aspect of the movie and thus dubbed it similar to Pulp Fiction (though no one mentions Reservoir Dogs) when this movie takes non-linear storytelling to a level beyond where Quentin Tarrantino was ever able to go.  Now, certainly Memento came along afterwards and transformed the entire art of non-linear storytelling. However, Memento uses it to keep the movie watcher guessing until the very end, whereas Boondock Saints puts the pieces on the table, letting you try to put them together, but then will continue handing you pieces until the picture becomes clearer.  Clearly the movie is designed to be over-the-top, both from Williem Dafoe's character to the action sequences themselves. Williem Dafoe makes this movie for me. The plot, which centers on religiously-inspired vigilante justice, has an air of being somewhat cliched, although I would be hard pressed to name another movie which handles it in this matter.  I still fail to see how others consider this movie vacuous and without meaning, when its message about the pitfalls of our current legal system and the need for something that transcends it is quite clear. I thought the ending, in which various people are interviewed about their opinion of the \\\"Saints\\\" and how for some vigilante justice was an incredibly sensitive issue, made this point very clear.\", \"A fourth year film student with a chip on his/her shoulder will probably tell you that this film is simple, uninspired, derivative, gratuitous..... ignore him/her just like you always do and see this genuinely funny movie. It has an inspired performance by Willem Dafoe and enough new ideas to keep you glued. The social commentary should probably be looked at as more of a plot device than intelligent thought, but I found myself watching this movie repeatedly and enjoying it more the second and third time around. This is definitely a naughty pleasure for the movie enthusiast.\", \"Preliminary remark: the comments refer to a pre-release version that was shown at the \\\"Fantasy Film Festival\\\" in Cologne, Germany, in August 1999.  \\\"Boondock Saints\\\" is a clever, funny, sufficiently violent movie with an overall high entertainment value. The story revolves around two Irish-American brothers and an excentric gay FBI agent (awesome: William Dafoe). The brothers - devout Catholics - who speak several languages fluently and work in a slaughterhouse find themselves equipped with money and weapons and subsequently start their very own crusade against the evil men of Boston - professional killers, mafia bosses and drug dealers. The agent is at their heels from the outset, but he has to realize that justice is on the side of the brothers...  This basic plot is the foundation for a highly energetic narrative: we get excellent and at times highly comic dialogues (with a high F***-word ratio), running gags, and lots of crazy situations and plot developments that are as absurd as they are funny. The action/shooting scenes are well-choreographed with a fine eye for the detail, but it's the main characters, their dialogues and developments around which the movie is develops rather than the action sequences.  On top of this, we get a fractured time/place structure that's already familiar from movies such as Kubrick's \\\"The Killing\\\" or Tarantino's \\\"Reservoir Dogs\\\", but \\\"Boondock Saints\\\" takes it to new extremes - and thus it's fun to watch.  Of course, the characters are a bit shallow every now and then and one would love to learn more about their background, but that's only a slight criticism. Overall, and measured by its own intention, \\\"Boondock Saints\\\" is great entertainment. More, it doesn't need to be.\", \"I know there's a lot of people who either worship this movie or hate it. Truth be told this movie is just a fun action movie with a good plot, great characters, and very good direction. Compare it to whatever you want, but you can do that with any movie out there. If you haven't had the chance to catch this flick, go out and rent it! it's one of those movies that shouldn't be missed. I guarantee that once you see it you'll be quoting it left and right. Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus have amazing chemistry together, and David Del Rocko just adds the comedic relief that makes the trio one thats hard to take your eyes off of.   See the Boondock Saints and get ready to have a good ole celtic time.  (B)\", \"Very intelligent action movie, about two Irish brothers who kill 'sinners' to punish them. The movie is a bit different from the typical action movie, as it doesn't have car-chases or explosions. The action consists of stylish shooting sprees. It also has a fairly original idea that is utilized in nearly every action scene in the movie, and that should be used more often in action films; first you see the aftermath, the crime-scene, the police investigating, counting bodies, etc. After/as the police come up with theories to the crime, we see the actual scene, of the brothers punishing criminals. It's a different kind of vigilante movie. It's particularly gory and bloody, but this just makes it all the more realistic. In real life, there is a significant amount of blood when someone is shot in the head. The movie has some Christian subtexts, I think I've heard about five major theories about the whole movie's meaning. This shows, in my opinion, that there was obviously a lot of thought put into the movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who can stand the gore, even if they aren't Christians. 10/10\", \"This film had the sad history of being blackballed in the United States due to the incident at Columbine...which is a real shame, because it is a treasure...written and directed by Troy Duffy, Boondocks is set in Boston...it is the story of fraternal twin Irish boys (Connor and Murphy McManus) who work in a meat packing plant...when their friend, Doc, is being stiff armed by the Russian Mafia, the boys and their friends step in to help...and away we go!

I was hoping to see a few sparks of what became his signature...interesting little bits of humorous, off-beat dialog. For that, I wasn't disappointed. As in SN, you can't help but like his character. Dignan despite the fact he is simply a petty thief. Through he little dialogs and mannerisms, he is almost able to convince you he doesn't mean to do others harm, but is really just seeking a place to be be recognized and to belong.  Like his brother, Luke Wilson also shows a little bit of what would come to be his stereotypical role. He plays Anthony, the earnest and honest follower who would rather settle down and find love then get involved in illegal activities. In this role he manages to convince us he only gets involved out of a sense of loyalty, rather than to actually gain anything for himself.  I was a bit let down by the Bob character, played by Robert Musgrave. He reminds me of a jelly fish, both in his character and in his acting: you see the vague outline of what he is trying to be, but in the end there is very little substance to hang on to. Bob apparently yearns for acceptance by his brother, but ends up looking like a man without a backbone.  Story  The loose plot revolves around the lives of three friends in their attempts to build lives for themselves. Anthony apparently is just looking for someone to love, Dignan is seeking a club to belong to and Bob desires a loving relationship with his brother. Together, they form a little \\\"gang\\\" with Dignan as the ring-leader.  Overall, I was entertained by the various vignettes that make up the movie, but disappointed with the movie as a whole. The overall plot line, if you can call it that, does not really lace the movie together in a tight package. I felt like the conclusion was an afterthought rather than a planned event.

The plot tried to look amazing and flawless, but it was just over-combined. Rachel Weisz is damn beautiful and also skilled in acting, but most of the film is killed by absolutely expressionless Burns. Hoffman's role seemed purposeless to me. I like Andy Garcia and he didn't disappoint. The creators just failed to give it some spirit, something that would keep your eyes open through boring dialogs. The best thing in the movie the song Clocks in ending credits.  Well, if I hadn't looked forward for this flick so much, maybe I would give it a higher rating. Slow, boring, surprise-less Ocean Two. No way.\", \"One can't help thinking director Foley is a director without much in the way of confidence himself . A sure sign of someone knowing they lack confidence in day to day life is for them to disguise this by putting up a loud front thereby hiding whatever inadequacies they feel they may have . Perhaps the director feels the world may have something against him because he once directed the long forgotten Madonna star vehicle WHO'S THAT GIRL ? Possibly I don't know , but he directs CONFIDENCE in an entirely fast paced way , rather like \\\" MTV Meets The Coen Brothers \\\" which may give audience members a potential headache  Despite the directing which comes across as garish and shallow we're left with a movie that is let down by the script and one can't help thinking the screenplay is what caused the director to look for Scorsese's CASINO for inspiration . No one can dispute the dialogue is foul mouthed , perhaps too much so but are the characters , situations and dialogue quirky or is everything unconvincing ? Considering I only gave this movie four out of ten it's not too difficult to understand what I thought of it .

First of all, it would be nice if some of these screenwriters had experience that went beyond just having watched other movies dealing with cons. It would be nice if directors could come up with some original scenes, instead of slow-mow shots of the crew walking down the street. It would be nice if Edward Burns could learn to act. HOWEVER, what would be really nice, is if people would proof-read these lame scripts and realize how truly lame they are. I mean, this is the worst dialog and story I have seen in a long time. I mean, the actors must have known this was crap as it was being filmed. The story is a rehashed tale. A group of grifters pulls off a con on someone big. So, they have to pull another con to make it right. Sound familiar? So they must have the eccentric bad guys. The witty crew members. The tacked on love angle. The blah blah blah. * out of ****.\", \"Everyone probably thought they had seen the last of the caper movies when Sinatra et al. made the original Oceans 11 forty years ago. Not so, as this film inter alia is abundant proof of its re-emergence. The Brit Gangster revival cycle initiated by \\\"Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels\\\" seems to have cross germinated with the \\\"Oceans Eleven\\\" remake and spawned a genetically modified caper for the 21st. century of which this film is but one of many.  Normally my John Bull heart would swell with pride as Pinewood influences Hollywood but not so in this case. Guy Ritchie's shtick does not travel and this film just does not quite work on a number of levels.  I have described this film as a caper but I think the director has tried to make something more than a simple caper movie. However there are problems with this approach. First of all it seems he cannot decide what tone it should take. Is it ironic or parodic or a comic book adventure, a pastiche or a spoof? No one can tell. The director probably feels that the film dances nimbly between all these categories artfully evading any pigeon hole. However as a humble viewer I just felt it was a mishmash that lacked the courage of its convictions to set out its stall in any particular category. It did not convince as an example of irony or a comic book adventure or an exercise in cool.  I think someone defined a caper movie as one in which the people making the film had more fun making it than the audience had watching it In that case the film falls straight in the middle of the caper bracket. the film is too slick and too knowing. These are common afflictions in contemporary films which you would probably overlook if the film was good enough in other respects. Although this film has redeeming features they do not compensate for these shortcomings.  It has some great character actors in the cast who give good performances Giametti, Guzman, Garcia in fact everyone except the two main actors portraying the central couple Edward Burns and Rachel Weisz. The character played by Burns is supposed to be the hub around which the whole film revolves but I am afraid in this case the axle is broken. Burns cannot carry the film and is constantly outshone by the actors that surround him. I get the impression that he is supposed to be the old-fashioned straight (in the old sense) lead whose looks offset all the ugly character actors. However he radiates zero menace or malevolence or evil or anything that might make him believable in the role. \\\"Things to do in Denver when you're dead\\\" survived without a good looking bland central character so why does this film need one. Maybe the guy is \\\"box office\\\" as I believe they say, but I have never heard of him so how exactly did he add to the film.  And so on to the vexed subject of Rachel Weisz's performance. It amazes me that Americans tolerate my fellow nationals doing lame non-specific non-regional faltering American accents. She came across as a Helena Bonham Carter for the 2000s. If this had been done by Merchant Ivory then she might have fitted right in but it wasn't and she didn't.  I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone but a couple of the set ups for con tricks were just poor. I will mention one episode which is not intrinsic to the plot where a rich customer in a jewellery shop gets reeled in. It is a popular misconception in films that rich people are stupid dupes who are easily parted from their money. This is lazy plotting. Rich people are usually not rich by accident unless they are lottery winners of course. They are rich because they know how to get money and then how to hold on to it. Is it really that easy to part them from their money? A lot of con artists doing time might suggest otherwise.  My final issue with the film is the first ten minutes which are as wooden as any episode of \\\"Murder she wrote\\\".

The script is full of holes (has he written a book yet, or not?), cliches (relationship trouble: she works days, he works nights), and provides so little insight into such basics as character motivation that it requires a voice-over narration just to move the story along.  In an attempt to keep the audience from dozing off, it includes a street fight scene that is about as realistic as a high school production of Julius Caesar.

Otherwise, save your money.  \", \"I respect Mike Hodges, and liked Get Carter immensely for it's bleak outlook, but The Croupier just seems like a particularly dull ITV drama.  The reserved, cold acting isn't just the preserve of the lead character, it's spread to the entire cast, meaning there is nothing to contrast Owen's character with.  None of the characters evoke any kind of feelings at all, except boredom. The ending of the film is also untidy at best.

The main character is portrayed as this wonderful intelligent writer who gets drawn into a web of deception, all the while there is running his monologue of the book he is writing. I can't say I would buy the book, a much better premise perhaps would have been if the voice-over (which annoyingly cuts in to narrate any bit of the film that you might not have understood, via his book) would've had 52 different personailties... to represent each card in the deck, but I digress. In the end there was a twist, whereby the main character has been setup by someone close to him, but as I disliked his character so much by this point (I found it impossible to like anyone in this film, the characters are all one dimensional zombies) that I really didn't care, and was glad the film was over.

It just about managed to keep my attention as the protagonist was seen slowly and predictably breaking all the life rules he had conveniently set himself at the beginning of the film.  But it's in the last 25 minutes or so that things really start to spiral. A vaguely plausible plotline (and that's being generous)becomes completely rediculous as suddenly new characters appear from nowhere and random and bizzarre events are never explained.  This wouldn't be quite so bad if the scripting wasn't so cheesy, the acting so wooden (despite a strong British cast) and the direction so uninspiring. This is not an example of good British film making nor indeed should it make Tarantino bat an eyelid, at least not in comparison to his earlier work.  My advice in this case, if it's hard to get hold of, don't waste the effort. If you're a Brit like me and it's in your local video shop, steer well clear.

The credits to this movie are exactly the same as Dark Star, so I'm going to presume it was an alternate title. Dark Talon was nowhere near as funny as everyone else here states. The acting was lame, the editing slipshod, and overall stupid. At the beginning there's an annoying 1970's trucking song called \\\"Benson, Arizona\\\" that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Basically the plot revolves around a small crew of an interstellar bomber that goes around bombing places that are unstable. The bombs are sentient and respond to people. The obligatory disaster disrupts communication between the bombs and the crew. One of the crewmen goes out and has an absurdly idiotic existential conversation with the bomb that made no sense whatsoever. The movie I saw was done in under an hour and a half, with commercials thrown in, so I suspect that Dark Talon is an overedited version of Dark Star.  The alien is an inflatable red beach ball spray painted with a pair of monster hands that it walks on. It was silly and unconvincing as an alien.

The cinematography is mediocre, but may be the best part of the movie.  The acting is bad. A sad state when the female voice-over for the computer is the best actor. The dialogue is bad. The script is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost nonexistent.  The humor is not just subtle and sublime; it's nowhere to be found. As an example, a whole 20 minutes, of the 80 minute film, is spent on a lame 2 punch combo joke with the alien mascot and the elevator.  This was supposed to be a parody of everything from bad 50's SciFi to 2001. What we end up with though, is just a slightly updated version of an old 50's SciFi C-movie.

In one of film's greatest years, 1999, Detroit Rock City contends with Runaway Bride and Wild Wild West for the bottom spot in a barrel of junkies. The plot is masterful. Four scrawny high school youngsters finally have their chance at seeing the hard rock theatrics of KISS for\\u0085the third year in a row. So when their tickets are toiled by an ultra-religious, chain-smoking mom, the pals scramble themselves in getting to Detroit, and I'm sure you can figure out the rest.  Well, not exactly; the movie does go to extreme measures in explaining how the four band members (no, not Gene, Paul, Ace and Peter) go about getting these tickets: losing your virginity in a confessional; saving a smoked-out bimbo and your mom's Volvo (from the Soprano's Steve Schirripa, nonetheless); preventing a robbery in the midst of botching one for a 12-year-old's debt; and of course, stripping down to your bare essentials for MC Ron Jeremy after shuttling a full blender with bourbon-leftovers. Sounds funny, doesn't it? Perhaps Detroit Rock City does have a point with all this tomfoolery in how extreme sometimes these fans can go. And we do understand this movie is a comedy; it is supposed to be filled with slapstick. But does Detroit Rock City aim to the proper audience? It is rated R, meaning the only way prepubescent adolescents-the audience as I see it, to which many will eventually hail this one a classic-will voyeur is through illegal terms.  Detroit Rock City also fails at giving itself the late-1970's touch. The camera's texture quality is way too clear and way too bright, missing the necessary flair from films like This is Spinal Tap and Sid & Nancy. This would've allowed audiences to feel `more at home' with the times. Simply costuming kids into pre-90's grunge-wear and settling others into `disco infernos' does not do the trick. Environment does mean something you know; I doubt Detroit looked this glamorous in '78. If there's anything positive coming from this movie it's the kick-ass soundtrack of hard late-70 to early-80's rock. Van Halen, AC/DC, you name it, it's all here. Of course we can't forget KISS, the band aptly subjected throughout.  What the film noticeably fails to manage are questions concerning why the Knights of Satin's Service (it's really just KISS) were so frowned upon by moms around the nation. Sure, the loud rock and devilish makeup might be a part of that; encouragements for youth to explore themselves and have a good time might be fair reasons as well. But, what is KISS saying in the music we hear throughout the film towards this highly rebellious group? What separates these anthems of `rock[ing] and roll[ing] all night and partying everyday' from the rest of the music? Most likely, these questions will remain in a music communication class and not in the films that should answer them, simply because it is KISS and they rock and we must do everything in our God-forgiven power to see them.  1.5/5 stars\", \"Sometimes you get exactly what you expect. A film produced and by and as a vehicle for a rock band in the middle of a comeback is not to be expected to rank high in artistic merit- and in this case it certainly doesn't. In fact, as expected, the soundtrack is a much better investment than the movie itself, which like the 70's rock and roll lifestyle it attempts to portray, is characterized by excess, drugs, and over-the-top antics, but unfortunately is not nearly as much fun. Utilizing a script by Carl Dupre horrible enough to make a fellow screenwriter cringe, and wasting the talents of Edward Furlong, the sole highlight of this rock and roll period piece gone wrong is the music, most notably the elaborate recreating of a 1978 KISS concert.\"], \"review_score\": [2, 4], \"review_category\": [\"neg_test\", \"neg_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 3.0}, \"Donnie Darko\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0246578\", \"total_review_count\": 1, \"total_rating_count\": 1, \"review_content\": [\"Although I do not recommend this film, neither do I recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie. Though I have not given away the ending, or most of the plot twists, this movie would be best viewed without any prior information. It's hard to pinpoint the chief problem with the film Donnie Darko, as there are many to deal with. Richard Kelly, in his first feature film, seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage, late-night stoner diatribes, self-righteous justifications and inoffensive, banal philosophy to inspire twenty teen-angst dramas; then mashed them into a single two hour package with a sci-fi twist. The result is deeply distressing-- for all the wrong reasons. The film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning, to make them sympathize with one-dimensional characters, and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of unreconciled loose ends, by hiding it under a veneer of CGI effects and neo-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man, committed to therapy, misunderstood by his friends, and rendered hostile and disaffected by his suburban life. We are meant to feel that he is more intelligent than his schoolmates, although sometimes that is a difficult assumption to make. For example, when one of his friends comes up with an absurd theory about the Smurfs, and Donnie counters with a theory of his own, his friend complains about Donnie acting \\\"all smart.\\\" Donnie's speech, however, is no smarter than that of his friend-- just angrier. The only clear evidence of his intelligence is his principal's description of his standardized test scores as `intimidating;' but given the director's slant against simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), this is a poor substitute for character development. Donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems, which are not addressed directly in this film. In fact, the entire issue of the drugs is understated, and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that all of this may be a product of his imagination, is pushed into the background, making the film 100 percent science fiction. This would not be a bad thing in itself, except that the \\\"science\\\" behind the \\\"fiction\\\" is very shaky. The explanations of time travel are weak, at best sounding like detached, uninformed rambling. We get the idea that the film's writer once read a book about time travel or a few chapters, and can't quite remember how it worked, but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film. The scientific portion, as a result, depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved (at one point, a teacher discussing time travel states that if he continues to speak on the subject, he'd be fired. Apparently no further explanation is needed). Donnie's dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions. The justification for these actions is a tricky business. He damages his school, but it's okay, because his school doesn't treat him like a person. His punishment of a creepy self-esteem advocate (somewhat similar to Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia) results in the man's public humiliation. But should the audience believe that Donnie is some sort of avenging angel, striking out against ignorance and debauchery? He himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact. Aside from these flaws, the film is riddled with flat, uninteresting generalizations of humanity. The story is set in 1988, just before the Bush/Dukakis election, and the director touches on this point during the film. The focus, however, extends exactly this far: Donnie's gruff, blue collar father is voting for Bush, while his free-spirited, rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. There is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement here; simply a statement of the obvious. The former are not necessary to make a good film, but the latter should be left out. Likewise, Donnie's heartfelt speech about not being able to lump all human emotions into the bland categories of \\\"fear and \\\"love;\\\" this doesn't ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding. Everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions, and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless. Mr. Kelly gives homage to several symbols of 80's pop culture in his film: E.T., Stephen King, the Smurfs, Back to the Future. At it's heart, this film feels like the director's homage to himself, a collection of his own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, affirmations and disenchantments, roughly stitched together by untrained hands. Entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions, seemingly because the director likes the songs. Characters who have little to no bearing on the plot (including the archetypal bully, fat girl, and right-wing idiot teacher) are given unnecessary focus, because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow. The awkward mess that is Donnie Darko leaves us wondering if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas left in his head to make another film, or if he has wasted all his creativity in one pointless, cluttered, meandering effort.

I was touched by the film because of its storyline of drama, brilliant script, acting and music. The sorrowful and suffering life of John Merrick and the grand end of his life brings out the sadness in us all. At the end of the film, the music, Barber's 'Adagio for Strings', is a masterpiece, it fitted perfectly into the upsetting grand finale. I mostly enjoy 'true' films, when the plot actually happened.   Overall, I suggest the film to be one of the best in movie history. It brought out the best in John Hurt, and the joy within us. With its outstanding cast, subtle and touching script, The Elephant Man proves to be David Lynch's finest.\", \"With a crowd bearing down on him, the tortured cry of The Elephant Man (John Hurt) rings out: \\\"I am not an elephant! I am not an animal! I am a human being!\\\"  Set in Victorian England, it looks into the Freak Show trade that was popular then, through one particular gentleman, grossly and uniquely deformed, by the name of John Merrick (The Elephant Man), and is based on the memoirs of the doctor played by Anthony Hopkins, Dr Frederick Treves. It shows the humanity of poor Mr Merrick and condemns the society that exploited him for its own monetary gain and sick pleasure.  The story itself is a difficult one, and i'm surprised that any producer, even someone as offbeat as Mel Brooks, would have agreed to pour money into this idea. It has none of the classic elements of the commercial formula for making a movie that will make money: it has no love story, it has no sex, and, without spoiling too much, it is quite a tragic, unhappy story.  The pervasive tragedy of the story is that John Merrick is an intelligent man, trapped inside this hideously misshapen body. Hanging over the head of the story is also the fact that nothing can be done for Mr Merrick. And the metaphor running throughout is that Merrick is no elephant man at all, he's just as human as the rest of us, but this exhibitionist, heartless society whipped him and made him dance around for them like an elephant in a circus tent.  \\\"Luck, my friend,\\\" A circus dwarf says to the elephant man at one point in the story, \\\"and who needs it but we.\\\"  It is a story of immense sensitivity and humanity, and one the likes of which you won't see anywhere else. Its definitely not for the weak-hearted or depressed. Its often devastatingly difficult to watch (mainly in one or two scenes), most of this story is wildly compelling and human drama due to the immense talents of Lynch and Hopkins in particular. There are certainly moments of reprieve - all is not black.  Its certainly a beautiful movie - every frame is perfection. Gorgeous black and white cinematography give this subject the class it deserves. A wonderful score by John Morris helps give it a haunting beauty. It is directed with superb classical storytelling, illustrated by Lynchian brushstrokes: expressionistic dream sequences and trademark Lynchian soundtrack. David Lynch should be very proud of this early effort. It is a marvellous film. The sensitivity of the construction, and its classic perfection, are the work of a master.  But it is hard to say what this movie would be without Anthony Hopkins. It is a topic that easily could have fallen into the trap of the society it depicts, of exploiting freaks for the petty thrill of exhibitionism. But whatever credit for this that does not go to Lynch, must go to Hopkins. His sincere delivery, in one of the most genuine performances i've ever seen, are a major factor in our believing this story really happened (which it did), and taking it seriously (which we do).  5 stars.\", \"I'm not writing any more plaudits for this movie, for most everything has been said about it before. Even a quarter century later, I weep everytime I watch Mr. Hurt and Mr. Hopkins in their roles. The great humanity of David Lynch and the producers has left us with an equally frightening and endearing vision of Mr. Merick.  Sadly, there will always be elephant men, as long as ignorance and the impulse for destruction rule men and their domain.\", \"I truly enjoyed this film. I've always been told that I'm fairly mature for my age - I'm not even old enough to drive yet & I'm already learning & respecting morals. In this case, 'Don't judge a book by its cover'.  Some parts made me very angry - when Merrick was mistreated & exploited like an animal that he certainly wasn't. He didn't deserve the treatment that people like Bytes & the person working at the hospital gave him.  I forgot that I was watching a movie for a while & became incredibly angered far more times than once.  I loved the movie a lot, but it made me incredibly inraged that people that treated John like that can actually exist.\", \"This film is one of the greatest of all time. Hurt and Hopkins are excellent and the great Wendy Hillier and John Geilgud put in superb turns. The script is at once energetic,emotional and perfectly paced. Lynch's direction is also awesome. why did this film not win best picture? it is a trillion times better than ordinary people. Well done to Mel Brooks for producing such a beautiful film and having faith in the then relatively unheard of David Lynch. To me this is a crowning point in the careers of of Brooks,Lynch,Hurt, Hopkins,Hillier,Geilgud,Bancroft. A pure unadulterated masterpiece Brilliant\", \"This is a beautiful film. Touching, elegant and moving and with a strong moral message, a message which does not beat you over the head but instead gently pushes at your sensibilities. This should be a film that everyone should be forced to watch, especially the most shallow and judgmental demographic, young women. They have made me feel like an Elphant Man myself on many occasions, which is why I had a special empathy with the main character.  One of the best aspects of the film is the setting. It is absolutely perfect in recreating late 1800's London, a fantastic attention to detail. Shooting in B&W greatly enhances this.  The acting is also superb, especially from Hopkins and Hurt. I think this is Hopkin's best performance and most memorable, much better than Hannibal Lector, which he has unfortunately become typecast as. It's much better to see him as this kind, sympathetic character than Lector. Also fantastic characters were mother's Head and Carr Gomm. I absolutely love the dialog in this film, especially everything Carr Gomm says. He has a gentlemanly charm that we won't ever see again in the world, even in Merry Old England, and that is so unfortunate. Of course the evil characters, Bytes and the guard, were also memorable.  There is really only one thing I didn't think was necessary in this movie. The strange montages of elephants and smoke and stars just didn't seem to belong in what was otherwise such a perfectly set, directed and acted film. It's a very minor criticism though.  The ending is sad yet sobering. The story, though embellished somewhat from the truth, still carries an important message of simple humanity and dignity.\", \"Nobody but Lynch could have directed this movie and made it the masterpiece that it is. Where other people would have gone for fake sentimentality and/or gruesome imagery; Lynch just presents the story how it is. The film is never gratuitous, and that is much to it's credit. It is, however, utterly repulsive. The black and white cinematography enforces this. There is nothing pleasant about The Elephant Man; it is as ugly as it's title character, and that is the way that this story needs to be. On the surface, it is ugly and repulsive; but just like it's title character; the movie has a hidden depth that is ultimately touching and heartbreaking. The movie sets itself up for this early on; the scene in which the Elephant Man is introduced is most of the most gut wrenching ever committed to film. As the doctor (Anthony Hopkins) sees the freak rise up and realises the extent of his deformity...a tear slowly form and rolls down his cheek. From this, you can see the pity that he feels for this man who has drawn the lot of a lowly circus freak; just from that one shot of a tear, David Lynch shows us the sorrow and the pity, and that's all he needs. Where some directors would have piled the sentimentality on, David Lynch is economic; that's all it needs, so that's all it gets. And that is the mark of a great director. Something that David Lynch most certainly is.  The film is also ironic. Aside from it's visuals that link to the title character, it also observes how society is not unlike a circus. The good doctor has taken the Elephant Man away from the glares and the scowls of the circus audience, the exploitation that he's had to face, and put him a kinder and more loving environment; only now the scowls and stares come not from the circus audience, but from society's upper crust, who want to exploit the Elephant Man themselves for their own selfish reasons - to impress their friends. The Elephant Man is not merely a horror story of the life of a very unfortunate man; it's a story of love, a story of acceptance. Despite being taken from one circus to another, the Elephant Man is happier and more fulfilled than he ever was; he doesn't care about the looks and the exploitation, he merely wants to be loved. By 'normal' people, this is taken for granted; but The Elephant Man shows us that love and acceptance isn't something that can be taken for granted. As one doctor notes in the film, \\\"we can't imagine the life he's had\\\". We can't.  David Lynch also succeeds in making voyeurs out of his audience. Just like the various audiences in the film; we too want to see the Elephant Man, and yet are utterly repulsed and disgusted by him. With this, David Lynch makes a mockery out of today's society, without ever making a mockery out of the character upon which this film is based. The Elephant Man himself is a perfectly balanced example of how pathos can be achieved. Not only is this man seen as a monster, but his character is pathetic also. With The Elephant Man, Lynch is saying to the world that it is society that is the monster, not the freaks that live within it.  To put it simply: David Lynch has taken a story that could have easily been told simply and expanded it to take in themes that are outside of the central premise. This small story of one unfortunate man has been moulded into a striking comment on society. And all in all; it's a masterpiece.\", \"Hi all,  I saw this movie for the 1st time on 5th December 1999. I was about to go to sleep as it was about 00-40 in the morning and I flicked over to the movie and even though I was falling asleep as I flicked over to it, within five minutes I was wide awake and totally captivated.  Everyone knows the tale of John Merrick, it is so sad and painful to watch and see a man with above average intelligence trapped by his physical deformity and to be physically and mentally abused and tortured for a few meagre pence.  I thought Sir John Gieulgud(?) and Sir Anthony Hopkins were both excellent in their respective roles. John Hurt did Merrick proud.  I had a bit more than water in my eye on 4 occasions during this movie and not ashamed to admit it either. This is the 1st movie to make me cry.  On the Kleenex scale - Titanic is 1 and this is 10!  A movie not to be missed but be prepared to be disgusted and upset by the story told.  ThePM\", \"this is a brilliantly done film. it is quite raw and blunt about its subject matter, however, so it should not be viewed for \\\"entertainment\\\" purposes, thought he story is inherently intriguing. we must just sit and watch in curiousity and amazement, but in concurrence with extreme sorrow, as we are shown the brutality that john merrick must face as his reality. a smile from another human being, or even a pleasant greeting (which is something that we all take for granted), is treated by this man as the highest form of complimentary behavior possible.  one of the best films that i have ever seen. it wouldnt be called a top 25 of all-time film by the public (though i may place it there), however, based solely on the fact that it, as i mentioned earlier, is lacking in terms of typical \\\"entertainment\\\" value. even though you will certainly be immersed the entire way through. ah, who knows! im not expressing myself very well. make it a priority to see this film. enjoy  absolutely amazing and memorable - 10/10\", \"Between the surreal dystopia of Eraserhead and the artistic immobility of Dune, and before critics labeled him as the auteur of Weird America with permanent marker, David Lynch directed this strange but true story set in London, England during the late 1800's. Being one of only two films of his to be based on fact it is far less of a personal work than those generated by the director himself. Despite his sensibilities being contained in a more formal framework his unique aural and visual style (like the sound of blowing wind or the peculiar emphasis of the industrial machinery of the period)clearly comes across, although it's a far cry from the narrative conundrums that comprise Eraserhead, Lost Highway, or Mulholland Dr.  The year before this film was released Bernard Pomerance's play opened on Broadway. This film is not based upon the former work and the latter takes a dramatically divergent path with its namesake subject. One of the most substantial is Merrick's role in his adoptive society once his carnival career is truncated. Pomerance's tale is a tragic one showing us how Merrick becomes caught in the machinery of the repressive and hypocritical society that cultivates him, tempting him with the illusion of normality with the artificial world they erect around him, but ultimately imprisoning him within it. The film depicts Victorian society as a benevolent sanctuary for a man, who while given the props to model himself after the normality he aspires to, is never deceived into thinking he can achieve it beyond his imagination. Merrick's own realization of this is clear in a scene (hauntingly scored by composer John Morris)where he asks his caretaker Treeves if he can cure him. Treeves' reply is no. Merrick's response is of a man who knew the answer all along but still allows himself the indulgence to dream.  Treeves' struggles are similarly reduced. The closest he comes in the film to questioning his motives concerning Merrick is a brief scene where he asks his wife (and audience) if his seemingly charitable act of taking Merrick from his sideshow squalor was possibly something other than altruistic. Pomerance has Treeves questioning the artificial social fabric that's been woven around Merrick and his undeniable complicity in it. The screenwriters seem less concerned with tackling these Victorian dilemmas than focusing on the beauty in the beast theme. Considering Lynch's fascination with organic phenomena this focus seems much more up his alley. In his words Lynch has stated that the eponymous title character is \\\"this beautiful soul trapped in this horrible body and that's what the whole film is about.\\\" Yes siree Bob.  Much less effective in the film is the role of the actress Madge Kendall who's really nothing more than a walk on by Anne Bancroft. There is some(even subtly sexual)awkwardness between Merrick and Kendall at the beginning of their meeting together but it ultimately winds up with a scene that feels patronizing towards Merrick and mawkish. It doesn't fit with the earlier tension and Kendall never becomes anything more than a well acted cameo. Much more effective is Merrick's ability to retain the power to disturb the bourgeois society that flocks to see him once he becomes that season's fashionable curiosity. His transformation into a gentrified version of his erstwhile sawdust and calliope music carnival persona still has the same effect on others. In one scene he is serving tea to a noticeably unnerved aristocratic couple who are guests of his. Their cups rattle against their saucers in barely restrained horror as he discusses his mother's beauty in the context of his own deformity. His cherished portrait of his mother becomes an eerily recurring visual motif. She remains a mysterious presence frozen in time. The conflation of Merrick and his mother recalls a line heard early in the film that \\\"life is full of surprises.\\\"  Merrick's background remains equally enigmatic. The only glimpse we see of his past are some creepily abstract images during one of his nightmares. Even his beginnings are fictionalized as part of the sideshow spiel recited by his owner Bytes. Treeves' first view of the elephant man is in a private showing by Bytes. He is led down a dark corridor to a room where the terrible freak is kept concealed behind a curtain. Only the flames of a gas lamp illuminate the darkness. Bytes spins a tale of a terrifying encounter between woman and elephant while Treeves stares, mouth agape. The scene has a strange Lynchian spookiness about it.  The costume and production design authentically breathe life into the Victorian era while Freddie Francis' expressionistic monochrome adds both verisimilitude and a sense of an alternative world. These elements together with Lynch's use of both nightmarish and chimerical images, an other worldly atmosphere, pathos and sentiment, make the film a sort of Charles Dickens tale wrapped inside The Twilight Zone with the ethereal touch of a haunting dream. The past a la Lynch.\", \"Man, this is a powerful and great movie. We are all moved different degrees by different things, but to witness sincerely nice people being treated cruelly always bothers me big- time....so this film is tough to watch in spots. Some scenes are just painful and depressing to view.   Whatever your sensitivity, the movie is very involving and hauntingly shown with eerie black-and-white photography. Eerie, and downright beautiful camera-work in here, so kudos to cinematographer Freddie Francis, one of the best in the business.  A young Anthony Hopkins is very likable and John Hurt is, well, someone you won't soon forget as John Merrick, \\\"The Elephant Man.\\\"  This is an uplifting movie at times, too, not just a tear-jerker or horrific in showing man's cruelty to man. Be prepared for an emotional experience and an amazing story.\", \"There have been many films made dealing with an individual who's outer appearance is completely at odds with their inner character. Some of these films are quite good but this is by far and away the very best. This is probably one of the most perfect films ever made. It succeeds on every level. Visually it transports one into a dark, grey, industrial nightmare of a world. It's within this world that we come to discover true beauty. It lies within one hideously deformed, abused and unfortunate soul who is being kicked around in this hellish existence. The screenplay, acting, direction all come together to create this extraordinary viewing experience. You really feel like you get inside this man and his tortured existence. The ending is one of the most effective and completely engrossing I've ever seen. Rarely does a film find a way to leave us with such a sense of closure and lingering fascination. The thing that really makes this film truly great is it changes the way people see themselves, other people and the world. I can still remember the palpable air of silence and awe over the audience when leaving the theater both times I saw it on the big screen. There's a transforming quality about it. You only need to read the many other user comments to see how people were moved and changed by this film. If you haven't seen it, it's a must!\", \"David Lynch is a remarkable director and The Elephant Man is a remarkable film. Inspired by a true story in the streets of London during the Victorian Age, the film is based entirely around the life of John Merrick (John Hurt), an individual dubbed by his `owner' Bytes (Freddie Jones) and others as 'The Elephant Man' because of his hideous deformities. With this film, Lynch grasps his audience and stretches them to a new parallel of an emotionally capturing film. And what makes this so daunting and so intriguing is the fact that 'The Elephant Man' is a true story, no part of it is fictional. Anthony Hopkins plays Dr. Frederick Treves, the man who somewhat saves John from those who persecute him for being a freak, being a `monster.' A story of human triumph could never be so remarkable as that of The Elephant Man. Lynch takes The Elephant Man to a new level of technical aspiration with a dark, dank setting shot completely in black and white. This film is amazing and would undoubtedly be just okay any other way. The black and white adds to the story in a way that touches the audience much deeper and much more personal. Not to mention stunning performances and dialogue by all cast, `David Lynch's portrait of John 'The Elephant Man' Merrick stands as one of the best biographies on film.' Literary critic Leslie Fiedler maintains that freaks stir `both supernatural terror and natural sympathies' because they `challenge conventional boundaries between male and female, sexed and sexless, animal and human, large and small, self and other.' In this very interesting and moving film, we are challenged to clarify our values in regard to `very special people.' However, in one powerful scene of tension and curiosity, John Merrick screams out, `I am not an animal! I am a human being! I.am.a man!' This particular sequence, I believe, is incredible and it ties in with the whole focus of the film itself, human dignity and emotion. David Lynch is known for some pretty twisted films, and yet, The Elephant Man is not that twisted at all. Even though his audience views John Merrick as not the average person because of his medical condition, the story is cherished because of how it is put onto the big screen. Compared to his other films such as Blue Velvet and Eraserhead, The Elephant Man is more surreal in terms of what Lynch was going for. Lynch does a magnificent job in portraying his version of The Elephant Man, and many people along with critics alike agree. I can easily rate The Elephant Man with four stars because David Lynch deserves no less. The Elephant Man is a classic, a striking and devastating film depicting the account of John Merrick's search for a dignified and normal life. I would definitely recommend this film to those in search of a wonderful story about one man's conquest to a regular life. Dr. Treves' account with John not only presents him with respect and normalcy, but also takes him as far as an uplifting scene where upon John states `my life is full because I know I am loved.' With such an inspirational and true story, David Lynch puts on a film that should be loved by many, if not all.\", \"I just watched this movie last night and i must say... it touched me in a way no other movie has... some of the scenes even brought me to tears, which has never happened to me before.... John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins are simple incredible, and this movie is just filled with unforgettable scenes....  but like some people have mentioned here before, it is an incredibly hard movie to watch, especially after you realize what a sweet, kind, smart and innocent man John Merrick was, it is often painful to watch the way he's treated by some people, and like Hopkins says after he sees him for the first time \\\"I pray to god that he's an idiot\\\", sadly, he is everything but that...  10/10, no question\", \"  This movie changed my life forever. To see someone so beautiful, dignified, and unique, hidden behind a body and face that society considers ugly, made me realize how the body is a decaying pile of dust, but the soul is a breath-taking and uniquely formed indestructible diamond.  I believe that everyone should get a chance to see this film, for those of an open mind, and a caring soul, there is nothing else like it.  It also shows the detestable ways some people treat others. I felt at first pity for John Merrick, but then my feelings changed to admiration, as the film went on. John, in the film starts as a severely deformed mute figure being badly mistreated, as the story progresses, he becomes the hero. A bold and courageous man, standing against the evils of modern society.  Joseph (John) Merrick, was a man so one-of-a-kind, that someone else like him physically or emotionally will never appear again. His life should be taken as an example to everyone.  As in the film, John's mother says \\\"Nothing will Die\\\", Joseph Merrick will live on in the hearts and souls of everyone who has witnessed the story of his life.  My love goes to Joseph Merrick, where ever he may be.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Erik the Viking\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0097289\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0338013\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0106834\", \"total_review_count\": 27, \"total_rating_count\": 27, \"review_content\": [\"This film got terrible reviews but because it was offbeat and because critics don't usually \\\"get\\\" offbeat films, I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately they were largely right in this instance.  The film just has an awkward feel too it that is most off putting. The sort of feel that is impossible to describe, but it's not a good one. To further confound things, the script is a dull aimless thing that is only vaguely interesting.  The immensely talented Thurman just drifts through this mess creating barely an impact. Hurt and Bracco try in vain to add something to the film with enthusiastic performance but there is nothing in the script. It may have been less embarrassing for them if they had merely chosen to drift and get it over with like Thurman.  One thing the \\\"esteemed\\\" film critics did fail to mention however is that the film is actually quite funny. Whether it be moments of accurate satire or some outrageously weird moments like when the cowgirls in question chase Hurt off their ranch with the smell of their unwashed...ahem...front bottoms.  Because of the chortles acheived throughout, while I wouldn't recommend this film, there is entertainment to be had and watching Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is worthwhile for something different.\", \"This was an excellent film. I don't understand why so many people don't like it. There was so much in it to connect with, so many beautiful images, and so much compassion in the things that weren't said. I was thoroughly entertained, and was left with a feeling of joyous exuberance, just as I am when I finish most any Tom Robbins story. Now I haven't read this particular book of Robbin's, so I don't now how this matched up, but I can't imagine this movie could have been a very bad interpretation. The movie left a lot for you to define yourself, which is the best part of any Tom Robbins novel, dreaming up the details.   To all of you who said this was the worst movie ever, I pity what little must be left of the dimming light in your hearts. Far from the worst ever this movie was glorious. Long live the whooping crane.\", \"I admit, the first time I watched Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, I didn't think it was very memorable in any regard. But now after viewing it the 7th time, I admit that it has very much grown on me. The characters of Sissy, Ms. Jellybean, and the Countess have become very endearing. And the romance between Sissy and Jellybean seems very sweet. Though the plot is very weak, I think the satirical humor more than makes up for it. Then there's the kick-ass soundtrack which features the tremendously talented K.D. Lang (who reminds me a little of Patsy Cline) at her best. I can't think of any movie that has \\\"grown on me\\\" after an inauspicious first impression, as much as Cowgirls has.\", \"Worst movie of all time? Wow, whoa now. You cannot be serious.  Maybe it's all about what you expect a movie to do to you. I live in Oregon, so I got to enjoy the beautifully-filmed shots of familiar yet still amazingly beautiful Smith Rocks and other areas in Central Oregon (as well as the sweet cameo of our own Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs looking down on baby Sissy's cradle at the beginning of the movie). Those alone were enough to spur me to give the movie a better than \\\"average\\\" score.  Or .... Maybe it's all about what expectations you have. Having read the book AGES ago, and thinking to myself \\\"goodness, no one could ever make a movie out of this interesting, quirky, weird book ... especially 20 years later, when mores (MORAYS -- can't put in the accent mark online) have changed\\\" -- I was actually quite pleasantly surprised when I first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and even liked it more today watching it again.

The actors and the direction of this film are both good.   The only trouble with the film, as I can see it, is that Robbins can relate ideas and sentiments with his words that were still beyond Hollywood's capabilities at the time this film was shot.

It wasn't that the characters weren't well developed or the plot and content didn't come alive. It's just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this. We're taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and/or the best and it adds to the overall roller-coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author's precision.

This movie is not entertainment, at least not that easy entertainment you get on movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It has style, it is different, it is shocking... That's why most of you have hated it so much: because it does not try to be pleasing to you. It's just a story, a very weird one I admit, but after all, only a weird story. It is not a great story, not even a great cinema work, but I believe it is worth a 7-stars rating only for the courage of both author and director to shot a story that is not made to please the audience, thus selling billions of copies and making the big studios even richer.

I expected something better from Uma Thurman, which was the reason I suffered my way through this experience in the first place. An awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality. It\\u00b4s just a shame that we are incapable of giving 0 out of 10 in these reviews. This movie deserves it.\", \"There are movies like \\\"Plan 9\\\" that are so bad they have a charm about them, there are some like \\\"Waterworld\\\" that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident, and there are some like \\\"Desperate living\\\" that you hate to admit you love. Cowgirls have none of these redemptions. The cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable, and from what I've been told, the book is enjoyable.  How then could this movie be so intolerably bad? To begin with, it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings. Then tell them to do their best Kevin Costner imitations. Open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide expanses of America from being interesting in any way. Finally give the editing job to your brother-in-law, because the meat packing plant just laid him off. He does have twenty years of cutting experience.  This movie now defines the basement for me. It is so bad, it isn't even good for being bad.\", \"This is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime. Cool title, excellent director (I saw \\\"To Die For\\\" and \\\"Drugstore Cowboy\\\" before this), and hey - Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you go wrong? Well, that is a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after I watched this turkey.  Disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat, this is a dead-zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs. Its critical lambasting was well deserved. You have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redeeming quality. Zero out of ****.\", \"Certainly one of the dozen or so worst movies ever released in any form, featuring a bizarrely abominable performance by Rain Joan of Arc Phoenix (River's sister, inevitably), as Bonanza Jellybean plus inconceivably awful voiceover narration by Tom Robbins, the author of the novel, which had/retains its peculiar sweet/loopy charms.\", \"I watched this film because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I would give their sister a try, Rain Phoenix. I regret checking it out. She was embarrasing and the film just has this weird plot if thats what you want to call it. Sissy was just weird and Jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains, whats going on? I have never been so unsatisfied in my life. It was just total rubbish. I can't believe that the actors agreed to do such a waste of film, money, time and space. Have Sissy being 'beautiful' didnt get to me. I thought she was everything but that. Those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? WHATS THE POINT??? 0 out of 10, shame the poll doesnt have a 0, doesnt even deserve a 1. Hopefully, Rain is better in other films, I forgive her for this one performance, I mean I wouldnt do much better with that film.\", \"I missed this movie in the cinema but had some idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look, so when I saw it on the shelves in DVD I thought \\\"time to watch it\\\". Big mistake!  A long list of stars cannot save this turkey, surely one of the worst movies ever. An incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented. Perhaps it would have made more sense if I'd read Robbins' novel but unless the film is completely different to the novel, and with Robbins assisting in the screenplay I doubt it, the novel would have to be an excruciating read as well.  I hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more lately DVD blanks, take for example Pat Morita. Even Thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times.  Save yourself around 98 minutes of your life for something more worthwhile, like trimming your toenails or sorting out your sock drawer. Even when you see it in the \\\"under $5\\\" throw-away bin at your local store, resist the urge!\", \"I couldn't believe how lame & pointless this was. Basically there is nothing to laugh at in the movie, hardly any scenes to get you interested in the rest of the movie. This movie pulled in some huge stars but they were all wasted in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves must've taken some acting lessons a fews years after this movie before he stared in The Matrix. Uma Thurman looked very simple & humble. Luckily i got this movie for a very low price because its certainly not a movie to remember for any good reasons. I won't write anything about the story of the movie, but as you should know that she is meant to be the most famous hitchhiker across America because of her huge thumb. I would give this movie a 2 / 10. Before I watched this movie I was wondering why this movie has only got a 4.0/10, & now I know why. A very disappointing movie. Don't buy it even if you see it for under $5.\", \"No one should ever try to adapt a Tom Robbins book for screen. While the movie is fine and the performances are good, the dialogue, which works well reading it, is crap when spoken. Or, to put it another way, no one would be likely to suggest that hearing someone else's name was like seeing it written in radium on a pearl.  Overall, the movie feels like a badly-adapted Cliffs Notes to the book - most of the parts have been hacked down to a fifth of their size in the book, in terms of backstory and current story, and the ending is wildly (and unpleasantly) different from that of the book. Most of the plots from the book have gotten lost, including the one that makes everything make sense at the end, and there's more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say \\\"Huh?\\\" Not a worthy effort, unfortunately - the script should have been read, compared to the book, burned, and all the actors sent off to do something far better. I admire Gus Van Sant tremendously, but not even someone of his calibre could have made a decent movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries.\", \"Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and freakishly large thumbs) who hitchhikes cross-country, eventually finding her true place amongst a group of peyote-enlightened cowgirls on a ranch devoted to preserving the Whooping Crane; Rain(bow) Phoenix is their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, thumbs or not. Gus Van Sant directed and adapted Tom Robbins' book, but his satire has no primary target and just skitters all over the map, like Sissy (maybe that was his goal, but it's not involving for an audience). Notorious box-office flop wasn't so much panned as it was ignored, and one can see why: it's a series of sketches in search of a plot, and the performances, directorial touches and cinematography are all variable. Thurman is a stitch posing alongside the highway trying to get a ride, but this pretty much put the kibosh on Phoenix's career. Writer Buck Henry (who didn't write this, but perhaps should have) gives the most assured performance as the doctor who works on one of those thumbs.  Two thumbs down.\", \"I absolutely love all of Tom Robbins books, so I was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of his books. I knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of Robbins' magic, but after seeing the movie, it made me never want to read the book again. The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues doesn't include an eighth of the content in the book, and it seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie, I think that better actors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters. The only actors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins' descriptions in the book were Julian's friends, in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie. Those who haven't read the book might enjoy the movie, but as a huge Tom Robbins fan, this movie was nothing but a disappointment.\", \"I love movies. I love independent efforts and major studio productions. I love films with stars and I love those featuring unknowns. I love dramas, comedies, action-adventures, science fiction, mysteries, westerns, any genre except horror. I love foreign films as well as those in English. I love good movies and I even love bad ones, because almost no film ever fails to entertain or amuse on some level. Except for \\\"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues.\\\"  When I attended a late-night showing of \\\"Cowgirls,\\\" I joined an audience of around 10. Less than halfway into it, I alone remained. Soon not even I could tolerate the disturbing mess unfolding before my eyes, and I left as well. To this day \\\"Cowgirls\\\" remains the only movie I have ever walked out of.  I don't quite know how to describe this incoherent, vacuous, trashy, meaningless film, or how to adequately convey its lack of redeeming value. Suffice to say that it ranks as one of the worst major films of all time, preposterous and inexcusable on every level. It tries to be clever, but its conception of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic. It tries to be funny, but its humor is coarse and cringe-worthy. This is one of the few films which manages to profane its own ethos, by depicting protagonists in so off-putting a manner that you revolt against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, watch \\\"Waterworld,\\\" \\\"Ishtar,\\\" anything but this. Except for the new \\\"Alexander.\\\" If you're choosing between that and this, read a book instead.\", \"We actually watched this twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time. Maybe we'd missed something... nope, what's missing was missed from the beginning of preproduction. I actually went back to Robbin's novel to see if I could find the problem, and I discovered that what I thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much disconnected and fuzzy-headed junk.  So, the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it at all, and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there. Absolutely nothing works - not a blessed thing. Some beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled by random camera placement in interior shots. All of the actors look at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson looks positively mortified - except for Rain Phoenix, who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is. The dialog is one, long, unwavering cringe. Scenes don't make sense from second to second, and the connections between them are nonexistent. And yet, the movie stumbles blindly on, convinced that it is saying something profound.  This is too bad to even be funny; it is simply excruciating. Gus Van Zant has done other good-to-great movies which I encourage you to see, and I'm happy he survived (and appears to have learned from) this mess.\", \"I read Tom Robbins' EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES as a teenager. I loved every word. It was sexy, funny, and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I could not believe what a dull, sour, joyless piece of junk it was. How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it under \\\"GAY PRIDE -- WOMEN -- LESBIANS.\\\" (That's the Library of Congress subject heading.) Now anyone over 12 who reads the book will know it has NOTHING TO DO with real lesbians, any more than STAR WARS is about real space travel. The book was obviously -- and I do mean OBVIOUSLY --written by a heterosexual male who loves the IDEA of lesbians (in the nude, all the time)but has never really met one.  Still, someone in Hollywood said, \\\"uh oh, better give this to a Gay director or Gay People will make trouble.\\\" So they handed it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against the man, but -- however Gay he may really be -- he has not a clue as to how to make a funny film. Gus Van Sant took a straight man's playful fantasy of guilt-free girl/girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull, literal-minded Lesbian Power Recruiting Poster. It's like turning an Oscar Wilde comedy into an Arthur Miller tragedy. Not pretty.  The main clue that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting. His clout allowed him to hire the very best. His ignorance of the novel's real subtext (a straight man's fantasy, not a gay pride recruiting poster)caused him to make choices that were not only bad, but bizarre.  Let's meet the cast of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES.  PAT MORITA as \\\"THE CHINK\\\" Okay, there are few name-recognition Asian actors. And Pat Morita, in HAPPY DAYS, was fairly funny. But casting him as THE CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that the Chink is a very funny man. (Gus didn't tell him.) Pat also doesn't seem to know that the Chink is . . . well, SEXY!!! In the book he's not wise old Mr. Miyagi. He's more like Hugh Hefner! He's a randy old goat and he knows A LOT about pleasing the nubile and responsive Sissy AND Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, they aren't REALLY lesbians. Do you get that this is a straight man's fantasy yet?)   JOHN HURT as \\\"THE COUNTESS.\\\" Okay, he's a gay friendly man. But he is a SERIOUS, SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR!!!! You need someone who is fun, and camp, for this role. For John Hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the Countess is tragic and sad. I kept expecting Paul Scofield to wander in all dressed up as Thomas More, and sadly shake his head. \\\"Now, Richard, you know you've lost your soul entirely. For shame, my former student!\\\" And yes, John Hurt was funny (and pretty gay) as Caligula. But that was BLACK humor, not playful and breezy humor like the book.  RAIN PHOENIX as \\\"Bonanza Jellybean.\\\" No talent, no training, no problem. Except that in the book Bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual, and loving. In the movie she's sullen, passive, expressionless, and dull. As for her taste for women, Robbins in the book puts it like this. \\\"God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits.\\\" Uh, Gus? Did you read this book?   UMA THURMAN as \\\"Sissy Hankshaw.\\\" This is a tough role. In the book Sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine. Still, a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye, or a sway in her walk, to imply some sort of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures. Uma doesn't pull it off, probably because Gus never told her Sissy is supposed to ENJOY being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. Uma plays it more like she's in a TV movie about a girl dying of leukemia.   This movie is sour and dull.

Thompson's book, I can't judge Gonzo journalism or his writings, but I will point out my problems with this movie.  For me, \\\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\\" was nothing but 2 hours with two unlikable AND uninteresting characters doing all kinds of drugs. The occasional good moments and the reason why I don't give it an even lower rating happen thanks to the narration and an inspired, brief black-and-white footage from the 60's, the great soundtrack, plus Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro's performances (even though I could never relate to their characters, they fitted them perfectly). I can be fascinated by an unlikable character that I can't personally relate to when it's well written into a gripping character-study (as, say, Isabelle Huppert's complex Erica Kohut in \\\"The Piano Teacher\\\"), but that won't happen if they are also completely uninteresting and lack any sort of substance. People who consider the so-called \\\"druggie lifestyle\\\" a shock to the system and a form of artistic expression will most likely enjoy this (and there are lots of them, hence the major cult surrounding this movie), but I was bored or indifferent most of the time. Films like Dennis Hopper's \\\"Easy Rider\\\" (which didn't age very well in my opinion, but still keeps a rugged charm of 60's anarchy) and Danny Boyle's \\\"Trainspotting\\\" portrayed those \\\"trips\\\" and a whole generation without ever being dull. That said, I can see why some people love this movie... but if you have to dig such an empty \\\"lifestyle\\\" (hedonism? I don't think doing drugs all day long should be called that, sounds more like apathy to me) to appreciate it, then this is definitely not my cup of tea. 4/10.\", \"To me this movie is quite unique in a special way. I bought it about a year ago as it seemed \\\"interesting\\\" and I had wanted to see it for some time. Twice have I tried to watch it without being able to finish it...and I hardly ever do this no matter how bad a movie gets. And this is the peculiar part because Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not the worst movie I've \\\"seen\\\". My experience has been this (twice): I start watching it and it's hilarious for about half an hour. Then it flattens out. It doesn't change after this half hour, it just gets old really fast and I get the feeling that it's not moving forward. After about an hour it's like \\\"enough already - get on with it!\\\" and \\\"OK OK - I know now that you have a lot of different drugs with different effects, will anything actually happen soon?\\\". The acting is good, and Depp is...well he's different than how you usually see him, and yet the same - he always gets a part in those mystical movies. I'm actually close to being a Depp fan, but I'm sorry to say that I still haven't been able to keep this movie rolling to the end, or at least I can't remember an end to it. My advice is to see for yourself. The movie is unique to say the least.

It is worth it just to see Black Flag's punk rock supper star Henry Rollins in this now cult classic. This film kills and puts your mind on a stick to shock and awe you into submission. It is the perfect date-movie if you don't like bugs and you do like blood, booze and boobs. John Gulager is the next Alfred Hitchcock for the Y-Generation. This film marks the return to the screen of the Director's brilliant Father, Clu Gulager, it is as if \\\"The Last Picture Show\\\" met \\\"Phantasim\\\" on No-Doz & DMT. This film has more depth then \\\"The Blair Witch Project\\\" or \\\"Shawn of the Dead\\\" and it's just as brutal and sick as \\\"Jacob's Ladder\\\" but funnier then the fire extinguisher scene in the French film \\\"Irr\\u00e9versible\\\". This is the vomit-fest magic roller coaster ride that horror fans still go to the front row of a theater to see. So enjoy this well crafted vis-queen splattered masterpiece that the Director, Production Designer, Cast and Crew worked so hard on. Remember that this movie was made with the added stress of a reality television show looking over their shoulders. Ultimately though it is the performance of Diane Goldner, the real heroin of both this film and the TV show, that made this the first big hit of \\\"Project Green Light\\\" and I eagerly await her return... in the up coming \\\"Feast 2: Sloppy Seconds\\\" (still in production) as the Biker Queen this time instead of the Harley Mom in \\\"Feast\\\"(2005).\", \"I've only just got around to watching this film - 3 years after its release but it was worth the wait.  I wasn't too sure what to expect. I'd heard good things about the film but it seemed that it was a little bit of a horror genre clich\\u00e9. So I was ready to give up before it was halfway through. Im glad I didn't.  If you're a fan of the genre then you wont be expecting Oscar nominated performances from the cast or a script that will stand the passage of decades. That said, the performances are all above par and the the script is quite clever and amusing in places.  If you're like me than you really need to relate to the main protagonists or there has to be a 'hook' which piques your curiosity. The first 10 minutes where you are literally 'introduced' to the main characters is a fantastic hook and I knew then that I was going to enjoy the film.  The film starts well and it doesn't let up for almost an hour and a half. You really do have not a clue whether any or all of the characters are going to get out alive. And yes there are several stereotypes on show but that clever script I mentioned earlier throws up surprise after surprise. Just when you're thinking 'I know whats going to happen now ....' it doesn't.  For those that like their blood - there is plenty of it! And although its a little OTT in places it never quite gets too silly.  All in all its well worth catching and is a welcome addition to the genre.  8 out of 10\", \"WARNING:I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.  I thought Feast was a satisfying film.I will say I was just a little disappointed, because I was expecting a tad bit more, but still, it was very enjoyable, and even though at some parts I felt as if they overdid some stuff a bit, it contained cool action scenes, and I believe really lovable characters.Also, they kind of throw you off guard, and do some of the things that you least expect, such as how they killed of Heroine, which when I thought since she was like, one of the most important characters of the story, they would've kept her alive, and also at the part where one of the creatures devours that child, I wasn't expecting that either, which I believe was clever that they were able to do that.There was even pretty laughable comedy, which one of the best mixes of genre is Horror/Comedy, and like I said before, I was really into the characters, like the old woman and Tuffy were some of my favorites in Feast.This was a good movie, and I think it has a pretty reasonable rating, so I have nothing further to say, except that if you absolutely flat out hated this movie, you DEFINITELY need to watch it again, and maybe you'll see the error of your ways.\", \"From start to finish, this movie was a cartoon. It was like watching an episode of \\\"Courage the Cowardly Dog\\\" or the Halloween episodes of all the other Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon regulars. But it was live action, without toning down any of the gory moments for children, and that made it amazing! This is a sad day in all movie genres. Originality is dead. People hail horror movies like The Descent and The Mist, ignoring the fact 95% of the movies could have been copy/pasted from the last monster movie that held its run. The fact that this movie takes those clich\\u00e9s and actually laughs in their face, I can't help but enjoy it. People sit around and say, \\\"Oh, it's not original, but what is anymore?\\\" instead of taking a risk and making something that IS original.  Feast isn't original, but it challenges movie makers to be original by making fun of them. Contrary to the countless \\\"gory\\\" movies like 30 Days of Night, the makers of Feast honestly have balls because they do what the others don't: be different.  That's not saying this movie is gory; it really isn't. It's pretty genetic and family friendly. I'd be hard-pressed to say the gore in this movie is much more over-the-top than the new Indiana Jones movie. Simply put, the gore is more than most movies, but it's so generic it really isn't that gory.  That's the only complaint I have. The rest is cartoony, art house fun.  3/10\", \"I actually enjoyed this a lot. It is not your average horror flick, and it does have some elements of surprise in it as well. The characters are nicely played and fits well into this movie. It has a lot of great gore scenes and some good humor too. The monsters are not too bad either. Even though there are no explanation to them, it still does not matter, as the movie just circles around the characters, and their battle to survive... which in fact never gets boring.   All in all I can definitely recommend this for horror buffs, especially if you are looking for something more than just \\\"Hi, I'm Candy, I'm a teenager, and I like to go down to basements and get naked before I get killed by the big scary serial killer\\\" kindda movies.  Well worth my time. I can only hope the followup will be as good as this.\", \"Feast is the brain child of Project Greenlight--a horror film which attempts to capture the essence of classic horror films while at the same time putting a contemporary and gory spin on things. I am a fan of B-movies, whether they be over-the-top gorefests, in which the hero or heroin must overcome impossible odds, or the slapstick humor that sometimes accompanies such horror flicks.  The reason Feast fails is because it did neither for me while watching. I never found myself intrigued by the monsters save the very beginning, never found myself laughing, and never once said \\\"Wow i have never seen that kind of death before!\\\" While there are various hints of humor through out the film, none are intelligent to illicit even a slight smile. The plot and mysteriousness of the monsters is abruptly ruined, and the viewer is left with horrible special effects--which is okay--but absolutely no lead up to an action filled moment, IE: It is not scary.  The director's attempts at surprise fall painfully short, as the ending is just as predictable as any other B-movie out there. The only redeeming quality in this film is the highly stylistic approach from the director as far as characterization goes, as well as a Scanner esquire head explosion. It is as if the director tried to capture the B-movie demographic, but went so over the top the movie failed miserably.  This review is from a true horror fan, and I am giving it a 3/10.\", \"Feast was super cool to watch. A local rundown bar in the middle of nowhere is a barfly and lowlife hangout with one out of town slick talker. Little does the motley crew inside getting tanked know whatsa coming there way. A family of creatures hungry for human flesh flavored with beer. A ton of blood for fans of gore. Feast don't try to be no Saw. I LMAO for real at a jokes they said. It was way funny how the own of town talker gives those lame pep talks you heard in high school about being a team player. I never took my eyes of Feast. Didn't wanna miss any gore or jokes. Coolest was when whatever those creatures were had porn sex outside, Funny as all hell. Tell a friend about Feast.\", \"A bunch of people in a bar are slightly distressed when a blood-covered, shotgun-wielding \\\"hero\\\" bursts in and warns them all about ravenous, speedy creatures travelling not far behind him. The patrons are rather disbelieving until one creature gets inside and proceeds to try and eat as many people as it can.  This film starts off quickly and doesn't really let up for it's duration. It's a lot of fun and I loved the mix of humour and nasty gore moments (the brief bios of each person were particularly enjoyable). The editing was a little bit choppy at times but everything else was well done. And kudos to a real mixed-bag cast (including Balthazar Getty, Henry Rollins and Jason Mewes playing . . . Jason Mewes) who embrace the material with gusto and totally go along with the humour of the project. It's a bit of a no-brainer with no comment on our society of today or underlying, deeper story strands. Sometimes, that is just what you need from your horrors. I'd happily recommend this to any horror fan and was glad to see it at last.  See this if you like: Tremors, Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight, Slither.  NB, this review was adapted from the original written under my old RockySchlockyRobot ID that I have long forgotten how to access.\", \"In a overview of Feast. I can at least say this....  Don't expect your average run of the mill claustrophobic horror movie.   This movie has way too much sense of humor for it to be politically correct. Don't take this movie seriously.  Creatures kill whoever is convenient for them and don't expect anyone to be safe. Attacks are random and could keep you at the edge of your seat.  Don't expect abuse of CGI. Classic monster costuming and effects are used.  Expect the unexpected.  Feast does its best to throw all Horror clich\\u00e9s out the window yet it doesn't try to be anything it is not meant to be.  Henry Rollins is in this. Haven't seen him in a loooong time.  I recommend this movie for the above reasons mentioned. Don't take this movie seriously and enjoy.\", \"Having seen the Project Greenlight series about the making of this film, I had very low expectations for the final product. The director was portrayed as amateurish, and his stubborn attempts to cast his unproven actress girlfriend in the movie seemed to support that charge.  In retrospect, it seems that the Weinsteins sacrificed any shot at successfully distributing this film theatrically in favor of exploiting it as TV fodder. A rare misfire from the usually brilliant media moguls. Had they been brave and supported this movie, they might have ended up with a mega-million dollar theatrical franchise like Nightmare on Elm Street, instead of a straight-to-vid release.  A classic B horror film, FEAST serves up heaping helpings of cheap thrills in lieu of long-winded \\\"back stories\\\" which thrill development girls and story editors but leave horror fans snoring in their popcorn. The character development is clever and perfunctory, introducing a dozen characters with minimal fuss and maximum efficiency--colorful characters worthy of a (good) Tarantino flick.  The script is fast-paced and the direction captures the tone of it perfectly. The real fun starts just a few minutes into the first act, and keeps on pumping throughout the film, with just enough lulls in the action to reset the audience for more.  The cast is superb all around, with luscious ladies and hunky guys playing it for all its worth. Thankfully, whatever humor there is is not the insipid one-liner crap or tedious reflexive humor that's dragged the genre down for the past twenty years.  The EFX are topnotch, and the cinematography is outstanding, giving the film a bigger budget feel and greatly enhancing the limited number of sets.  Although some may disagree with the lack of a \\\"back story\\\" of the monsters, they were no more mysterious than the creatures in ALIEN, another film in which there was no way for the protagonists to learn more about their foes without contrived and boring exposition.  I can't wait to check out John Gulager's other films, and hope he gets a chance to expand into bigger budgets which he deserves. I also hope he stays in horror and doesn't lose his edge, because there are far too few consistent directors in the genre.\", \"Im actually watching the movie as I write this, I felt compelled to pick up my laptop and vent my frustration out on how CRAP this movie is. It tries to be funny and fails it tries to be Scary and cocks that up too. True 3 of the cast are very good looking women but the story is Bollox and the acting is awful.  I saw Matt Damon and Ben Afleck's names associated with this flick? why? what did they do, walk past a guy who went to see this god awful sh~%t flick cos they never looked at the script thats for damn sure. I am now off to take a dump which I know will be more enjoyable with a better ending than Feast (a bag of W.a.n.k)\", \"Since a lot of movie buffs seems to have seen this film, and gave it mostly positive reviews. I decided to give it a try, and I sure wasn't disappointed. The film starts out with all these guys at a bar and they aren't the typical type of people hanging out at a bars either, they are a bit awkward and unreal but at the same time hilarious. And it gives a introduction for each one of the characters even if they won't last a minute, which at first I found to be a bit annoying but once action gets started, you actually really start to appreciate the introductions it showed. Another aspect that sets this horror film from others is that the action starts, almost right from the beginning without the tedious nonsense in some horror films to get the audience to somewhat care about the characters that are trying to survive. This film is a ambiguous, ballsy and hysterical gore fest that will keep you grinning from beginning to end and to top it off the action starts real quick. What I really liked about this film is that it broke just about every rule in the survivor horror genre and sort of does a parody of it making fun it. Also just about every character in this film that are trying to survive isn't really normal but actually quite memorable, cause they go over the top with the generic survival horror types of characters. This is a film you gotta watch with your buddies to get the most enjoyment out at night with it's crude humor, it's a B movie that is most definitely worth checking out, especially if your a horror movie fan.  7.6/10\", \"The movie started off with some funny promos at the beginning introducing the characters and letting us know who will probably die first. Very original.  I think of Clu Gulager, and I think of westerns, but in his more that 150 roles, he's done it all, including the bartender in this film and the two sequels. yes, there is more of this coming.  The action starts hot and heavy when Eric Dane walks into the bar with one of the creatures. The blood is copious and decapitation is immediate. There is also a lot of disgusting slime. The patrons in the bar spend the next 90 minutes battling the monster family. Continuous action throughout. This was excitement to the nth degree! Those creatures sure were ugly! Can't wait to see Feast II, but, unfortunately, it won't have Navi Rawat, but Jenny Wade will be back.\", \"'Feast' is one of those horror movies that redefine a certain genre.In this case, 'Feast' redefines the man eating monster genre.The monsters in this film snatch up their victims one by one in grizzly and gory fashions.Even a young boy meets his own brutal fate.The monsters move so fast when they kill someone that you can hardly see them.Maybe you can see glimpses of them, but that's about it.Now that was a problem for me.'The Descent' managed to show the monster's faces and they were pretty ugly.In this movie, You can only see their whole face either near the end of the middle or in the end.I must admit that I had some fun with this movie.I will plan on seeing the sequels even though they did not get as good reviews as this one.\", \"In the middle of nowhere at a bar, the costumers including Barkeeper (Clu Gulagar) are enjoying the booze until a mysterious man breaks in and warns them of creatures coming to kill them. They don't believe in him until a bizarre creature kills one of the costumers as each person must try to stay alive and inside the bar as possible to ward off these flesh-eating beasts.  Exciting and gory-as-hell action-horror comedy is one of the better horror flicks of late. From executive producers Wes Craven, Chris Moore, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon this is an adrenaline pumping roller-coaster that harks back to the old school style monster movie days. Sure the movie may seem plot less even with no explanation of where the monsters come from until the sequels, but it's good quality entertainment for fans of the genre. The film co-stars Pulp Fiction's Dwayne Witaker, Judah Friedlander, Henry Rollins and Balthazar Getty (\\\"Alias\\\") as they give all great performances. I love how the creatures are more traditional style then CGI which doesn't seem to be realistic, i do admire CGI unless it's well done. The gore is non-stop in a cartoony \\\"Dead Alive\\\" or \\\"Re-Animator\\\" kind of way as you see Eyeballs ripped out, heads blowing up and so much blood you need an umbrella.  I highly recommend this throwback to old school horror movies to any fan, it's great fun.  Also recommended: \\\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\\", \\\"CHUD\\\", \\\"Re-Animator\\\", \\\"Evil Dead 1 & 2\\\", \\\"The Toxic Avenger\\\", \\\"Basket Case\\\", \\\"It's Alive (1974)\\\", \\\"The Mist\\\", \\\"Pumpkinhead\\\", \\\"Demons 1 & 2\\\", \\\"Dawn of the Dead (1978 and 2004)\\\", \\\"Night of the Living Dead (1968 and 1990)\\\", \\\"Hatchet\\\", \\\"Slither\\\", \\\"Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead\\\", \\\"Diary of the Dead\\\", \\\"Street Trash\\\", \\\"Day of the Dead (1985)\\\", \\\"The Blob (1988)\\\", \\\"The Descent\\\", \\\"The Pit\\\", \\\"Bad Taste\\\", \\\"The Thing (1982)\\\", \\\"Grindhouse\\\", \\\"The Host\\\" and \\\"The Hills Have Eyes (1977 and 2006)\\\".\", \"Can someone please tell me what the \\\"heck\\\" this movie is about? I am a HUGE blood and gore fan but this was thoroughly a disappointment. It had no \\\"real\\\" plot....no story line.........it wasn't even worth the DVD rental of $4.00! HUGE, HUGE disappointment. I noticed that it had some \\\"names\\\" associated with it like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Did these guys even bother to read the script? and if they did...they should have just taken the money they invested in this and burned it....at least they would have gotten more from it. I definitely would not recommend this movie to anyone! In fact it was so bad I actually took it back to my video rental place and requested my money back. Horror fans...stay far away from this one. It's just a waste of time.\", \"I've never thought after From Dusk Till Dawn that someone would try to make a clone of that movie. Actually, Gulager and Project Greenlight did.  This movie is about monsters invading a pub full of miserable losers. Well, the fountain of my problems is found in the last two words. Yes, the characters! Totally indifferent people, whose fate is totally indifferent, whom we don't care about if they survive or not. Awful dialogues and a truly miserable plot describes the whole movie - every element has been seen elsewhere, mostly in Romero's NotLD and Rodriguez's From Dusk..., but they've been put together to make a totally indifferent film, that makes you think: who cares who dies? Who cares what happens? Why didn't they just all die, it wouldn't have done anything different for you.  The other problem beside the high level of indifference and the pathetic characters is the bad editing. During action scenes this makes the movie so quick we don't even know what happens, can't see a thing. The only good point is gore, which is not limited, that's why I give more than 1 star. But avoid this movie at all costs!\", \"If you look at the credits, FEAST has 20 producers.  20.  TWENTY!!!   And even with all these producers, none of them could have come up with a better film. FEAST is disturbingly awful. Disturbingly awful because there's simply no point to this aside from the fact that it screams \\\"hey, we're doing a \\\"horror\\\" film here, folks\\\". It's not scary or anything but just flip and showy.  The characters, or I should call them types, are devoid of anything resembling human beings. They see people being killed all around them and most go on as if nothing happened. Limbs are cut, heads are ripped from bodies and most people, not all, but most just stand around, unfazed. Please. The basis of horror is how people react to what's going around them and what might happen to them. If the characters do not react in a remotely normal way (even for a supposed \\\"horror comedy\\\" like this piece o' crap), there's no \\\"horror\\\" just plain stupidity, which this \\\"film\\\" has in spades.  I'm glad I didn't have to pay to see this piece of crap.\", \"I tried to indulge in Feast: Unrated, the latest Project Greenlight, umm...project from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (co-created with Wes Craven, the horror movie genius behind the Nightmare on Elm Street saga and the Scream Trilogy--still one of the best mystery-slashers ever made, even with the degenerating quality and originality that is seemingly inherent in sequels). The movie starts out on a good note, with frighteningly funny character profiles, including name, occupation, useful skills, and life expectancy (which, with giant, skinless, ravenous monsters heading their way, won't be very long). Otherwise, the few scares are predictable and the presentation of the film indicates more influence by Kevin Smith than Wes Craven. Among the more obvious pieces of evidence for this are a severed monster-penis flopping around the barroom floor like a hooked salmon, the constant Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back-style stream of F-bombs, and (one of the only meaningful chips off the Smith block) the banding together of various freaks, stoners, ass-kickers, and other aggrandized specimens of dysfunctional human normalcy to pursue the common goal of living whatever life there is to live. It's quite fascinating how many weapons one can find or make in a bar, but if you're looking to be good and scared, don't waste your money; Evil Bong is a better investment.\", \"this movie was just violence for the sake of violence! it was boring,with an un original story line! Also.. don't bother trying to eat anything while watching this movie! u would think Hollywood would be getting tired of making movies like this! being a big movie buff myself!!...i can tell you i have seen them all. this one didn't do a thing for me and i have to wonder how it would for anyone. they could have done better if they had just thrown fake blood all over an old house and filmed it! One has to wonder if Hollywood is running out of imagination or just getting lazy! the money for this film would has served better going to a charity! there was nothing impressive with the acting,storyline,or even visual effects for me. So in all this movie gets a poor rating in my book.\", \"So ignorant it could be true if it wasn't so stupid. Pumping baby beasts, sick and a waste of time and brain power. Actors were needing a payday so the producers must have felt sorry for them. Film had no plot just gorry action that was at a D level. Executive Producers must not have anything else to do than this. Where did they get the creatures from, the Bruce Willis movie about the future cab driver that used to be a soldier but now helps the savior of the world? To be a horror film of Wes Cravens this is awful. Where did his style go? His artist touch? Man I don't know how many things I can write bad about this film just to get 10 lines . Well ONE MORE TIME, this film is awful, gross and substandard.\", \"Getting right to the point, this movie was a huge letdown in my eyes. I have been making my way through some horror movies I had not seen yet (May, A Tale of Two Sisters, etc...) when I ran across this title. It was ranked on a lot of top horror movie lists, but after watching I can honestly say I don't understand why. The filmmakers seem like they can't figure out what sub-genre they want to end up with. This movie struggles between being a gore horror (succeeding in some parts but overall trying too hard), a dark comedy (a bad one at that), and a deeper movie than what it is by trying to develop character depth (epic fail).  I gave this movie some stars because it does manage to introduce some elements that could have been good, if the movie wouldn't have had so many negative qualities. The gore succeeds at times, but as I said before overall it feels forced and given the attempts at comedy and character development, doesn't feel like a gore horror. The movie also gives brief biographies of each character, but this becomes redundant after the first 3-4 and by the time they are all done, you're wondering why they did so many. The cinematography is good in some areas when it is not shaking from cut scene to cut scene so fast that it makes you wonder if you are having a seizure or watching a movie.  Sadly, the monsters in this movie look too much like the creatures from the \\\"Alien\\\" series to give credit to the filmmakers. For the life of me, I still see no reason why the monsters decide to wear clothing and bulls heads when the bull skulls don't even cover where their heads are located. Though a small gripe and not a defining factor for my rating, it still bothers me that creatures which hump items at random, eat humans whole, and throw up on people have some sort of issue with not wearing clothing.  If you're looking for a good horror movie and have not seen many, I would recommend looking elsewhere. If you're simply a horror movie fan like myself who has seen many and is looking for something that has slipped through the cracks.....I'd still suggest looking elsewhere. If you're trying to prolong going to get that root canal done but have ran out of other things to procrastinate with though, this is less painful. I give this movie a 4/10 because it simply takes itself too seriously to write it off as a dark comedy, but not seriously enough to be a good horror movie.\", \"This little gem has just been released straight to DVD in Britain which is a travesty. It deserved to be seen in a cinema. The film shows that horror and comedy do go hand in hand if done well and this film does it perfectly. From the great character bios some of the more gruesome deaths this film has its tongue firmly in its cheek. The cast are top notch with some of the best comedy moments coming from watching the surprise deaths. It breaks a lot of the horror rules with who survives and who doesn't. The gore and special effects are fantastic. The film itself is paced perfectly with very little explanation as to why or what exactly is happening. I love finding a film of this calibre. It shows that you don't need to remake a Asian film with a huge budget in order to make a good movie. Watch it and enjoy it!!!\", \"I was lucky enough to see this film at the Savannah Film Festival on Halloween and hopefully it will be lucky enough to get show in theaters. The film is the result of the TV show Project Green Light, but don't let that thwart you. I went in with the skepticism that I give all the horror movies these days and was pleased that it did not involve an evil child that glitches around the screen. This movie tears down the clich\\u00e9s of its predecessors and is provides non stop excitement from beginning to end. A great mix of horror, action, and comedy. The diverse cast is as good as the ways they are off'd. Well, reality TV has finally done something for me, now it can go away.\", \"This movie was an unexpected hit for me. I really enjoy every minute of this film from start to finish. It had a feeling of From Dusk to Dawn to even a Quentin Tarantino film. It's the first horror/monster movie that I have seen in a really long time that was actually good. I do not understand why it's having a hard time getting distribution. There are so many crap films out there right now that get distribution, especially films in the horror genre. Please people if you get to see this movie go and see it. It's worth your time and money. It's very funny also and never takes itself too seriously which helps the movie in the long run. The monsters never are called anything else but monsters and that's refreshing. No drawn out back story, just right to the point action, comedy, and suspense. Please again if you get a chance to see this film go see it. Spread the word to help the director, writers, and producers of this film to get it some distribution. If you were a fan of the Project Greenlight television show then actually go see the movie.\", \"I saw this film tonight at the Savannah Film Festival and I loved it. I'm not really into horror movies but this was just a good movie. It was funny, suspenseful, and well-made. I watched Project Greenlight and was not really expecting much tonight and I had a great time. This movie should definitely be released in theaters very soon. The entire audience of probably 800 people was very into it and gave it a standing ovation at the end. The studio made a big mistake not releasing it in time for Halloween. John Gulager, Mike Leahy, and Dianne who played Harley Momma have been here all weekend trying to get the word out about the movie and they have definitely been the toast of the festival.\", \"I had a chance to catch a screening of \\\"Feast\\\" at the Chicago Film Festival. I hadn't caught the latest installment of Project Greenlight and hadn't even heard of the movie until a week ago, so I came in without any expectations.   At the least, it's got cult classic written all over it: --campy, smart writing --quirky characters that are developed enough to give them dimension without plummeting the depths of their personalities (it is a horror flick) --a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously --outrageously funny (more than you can say of other cult classics that have somehow survived)...I haven't laughed out loud that much since Meet the Parents (the original!) --totally scared the crap out of me numerous times --a plot that defies predictability, but doesn't collapse as a result of it  And for all those reasons, there's got to be a good chance it's at least going to be a sleeper hit...one that certainly appeals to the horror flick crowd, but is smart enough to draw others (like myself) that are just looking for a great, well-written, well-produced movie. Add the project greenlight junkies to that eclectic mix of audience draw...and, tell me again, why are the studios having trouble releasing it?\", \"I just saw this at the first annual Fantastic Fest Film Festival in Austin, Texas and I liked it so much I felt compelled to write a review of it.  This is simply one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. I don't know much about film distribution, but it amazes and saddens me that this isn't in wide release ranking somewhere in the top 10 current films. Horror movies usually don't scare me, but this one genuinely did. It was also really funny, and the way the movie plays with character stereotypes had me guessing as to which character was going to get it next. There were moments when I was seriously shocked by the blatant violation of standard horror conventions. It takes real talent to play with clich\\u00e9s so effectively. Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a straight to video deal either, this is a well crafted and filmed movie. If you like genre films like Evil Dead, Tremors, or just like horror in general, you HAVE to check this one out, if you get a chance. Unfortunately, you may have to wait for DVD.\", \"I saw this movie last night at the Chicago Film Festival. This movie is not one that will change lives or addresses pressing social issues. Though it would be easy for somebody to say that it is a metaphor for our day and time with terrorist threats and all, but somebody even could do that with Cheaper by the Dozen. So anyway about Feast, it's a great film to watch.  The premise is very simple a bunch of strangers are locked in a bar for the night as monsters try and get in. There really isn't much more to it and that is where the beauty of this film lies. I have heard that Marcus, one of the writers described this as a movie that you start watching on TBS at 2 am and you don't finish, which is a great description for it.   The performances are pretty strong because the actors seem so relaxed in them. The best performances come from Balthazar Getty, Duane Whitaker, Clu Gulgar, Krista Allen, and Josh Zuckerman. The work of the Thomas L Callaway the cinematographer is great, especially in the final showdown scene, some may complain about not being able to see but the red color that covers the scene is great. The final shot of Krista Allen behind the rising sun is just beautiful, even if it is only a simple horror movie.   The main credit goes to John Gulager, whom despite all the \\\"drama\\\" shown on Project Greenlight, has crafted a really enjoyable film. He took all the raw elements of the production and crafted just an amazing final product. This is a movie that I will suggest to people who just want to enjoy themselves in a theater.\", \"Saw this film at the International Horror & Sci-Fi Festival in Tempe, Arizona last night. This is the first film that I have seen from the \\\"Project Greenlight\\\" series. Since the film was made for only a million bucks, I expected \\\"Feast\\\" to be loaded with lots of things that would show that it was shot on a low budget. Well, there wasn't any CGI special effects and 99% of this film was shot inside the bar, but other than that, I didn't feel anything else was compromised that would affect the quality of the film. In fact, this film kicks more butt than most multi-million dollar horror and sci-fi flicks! \\\"Feast\\\" takes place inside a bar in the middle of the California desert. At one moment, a bloodied man shows up with a dead creature in his hand. He says there are four of them, he doesn't know what they are or where they came from, except that they devour and kill anybody they see. Within minutes, the creatures suddenly show up, the carnage begins and all hell breaks loose.  What I liked most about this film was the comical intros for all the lead characters: \\\"hero\\\", \\\"loser\\\", \\\"expects nothing in life\\\" etc.  Director John Gulager and one of the writers, Marcus Dunstan, chatted with the audience after the screening. According to John, the film was scheduled for a January 2006 release. Unfortunately, the turmoil at the film's distributors has put \\\"Feast\\\" on the shelf at least for now. Hopefully, something could be done to get this film out to the public, word of mouth is already out and \\\"Feast\\\" stands to make millions at the box office.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Frances\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0083967\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Frankenstein\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0021884\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"From Dusk Till Dawn\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0116367\", \"total_review_count\": 8, \"total_rating_count\": 8, \"review_content\": [\"It's a long time ago I saw this movie and still it's one of the worst I've ever seen. I like lots of kind of movies; sci-fi, action, drama, thrillers and sometimes even horror. Not a combination of two. This could have been a wonderful movie, but they all blew it up. I didn't want to see this movie, but friends of mine insisted to watch it. I didn't know it was such a crap. I loved the first part, in which Clooney and Tarantino drove through Texas, killing everybody on their way (especially the scene with the liquor shooting was excellent), but at its turning point, in the titty twister bar everything changed. Stupid Vampires took over the place and what could have been a perfect gangster movie became a stupid horror movie like 'Nightmare on Elmsteet'. If you like horror, watch a real horror movie. And when you love bloodstolling thrillers don't watch it at all, you will be very disappointed at the end.\", \"This film is simply appalling, how the talent involved made this is beyond human belief.Iguess they must have been boozing when they thought of this idea,I feel as if 2 hours of my life have been taken from me.Harvey Kietel will try and distance himself from this rubbish, it should have been a great crime movie but it develops into a gory mess of vampires.I would recommend this film to people who like to sleep through movies ,you wont miss a thing.The humour is set to appeal to the lowest common dominate, movies can uplift us and remind us that life is worth living, this film just depresses you.As DeNiro said in one movie the saddest thing in life is wasted talent this film is a perfect example of this statement.\", \"WARNING:I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.  When I first started to watch this movie my expectations were it was a vampire movie, that is going to be awesome considering how Rodriguez and Tarantino both helped make the film. I began about 15 minutes into it and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain, which shocked me. First, the story it was going with was not at all appealing in anyway possible, and just flat out boring and uncompelling to the point where I just wanted to turn it off. I was getting more frustrated with this movie as it dragged on, but I guess I had hopes that it would get better.... then when it finally showed vampires it BLEW MY MIND, in a VERY bad way. I thought,\\\"Okay this movie started with some backwash horrible story about these two criminals, then VERY slowly turned into some vampire movie which I thought it was going to be from the beginning, in like, the last 30 minutes?\\\" To add on to that, they try to make the main characters all cool and awesome and mean around the end when they're just not; A bunny would've been more intimidating than these characters! This movie is a horrible piece of crap!!! From Dusk Till dawn disgraced me and left a terrible taste in my mouth, disheartening thoughts in my head, and left my body unable to move from the horrible shock that I just wasted 108 minutes of my life away on a horrendous film. I do not understand how George Clooney, Quentin Tarintino, Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, all being the good and honorable actors that they are, could take part in this useless filth. In my opinion, From Dusk Till Dawn is one of the worst movies ever made that I have suffered my eyes on. Do not see it, you'll be doing yourelf a GREAT favor...\", \"I love dissing this movie. My peers always try their best to defend it, probably out of love for Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they'll never convince me that this one should be treasured. Here's some huge reasons why: A: The plot goes from kidnapping road trip movie to vampire-inhabited strip bar slasher flick with no set-up whatsoever. Suddenly something very real turns into something very fake, which is like sitting the audience down to a Thanksgiving feast then exploding it with dynamite. B: That untalented Juliette Lewis is in it. C: Preposterous ideas abound such as actual torso-and-leg guitars, brothers with the last name \\\"Gecko,\\\" bad vampire make-up jobs, Cheech Marin playing three characters (?), and a crotch-based gun that only fires when \\\"erect\\\" and belongs to a guy who goes by \\\"Sex Machine.\\\" If Robert Rodriguez didn't pathetically try to be so innovative with his violence, I might've had fun with this obvious popcorn flick. The whole project's like he got the ideas by playing with action figures. The only thing even close to being considered my favorite scene is George Clooney's laugh-out-loud cheesy monologue after he kills his blood-sucking, horny-for-children, terrible-acting brother. I swear I think they thought it up right then and there. This movie's out to offend, and ends up offending those who want the offensive. Horrible movie.\", \"What could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director ... there were so many directions that the movie could have taken ... a vampire slash-fest was not one of these!!! The last 45 mins. or so results in the movie being an absolutely ridiculous waste of time. ...and sex machine?? ... you gotta be kidding me! The acting talents of the likes of Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel (not to mention George Clooney) are completely wasted in this nonsensical movie.   The director... Robert Rodriguez, known for his other gory flicks including el mariachi, desperado, once upon a time in Mexico, and the very recent sin city ... really holds your attention with the well executed first half ... which leads you to believe that you are in for an entertaining time ... but then apparently for no reason, and without any provocation, the madness starts ... there's even feeble attempts at parody and comedy ... truly exasperating!!\", \"Just what is the point of this film? It starts off as one film, then changes track, cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other schlock-horror flicks you've ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. Screenplay by Tarantino, direction by Rodriguez, two guys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because THEY did it. But it doesn't quite work that way. You're only good while you continue doing good things. There are so many questions to ask: Just what are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck? Clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy \\u0097 utterly ruthless and efficient \\u0097 and it would have been interesting to see where that was going. But, of course, we never do. And the Clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character. That's not clever or witty, that's just bad, bad work. Keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout, and no wonder. Did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the go-ahead? Tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant (and why did he, as writer, assume we would find the rape, gruesome murder and butchering of an inoffensive hostage funny). On every level \\u0097 except the technical \\u0097 this film stinks. Avoid.\", \"This was not a good movie!! Why do you people keep saying that? There is a nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires!!! Why? Why are there vampires? Where did they come from? Also, what the hell?! There are all of these \\\"super human\\\" vampires but George Clooney and three other random guys dominate ALL of them. Quickly too. It's not like there was a long fight scene with lots of struggle. There was just three dudes from the bar killing these vampires like a fat man kills twinkies! The next thing you know, Clooney and the stupid girl are rescued by Cheech and leaves the family-less homeless in the middle of Mexico. End of story. Literally. Oh and the strip club was an Aztec temple which is funny because that would have to be southern Mexico not the border. Why are you people lying and telling people this is a good movie? Do not rent, buy or even watch this movie at a friend's house. You will wish you had that time of your life back.\", \"I watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand. I was intrigued for the first whole hour. It was shaping up to be a great thriller. A very talented cast and good dialogue.Then it all fell apart for me at the sight of the first vampire. I couldn't believe my eyes.A great thriller was flushed down the toilet. The rest of the movie from that point was totally awful.  I gave it 4 stars for the brilliant beginning alone. I think that's a little generous, but I was entertained for a while.

I suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a \\\"feel-good\\\" film on gender equality. Indeed a recent commentator stated: \\\"it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do.\\\" What claptrap! No one, man or woman can do anything they want to do, and unfortunately Demi Moore \\\"buffing\\\" up for SEAL Hell Week in the early 27 week BUD/S program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a SEAL is simply not going to make it so. There is approximately an 80% dropout rate in what is arguably THE roughest military training program - those are the ones who voluntarily drop out, can't compete on a physical level, suffer frequent physical injury during the training or can't handle the psychological harassment. I never got beyond the shallowness of the contrived, purported message of this film. In the real world, Demi wouldn't last the first 24 hours in this harsh and sustained physical training. Wishing alone won't do it. Skip this film as wishful thinking, and better spend your time reading \\\"The Warrior Elite\\\" by Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001)for the best description as to what really goes on in this training. Ring the bell, Demi!  \", \"This is easily the worst Ridley Scott film. Ridley Scott is a wonderful director. But this film is a black mark on his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both totally miscast in an overaggressive film about a girl going to the army. Very stupid. And there is never one scene that is convincing in any way. It is really not difficult to make a film such as this. Everything the crew makes could have been an idea of just anybody. The writers didn't have much inspiration either; many foolish dialogs that made no sense at all; and some brainless action. I strongly recommend to stay away from this rubbish. I hope that the many talented persons involved in this project realize this type of film does not deserve their attention, and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent movies than this useless mess.\", \"This movie is very much like \\\"Flashdance\\\", you know that dance flick with Jennifer Beals. That film is probably the most boring film I have ever seen since it's not even bad enough to be funny. \\\"G.I. Jane\\\" is much better than that film, but that doesn't say much. Here Demi Moore sweats a lot and there's high music and we get to see her fight and everything, but it is certainly not very engaging. I really think the idea behind the film is kind of interesting, but the script is too clich\\u00e9d and Ridley Scott can't do anything about that. Well, like I said... It's better than \\\"Flashdance\\\"... (4/10)\", \"A real disappointment from the great visual master Ridley Scott. G.I. Jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the Navy SEALs. The training is the most difficult and hard in existence as the instructor says in the film to the lead character O'Neil played by Demi Moore. There is no particular message or point in this film or then I couldn't reach it properly. It may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sinks under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the film.  I really can't understand why Ridley uses so much zooms in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert?! It looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so I would really like to know what the director saw in that technique. When I look at his latest film, Black Hawk Dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes (which are plenty) and they are very intense and directed with skill. The whole finale in G.I. Jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killing.  This is Ridley Scott's worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known. Still I'm glad I saw this in Widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and samples of Scott's abilities, but they are very few in this film.  A disappointment and nothing compared to the classics (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien and so on..) of this talented director. So I'm forced to give G.I. Jane 4/10.\", \"Hmmm...where to start? How does a serious actress like Demi Moore got involved in such crap? \\\"First blood\\\" might be rated as bull***t but this type of nonsense is just Rambo with tits, point. Of course if you are interested in the crapstory (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the NAVY Seals) that is the most stupid clich\\u00e9 one I can think of, you'll say \\\"GI Jane\\\" is a great movie. Just the performance from Viggo Mortensen made this movie bearable but hell, I can't think of Demi Moore being Rambo (especially not during the last, useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott doesn't deserve the credits to make this movie one that comes up for women with equal rights, it's just brainless propaganda for the American army and to make it more attractive they dropped Moore in it. Awful movie.\", \"A recent post here by a woman claiming a military background, contained the comment \\\"A woman's life is no more valuable than a man's\\\".  This mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show. Societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population, sometimes with astonishing speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914- 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed. In South America's War of the Triple Alliance (1865), Paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 Chaco War against much larger Bolivia.  No society, however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population. Only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight. Israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered coed combat units for its Defense Forces despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier.  \\\"G.I. Jane\\\" is Hollywood fluff.\", \"  How this film ever got a 6 star average is beyond me. The script is so banal, and frankly an insult to whomevers life it is based upon. The cinematography comes straight from the slick world of advertising, and the talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed. Demi Moore however, shows none a surprise by participating in this film, if one looks at her tracklist. All in all, a \\\"high concept\\\" style film that even Don Simpson would be ashamed of.\", \"I think that movie can`t be a Scott`s film. That is impossible. Do you remember Blade Runner? And Alien? Two greats movies versus a one. I hope didn\\u00b4t see ever it. good bye!!\", \"Naturally I didn't watch 'GI Jane' out of choice. I was more or less forced to watch this film round my ex-girlfriends house.  GI Jane loses its credibility straight away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario, which of course it isn't. The result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by constraints, restricting the amount of humour (of which there is none) or entertaining action scenes, and soon becomes too serious. The film therefore becomes extremely boring and predictable.  'GI Jane' fails where other action films succeed, mainly because films such as James Bond, Dirty Harry and various others are larger than life, yet never proclaim to be otherwise. They are escapism, and therefore entertaining. 'GI Jane' tries to be real and fails.  This is a very disappointing film from Ridley Scott, with a very non-credible storyline, unremarkable acting, and the only reason I give it 2/10 instead of 1/10 is for some of the technical work.\", \"After reading through many of the reviews, I don't know what movie some people were watching, but clearly it wasn't the same one I saw.  This movie is horrible. The acting, primarily Moore's, is just terrible. The woman cannot act. Nice tits, but she just can't act. At no point did she come across as the actual character. Instead, it was spoiled Hollywood actress goes to the beach to play make-believe with the boys.  And that's what this movie ultimately is -- Hollywood make-believe. The training sequences are over the top. The politics -- over the top. The political correctness -- over the top. The combat scenes -- you guessed it, over the top. Your mission is to get in and get out without being detected. So what do you do? Why shoot off as many rounds and make as much noise as possible, of course. Oh G.I. Jane, you can be my wing man anytime.  The premise is good, but as soon as Hollywood gets a hold of it, we end up with Top Gun with tits.  What more is to be expected from commercial US films anymore? Not much I guess.\", \"Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie, but I resisted. I don't know what Ridley Scott intended, but I learned that in the army, women get as stupid as men. They learn to spit, to insult and to fight in combat, and that's also a waste of time (in my opinion). And, anyway, what the hell was that final scene in Lybia? Are they still fighting Gadafi or is it that it's easy for everyone to believe islamic people are always a danger?\", \"I'll be short and to the point. This movie was an insult to any one with a room temperature IQ. Sorry liberals, feminists, etc. No women will ever be a Seal. They can forget about the draft or being in combat too. Ain't going to happen. You see, hard as it is to understand or accept, men and women are physically different.Regardless of the fact it is 2007,reality cannot change things in order for people to avoid having their feelings hurt. Men can't give birth or breast feed babies( Oh-I forgot about San Franfreako ).  Women lack the physical strength to be on par with men in a combat or other physically challenging situations. How many women play in the NFL or NHL? Lastly, I couldn't give a bloody hoot in hell if what I just wrote upsets you.Come to think of it - if this does upset you that only warms my heart more. I didn't write one thing that wasn't the truth. This imbecilic movie is nothing more than a comedy and a lousy one at that.\", \"Demi Moore's character in the movie was selected for the SEALs because of her looks. That was a bad start and the movie went down from there. The plot was totally unbelievable. The will to make it in a tough military unit is not enough. This movie did not convince me of a woman's physical ability to perform the types of tasks required.

I like the pictures, there are characters you can identify it and still: The film is not going anywhere, it's just moving along. It's a series of mini-plots, loosely connected by having the same characters in it. The parts are well made, but the composition is arbitratry in a way that the movie is actually less than the sum of it's parts.  The problem is that the protagonists don't have a goal. They are undecided in what they want to do with their lives, and they never actually make that decision and stick by it. That may or may not be an accurate description of real life in the suburbs, but it certainly makes for bad drama: Somebody without a goal can neither succeed nor fail, she's just going nowhere. Everything will just go round in circles, with slight changes from time to time. So what's the point in watching? Nothing will come out of it anyway.  So ultimately this movie looks like somebody decided that it might be a cool idea to point a camera at two girls and an older guy and see what happens. After the time is up, still nothing has happened. So we just switch off at that point and call it a movie.\", \"Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two close friends who've just graduated from high school, and are trying to decide what to do with their lives. Enid is a dark-haired arch cynic who is tired of living at home with her ineffectual dad (Bob Balaban) and his annoyingly perky girlfriend Maxine (Teri Garr), while Rebecca is prettier and a bit cheerier, but no more certain about her future. While the two girls have vague plans of getting an apartment together, they seem content to while away their summer hanging out and indulging in their shared infatuation with Josh (Brad Renfro), a friend from school who works at a convenience store and doesn't seem to be especially attracted to either of them. Enid discovers that in order to get her diploma, she'll have to take an additional class over the summer, where she winds up studying art with Roberta (Illeana Douglas), who is determined to encourage Enid's creative impulses, whether Enid likes it or not. Enid meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a geeky record collector more than twice her age, and while they would seem to have little in common (and Rebecca thinks he's a creep), Enid discovers a kindred spirit in fellow misfit Seymour, who shares her disgust with the world around them, and a relationship begins to develop between the two. I found Ghost World a very enjoyable movie, but it was sad too. I thought the \\\"mullet man\\\" in the convenience store was hilarious. I thought Steve Buscemi, one of my favorite actors did an outstanding job in this movie as did Birch and Johansson.\", \"Steve Buscemi and Thora Birch...it really doesn't get much better than this, unless Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, and Johnny Depp popped up somehow. Then that would be just overkill. Anyway, this is the best I've seen Buscemi in, and Thora Birch cranks up the angst and cynicism she utilized in American Beauty in her role as Enid. She and Scarlett Johansson remind me of Daria and Jane from the cartoon \\\"Daria.\\\" \\\"Ghost World\\\" is one of those films that proves how much more effective a story can be without all the sugarcoating popular in Hollywood. The open, thought-provoking ending haunted me like that in Donnie Darko. My only qualm is that Enid could be realistically caustic to the point of being unlikable, but she is so REAL! This is what a teen movie SHOULD be...9/10.\", \"Pleasantly surprised as I tuned in on a Monday mid-morning to see something as refreshingly quirky as this film. Thora Birch really played the part very well, and the movie overall had great character development. Fresh and true look into what really happens to some teens as they try to transition from high school life to the reality that is the \\\"real world\\\". Funny and Unique. 4 stars from me.\", \"Here's a movie I wish I'd seen when I was 16: edgy, almost lovable main characters that are weird enough to identify with and an interesting plotline that makes most other \\\"teen\\\" movies bow their heads in shame.  Also, I've read the original comic, that the film is based on, months before seeing the movie, so I was actually surprised how much I liked the movie. Ghost World the Comic (in my humble opinion) is one of the most overrated graphic novels of our times. It was nice, but nothing so special. So when the movie turned out good, I was very pleasantly surprised.  Some elements of the original comics plot were altered for the movie version, which I don't actually mind, because Dan Clowes was one of the screenwriters and was at charge (at least to some extent) in bringing his own comic to the big screen. One of the changes, that I didn't like, was the ending. The ending in the comic was much better, although it might have been difficult to recreate it in a movie (anyone seen a nicely done ageing-makeup in a movie? :D)  \", \"Definitely it is a VERY GOOD movie because it makes you think a lot. I haven't figure out all, yet, but the scene of Seymour, his therapist & his mother tells you more about how similar Seymour and Enid are... she moves to live with Rebbeca and when his life crashes she will go to live with her father...there are many questions yet...and that scene is realy GREAT, it helps you to understand a little bit more about the story...\", \"Ghost World\\\" is an indie treasure.  Rarely do films stick in one's mind a few minutes after seeing them. I have been walking around laughing all day today about scenes in this movie. Other reviews have adequately cataloged the plot, characters and substance of \\\"Ghost World\\\", so I will focus on the beauty of its flavor.  Enid sees the functioning of the adults in her life as the subject of her ironic amusement, and, indeed, the actors brilliantly flesh out the subtle (and not so subtle) humor in their struggles. Every supporting role from the guy who brings his laptop to Starbucks every day to answer the free-coffee trivia questions to the mullet-headed bare-chested convenience store customer with his parking lot numb chuck antics are just hilarious. If ever in life you've looked at a person and wondered for a moment exactly how they got to be who they are, you might see many of their ilk here.  The obvious gem is Steve Buscemi as Seymour, one of my favorite actors. His character reminds me of the Thoreau quote: \\\"the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\\\" He is a man approaching his middle years whose life consists of his dull job, his obese farting roommate, his mother, and his large and obsessive collection of old records that have a room of their own. Not hateful nor whiney about his lot, he simply keeps trying at life, even though his combination of intelligence, appreciation of subtlety and unfortunate odd looks keep him from the mainstream life connections that might fulfill him. Gentle and resigning, he is man who, like many, has come to accept himself and life as things he really can't do anything about. Buscemi manages to play both the fragile patheticness of Seymour and his sweetness, so that we can see why Enid is drawn to him.  This movie (as some of the reviews show) is not for everyone. But, it's definitely one of my new favorites.\", \"i liked this movie, it was something different, something new and i totally loved Thora Birch( one of the coolest actresses around) as the protaganist. The only thing that was lacking was the ending, i found it too symbolic, because it was saying that enids life had not yet begun and her getting on the bus was the start of her life- meh. Besides that i gave the film a seven. Scarlett Johanssen also is pretty cool.\", \"Ghost World is one of the better teen or comming of age movie i have seen in a while. The story was very sweet, and it gives people who are hopeless (like myself) hope. This is because the ugly, but unique dork of the movie gets to find true love! I don't usually see that in todays movies  The movie consists of many interesting characters, and the actors who played the characters did an outstanding job (especially Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi). The settings in the movie was good, and I liked how the movie used different room colors for different occasions in this movie.  There are some problems of this movie: 1. The movie was a little bit long, and sometimes the story drags. 2. Scarlett Johanson character seemed pretty small, it would be nice to more a little bit of Scarlett Johanson character.  This movie was funny, sweet, and interesting. If you are sick of the ordinary teen movies, you should watch this interesting little teen movie called Ghost World :)\", \"Since I'm a huge fan of comic books as well as \\\"cartoony\\\" or comic book based movies, I decided to review this one. When I saw this movie, one or two years ago, I was in my final year of high school, about the same age as the characters in this movie. I too have had a horrible experience in high school. However, I can't say I could relate to the dark world that is portrayed in Ghost World. I have read the comic book after watching the movie. Both of the versions of \\\"Ghost World\\\" portray a world full of sad and annoying people, pedophiles, typical idiotic high school students, and most of all, people faking individuality.   I don't think \\\"Ghost World\\\" is meant to be realistic, but it's meant to portray this world that we live in. Enid and her friend are the main characters who think they are above everyone else, including the depressed guy that is Seymour. However, things don't turn out as they planned. I thought Enid and her friend were very realistic characters. They aren't shown as heroines who are greater than everyone else because of how different they are and how they don't let themselves controlled by society. On the contrary. This is a good point for the movie, since the realism isn't too overwhelming. However, the depressing atmosphere of the movie can be if you aren't into this. As the movie keeps going, it gets more and more depressing and the ending just leaves you with a \\\"bitter taste in your mouth\\\".   It's not that \\\"Ghost World\\\" didn't move me. It did, greatly. But maybe the reason why I didn't like it as much as a lot of people did was because it mainly brought negative feelings to me. I really liked the story as well as the characters, but it was just too hard to stomach. There was very little optimism in the movie. It also seems to be telling the viewers that it's impossible to be an individual in this world, and that you'll always be just another [ insert a subculture or a name here ] to people, which I don't agree with personally.\", \"This is one movie I anticipated above any other. I am a big fan of Thora Birch, and liked Steve Buscemi a lot ever since his brilliant \\\"Trees Lounge\\\". I am also a huge fan of the graphic novel, and all similar comic books. So I waited with baited breath to see this movie. I have to say I wasn't disappointed. All of the edgy black humor and sarcasm of the comic book is translated to the screen, and a lot of care has been taken to recreate the look of the town. Fans of the comic will immediately recognise the images of Daniel Clowes's masterpiece. The darker side of the story, the disillusionment, is all there as well. Thora Birch and Scarlet Johansson play the two girls brilliantly, staying true to the characters of the comic. The cool soundtrack is a big plus too.  This film will move you, and make you laugh and cry. Don't miss it!\", \"**** SPOILERS CONTAINED HEREIN ***  There were a lot of things I liked about this movie: the humour and the characters, but it was basically Thora Birch that carried it - the character of Enid was terrific, reminding me a lot of Daria (who I also like).  The movie itself reminded me of \\\"The Graduate\\\", with the main point being the search by the main character for a direction in life, and the final scene being a bus-ride out of town. The interest was held by wondering what Enid WOULD ACTUALLY DO, as she didn't seem to like any of her options.  It fell down in a number of ways though: I really disliked the 2-dimensional way in which the character of Enid's father was treated - it seemed like a really cynical way of ruling out the \\\"family\\\" option. The ending was a complete cop-out - her simply skipping town on a bus is NOT A CHOICE. Even the people who like the movie don't like the ending, and have come up with various \\\"mystical\\\" or suicidal interpretations to excuse it.  The main problem is that there is a PERFECTLY OBVIOUS solution to Enid's \\\"problems\\\", which is that she should GO TO COLLEGE. She would have another few years to grow up and develop proper social skills. This is what college is for. At least in \\\"The Graduate\\\" Dustin Hoffman was a COLLEGE graduate, so his struggles were more grounded in adult sensitivities.  Anyway, I think I'm making this sound worse than it was. I did really like it for the most part, but felt that it lost it's way a little, and ended badly. 7/10.\", \"Now that I know the film is based on a comic book, it figures. As I watched it without knowing that, I was reminded of MTV's Daria, especially in the way the main character, Enid, reacts to mostly everything and everyone with a mix of sarcasm and apathy. Thora Birch plays yet another teenage misfit, it's hard to tell if she's so good at it or if you're just used to seeing her in that role. There are times when the clich\\u00e9s and caricatures can become a bit too heavy, but overall it works.  Everything in the film has a sketch-like quality, from the photography and setting to the plot itself, which is more like a series of vignettes. Sketches are also how Enid describes the reality around her, by drawing on her diary. There's a theme of fakeness running through the film and several brief comedy scenes serve to illustrate that - like when Enid and her friend are sitting in a fifties \\\"authentic\\\" diner and 80's music comes through the juke box. It's one of the signs of the uninspiring, suspended surreality they live in.   Enid's friend, Rebecca, played by Scarlet Johansson, is a marginal character, she doesn't get much of a role in the film, other than to serve as contrast for Enid. She ends up adapting more easily, gets a job and a flat, and their relationship grows colder as Enid has more and more difficulty following her friend's example, or even deciding if she wants to follow that route at all. There's a scene where Rebecca, frustrated by Enid's inability to make up her mind, blurts out rather cruelly \\\"good luck living with your father for the rest of your life\\\". That remark, along with the situation it refers to, is one of the things that lead Enid to realize she needs to take some decisions or they'll all be taken for her by others. That is what the whole film basically revolves around.   There are funny bits of social satire, like the misguided controversy over Enid's art piece and the failure of her teacher to stand up for her. For Enid, even good experiences start from unpromising circumstances and her own most careless indifference. The idea of life as a matter of success vs. failure, winners vs. losers is debunked.   Steve Buscemi is, as ever, absolutely brilliant as the \\\"dork\\\" Seymour. His character is also in many ways a caricature, but he gives it real depth. The unlikely affair developing between him and Enid is the most genuine part of the film. What happens to Seymour in the end is dealt with a heavier dose of comedy than perhaps would have been necessary, while Enid's future is more poetically left open-ended. For anyone expecting some sort of definite closure, this is going to be disappointing, but I don't think it is one of the flaws of the film. It just doesn't have a typical plot development so there is no contradiction in the ending being so vague. The final scene makes nice use of a tiny sub-plot that was both comical and loaded with heavier symbolism, the old man sitting on a bench waiting for a bus that never seems to come. When Enid finally catches her own bus we don't know where it leads and what she plans to do or with what money, but, as someone who really cannot stand cheesy happy endings, I thought this was a nice way of closing the film. She finally gets the courage to enact her wish about leaving in exactly the way she had talked of before. It does work as a resolution in an understated way, showing us how, after waiting for something to happen from outside, she finally decided it was up to her to start taking control of her life.   All in all, an enjoyable, lighthearted and bittersweet satirical comedy, with good acting (did I mention Buscemi is fabulous?) and amusing dialogues and situations. Just don't expect too much out of it, and you'll be pleasantly surprised. 7/10\", \"This is a very funny and sad movie about two girls (Enid and Rebecca) just entering the real world trying to figure out what to do with life, just as Seymour, a middle aged man, struggles through his own life as he has trouble relating to other people. While Enid and Rebecca discover that life outside of high school isn't as great as they imagined it to be, Seymour (who already knows about the loneliness of life) tries for once in his life to actually start living instead of just floating through life. Steve Buscemi, who plays Seymour, has one of his most memorable performances, and Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson are perfect fits for their roles. Anyone who feels like they don't quite fit in with society will surely find something to like in this movie. There has never been a teen movie like this, and there probably isn't any that are better than this. And don't forget about the old man waiting for the bus. Could this old man have the answer?\", \"The end of high school can be a polarizing experience. On the one hand, its the start of a whole new and exciting life. But on the other, its a terrifying prospect. Its the first time in a young person's life when they can get out into the real world and see what lies in wait for them. Either exciting surprises or grave disappointments.  Ghost World, my choice for best teen film of 2001, neatly captures the mindset of anguished teenagers at this particular crossroads in life. Its not always accessible, but in this day and age of cookie cutter teen fodder, that's something of a relief.  The two teens Ghost World chooses to observe are Enid and Rebecca, both wonderfully played by Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson. The opening scene witnesses their high school graduation. Something Enid & Rebecca greet with almost casual indifference. Their lives are undeniably changing, they just haven't decided if its for better or worse.  Ghost World is a film that seems to occupy a bizarre buffer zone between two netherworlds. Its a skewed vision of suburbia, not unlike something out of a Tim Burton or a John Waters film. And director Terry Zwigoff paints a quite appealing portrait of an oddball utopia slowly being swallowed up by \\\"progress\\\" such as mini-marts and consumerism.  Enid & Rebecca are casual observers. Anything that falls below their radar, you can bet Enid will have some witty rejoinder or dry comment dripping in sarcasm on hand, while Rebecca stands off to the side mulling it over and chipping in if and when necessary.  The film charts the deterioration of their friendship. Although Enid is in no hurry to grow up and get on with things, Rebecca senses an inevitability to her life. Being a non-conformist is one thing, but at some point, we all have to conform to some of life's expectations of us.  Rebecca gets a job at Starbucks (or something like it) and goes apartment hunting for herself and Enid. Things like these don't interest Enid. She's trapped in a perpetual fantasy. A bubble she believes will remain intact. And when she does try to follow Rebecca's example, doing a regular job, its like watching a dog walk on its hind legs.  Enid wasn't meant for normal life. She loves to stand out from everyone around her. And she has an eclectic wardrobe for each and every (social) occasion. Rebecca may be an outsider too, but perhaps she recognises it as one of life's many phases.  So with Enid & Rebecca growing further and further apart, Enid finds solace in Seymour (a perfectly cast Steve Buscemi), a record collector unlucky in love. Enid plays a rather cruel joke on Seymour by responding to a personal ad he put in the paper. She stands him up, sort of, by observing him from a distance (like she does with everything), and becomes fascinated by this oddity of a man.  She senses a kindred spirit in Seymour. Someone who doesn't fit in, a social misfit, and inept at life's ironies. But when she actually gets Seymour a date, he starts spending less and less time with Enid. And as Enid's perfectly perceptive world falls apart, she spirals into depression and despair.  Ghost World is the type of teen film you pray for, and when it finally comes, you almost feel like slapping yourself in astonishment. A teen film that's witty, sharp but most of all, perceptive. Also one of its nicest touches is the fact it stars actual teenagers for a change, not adults ten years older.  Ghost World comes with a positively anti-authoritarian stamp on it. I sense Terry Zwigoff is a bit of a non-conformist himself. And he's selected two superb actresses to carry the film off with aplomb.  Thora Birch is the undisputed star. She so neatly captures Enid's character you couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. Her performance is so wonderful the way it rotates from cynicism, intuition and eventually gut-wrenching despair. Each line of dialogue she delivers to perfection. From capital letter to full stop. And yet despite being attuned to the world around her, she is naive in her way. She has the vain belief things will always stay the same. Observing the world at a coldly detached distance. But as the world makes her a participant, its something that shatters her world forever. What an impressive, heartbreaking performance from someone so young.  Ghost World came at a time just before Scarlett Johansson's career took off. And although she doesn't get as much screen time as Birch, she's equally impressive. She quite modestly allows Birch to take the spotlight because she knows its Enid's life story that's captured our interest. Johansson's performance is more subtle than Birch's, but she is necessary, because she provides an effective counterpoint to Enid's role without having to do very much at all. Which is why Scarlett Johansson is such a wonderful actress. But she'd have to wait for Lost in Translation to show her true mettle, where she plays a character not all that different from Rebecca.  Steve Buscemi is in his element as Seymour. He's the man we hope to never become. Buscemi is known for choosing quirky, off-centre roles and Seymour is no exception. A man of few joys and even fewer accomplishments.  The crux of Ghost World is Enid. What she slowly senses is that her defiantly defended role as life's abject observer can't go on forever. One day, she will have to grow up. And perhaps she does at the end. The last thing we ever see of her is getting on a bus. Where she's going is a mystery. But at least she's getting out of town. Perhaps progress has finally caught up with Enid.  Cherish Ghost World. Its the perfect antidote to predictable teen movies and their comfortable clich\\u00e9s.\", \"Enid (Thora Birch) says to her father, as he tells her where she could apply for a job. The film encompasses surrealism, depression, teen angst and people who feel disenfranchised. Basically, everyone.  As one reviewer mentioned, it is not a formulaic Disney movie, nor is it a Gothic depressive movie, like \\\"Disturbing Behavior\\\" or other teen movies. This film actually stands out on its own, and the performances are excellent. Steve Buscemi is believable and sympathetic as the local loser who Enid and her friend decide to stalk. Ileana Douglas portrays Enid's art teacher (classically quirky). Enid is required to take art class for the summer \\\"for retard losers\\\" she tells Teri Garr, her father's girlfriend.  Enid and her friend find the world out of school has little more to offer- The hypocrisy of graduation; when the class president speaks: \\\"I liked her so much better when she was a crack head\\\" Johannson sneers. Classic.  Enid also reflects that she will miss the geeky classmate who she will never see again- a familiar sense that \\\"what is to come\\\" may also be a disappointment. The underlying theme of Seymour's (Buscemi's) collection of 78's, and a lost world, is touching and effective. He works as a VP at what was formerly known as \\\"Coon Chicken\\\". Enid develops an interest in this, and brings the logo to her art class,where Douglas commends her for her awareness of the subject. Yes, there were places like that, Seymour says, now it is less out in the open. The possibility that we all live in a ghost world of our own is not just a remote possibility.  This film is excellent for its creative portrayal of disenfranchisement, discontent, and the humor that saves us from despair. Johansson offers comic relief when Enid visits her at the local coffee house where she works: ...\\\"mostly I just want to kill everyone\\\"... The starkness and impersonal environment of the strip malls, the Sidewinder where Brad Renfro makes slushies, the \\\"fake 50's diner\\\" where weird Al works- all these places are familiar americana. Hopefully John Malkovich will make a sequel. 10/10\", \"I was surprised to find that Ghost World is a comic book adaptation. The film is full of quirkiness and a same-time embracing of geeks/dorks as well as pitying them. We start with two semi-outcast high school students graduating high school. From then, we primarily follow Enid (Thora Birch), who finds herself in an existential phase of her life, having escaped from her hated experience, but finding herself in a meaningless and pointless world, with little direction of her own. And this is a comedy that somehow works, even when burdened by such philosophical weight.  The comedy in Ghost World is not the gut-busting type, but rather the quiet situational type that's amusing. At the same time, as we laugh at the nerds, geek, freaks, dorks and dweebs that inhabit Ghost World, the film works to humanize them in our eyes and raise a sympathy for them. Suddenly their eccentricities seem less strange and more interesting. And like Enid, we find ourselves drawn to them.  This film has a bit in common in terms of tone with the heavier American Splendor as well as the lighter Napoleon Dynamite, featuring an offbeat humor style and complete with curious characters. Despite the comedy, this film is a drama at its core, dealing with a youth's entry to the \\\"real world\\\", complete with all its harshness and disappointments. As we watch the film, we see her best-friendship with Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) tested, struggle with young love and infatuation and try to find her way in a world that doesn't feed her direction, but asks her to discover it for herself. And like many young people, she finds it very difficult to deal with the responsibility.  And in the drama, we find the heart of the film, watching Enid with compassionate eyes through her struggles.  Steve Buscimi completes the primary cast as Seymour, a jazz/blues geek who Enid takes on as her first mission once she graduates, finding in him a sort of spiritual corollary. The performances are solid, with the humor played deadpan and the drama dramatic. The direction is of the classic invisible Hollywood style and the pace of the film is fine. I think the ending is a little bit of a cop-out, but I guess that's how some stories go.  I thought it was a good, quirky little film and if you're a fan of those kinds of films, I'd recommend Ghost World to you. 8/10\", \"Wow is the only thing I can say about this movie. There never was and will never be anything like it. It is the only movie that I watched more than 20 times, sometimes twice in a row. It is the best movie on the planet! I think that Thora Birch is the only one who could play Enid because nobody else would be that convincing. Every single time I watch this movie I discover something new and that is why I keep watching it. If there are original movies left in this world, then one of them should definitely be Ghost World. Now, I could keep talking about this for hours and still I would have to say more. The best way to find out what I'm talking about is to watch it.\", \"This is the story of Enid (Tora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) after they finish the high school. Both have problems to be related with people and they spend their time hanging around and bothering creeps. When they met Seymour (Steve Buscemi) who is a social outsider who loves to collect old vinyl records, the life of Enid will change forever.  The screenplay of this memorable film was based on a comic book with the same name, created by Daniel Clowes. The plot is very simple but excellent and there are a lot of memorable dialogs and two memorable characters that makes this film as one of the most original films ever and that is, without a doubt, Terry Zwigoff's masterpiece. The way that the film start, when we can see how Enid and Rebecca spend their time, is really strange in consequence of the strange attitude of the characters . I mean when they follow the \\\"satanic\\\" couple is really bizarre but later they just forget about them in less than a minute and they stop in a restaurant, and it's even more bizarre. And there are lots of this kind of scenes that makes this characters truly memorable and the best thing is that they are believable. And the other main character, Seymour, is also great. The lines of all the characters are really great and the critic to the ignorant society too, specially the scene when a man is looking for the film \\\"8 1/2\\\" by Fellini and the video clerk give him the film \\\"Nine 1/2 Weeks\\\" with Mickey Rourke.  Well, the cast is perfect; Tora Birch is amazing in the best character of the film, Scarlett Johansson is perfect in all the ways and Steve Buscemi is excellent like always in a memorable character. The rest of the cast is excellent too like the rest of the secondary characters like Josh (Brad Renfro) or Roberta Allsworth (Illeana Douglas). And the music is another perfect thing of this film just like in every other masterpiece like this one.  Conclusion: i really love this film that is highly re-watchable and for me is one the best films of the 00's and amazingly original. I haven't read the comic book but Daniel Clowes, the creator, write the film too so i think is very similar to the comic book, that i'm going to get soon. So watch this film, is funny thanks to the great satire to the society but also is sad thanks to one character who doesn't know what to do with her life and is quite disappointed with the rest of the world. A ghost world. 10 out of 10\", \"Enid and Rebecca are two cynical teenagers who live in a world in which everything seems phony and contrived. Everyone belongs to a clique or a group, and all these groups are seen to be hollow and devoid of any worthwhile substance.  The film is broken down into three acts. The first act consists of Enid and Rebecca observing and critiquing the world around them. The world is devoid of value and people lack sophistication, filling their times with banal activities and pointless gestures. Time and again, characters are shown to lack depth. They have no appreciation of quality or craftsmanship and simply have no desire to learn or understand.  Enid and Rebecca, of course, are not like this. They're two artists, constantly observing and chartering what goes on around them. This acute perception makes them sick. They can't relate to 99 percent of the people around them. If life is so sick and everyone so annoying, how can these girls properly function in the world? If ignorance is bliss, how can these two enlightened teens exist in a world so unenlightened and stupid?   Plato called art and philosophy the highest occupations precisely because they are profoundly useless. In understanding and observing his world, man is able to transcend the basic routines of his animal life. The downside is, the more you understand things, the less you identify with the herd. The less you identify with others, the more horrible you feel (see Antonioni).  After college, Enid and Rebecca are thus faced with an important question. What next? How do I function and where do I go? Rebecca's answer is to throw away her artistic sensibilities and adopt a more practical view of life. She decides to get a practical job, buy a little apartment and become just another faceless peon to society. She just wants to be normal. This is paradoxically seen as both a step forward into adulthood and a regressive step back into childishness. Yes Rebecca steps forward and assumes adult responsibilities, but her responsibilities are based on a child's view of what an adult should be. In one great shot, Rebecca stands before an ironing board, her transformation into womanhood complete. She's so wrapped up in actually getting on with life, that she hasn't the time or inclination to stop and ponder the banal monster she's become.  Enid, in contrast, can't accept this blissful ignorance. She needs to find substance. Somewhere. Anywhere. The answer, of course, seems to be in enrolling in an art college. Isn't this where all observational, overly sensitive outcasts go? But no, even this art class seems pretentious and hypocritical. Everything is a stupid facade. Where can she just be herself?   The second act of the film deals with Enid falling in love with Seymore, brilliantly played by Steve Buscemi. He's a middle aged man who lives in the past, collecting old records and antiques. \\\"You think this is healthy,\\\" he says, \\\"I can't connect with people so I fill my life with this stuff.\\\" The irony is that everyone collects and does routine stuff. Seymore and Enid just have an awareness of why it's done. They're outside the box, looking inwards.  Like \\\"Fight Club\\\" the film is completely angry at pop culture. The radio annoys Seymore, with it's constant advertising and pompous DJs. \\\"I feel like I'm being jabbed in the face,\\\" he says. Earlier in the film, a customer moans at a video store clerk for not stocking Fellini's 8 \\u00bd (yet the store has the Kim Basinger sex film 9 \\u00bd weeks). Abstract this further and you have the angry assault of \\\"Clockwork Orange's\\\" post modern furniture, music and art.  There's some subtle symbolism in the film. Enid constantly tries to latch on to past fashion trends and musical genres as she tries to create an identity for herself. An outdated pair of Levis always seems to be strewn on the sidewalk. There are two garage sales, but the same record is sold in each case. It's also interesting that Enid and Rebecca are only sexually attracted to specific types of boys. At the start of the film, Enid sympathises with a guy called Dennis and both girls are attracted to another kid called Josh. Why? Because both these guys have that genuine rarity of being exactly what they appear to be. No pretence. No attempts to be cool. Even though Dennis is a dweeb, he isn't trying to be anything else. And Josh, basically a dishevelled kid, seems open and honest. The girls feel a connection because these kids represent some form of truth.  The last act of the film deals with Enid trying to set Seymore up on a date. Symbolically, she understands that if she can get an outcast like Seymore to function in society, then maybe there is hope for her too. Unfortunately, Seymore's relationship with his date falls apart. Enid, feeling hopeless, thus hops on board a bus. She hopes to leave town. She hopes to travel the world and maybe find herself. Find something she can latch on to. One can view this ending with optimism, but it's also naive to assume that Enid's internal \\\"problem\\\" can be solved by changing her external surroundings.   The film thus ends on very much the same note as George Lucas' \\\"American Graffeti\\\", with the artist flying away, a sense of sad possibility lingering in the air.   8.5/10- Terry Zwigoff has made 3 pretty great films. \\\"Bad Santa\\\", \\\"Ghost World\\\" and \\\"Crumb\\\". This film makes a nice companion piece to \\\"400 Blows\\\", \\\"American Graffiti\\\", \\\"Ratatouille\\\", \\\"Harold and Maude\\\" and \\\"Fight Club\\\". I guess you can also equate it with Antonioni's work, though his films deal less with the artist, and more with the disillusionment that comes with perception. It's interesting that aside from Pixar's and Hal Ashby's film, all films that deal with artists in this way end on a depressing note.\", \"Ghost World (2001), by cult director Terry Zwigoff (Bad Santa (2003)) is aimed at the intelligent, open minded and cultured teenagers who are aware of what is ahead of them, yet choose to enjoy the life of a child and not wanting to grow up. Keeping in mind it is a film, it could be enjoyed by anyone.  Amazing to see a teenaged-based film that doesn't revolve around titties, toilet humor, beer and drugs but more so revolves around culture and intelligence and pushes the fact that not all teenagers are useless. In fact there are many teenagers out there who are rather intelligent, mature and wise beyond their years yet still like their basic humour associated with other peoples demise, which in this film, is done amazingly well and it is quite relatable when we see Enid and Rebecca laughing at the \\\"satanists\\\" in the diner. My friends and I usually laugh at that typical fat, dirty old man in the city who hits on young girls or those freaky-looking folks who have no sense of fashion, which, as mean as it is, is just a little fun, which is exactly what these girls do and this relates to modern teenagers.  What Ghost World also holds is mountains and mountains of culture all dating way back to the 1960's Bollywood films and the 1970's underground music which is so satisfying to see now as so many people my age don't comprehend or care for, they prefer trash that MTV spits in our faces and know we'll love it and buy but the thing is, because the majority is rather culturally inept and likes anything dating from 2001 to modern times, leaves the other types left out, where do they go? They must dig and dig under all this modern pop culture to find the real hip stuff, the real cool stuff that our mothers and fathers listened to and watched when they were kids, and Ghost World is satisfying because its so up to date with the minority and yet references so many musicians, artists and films and its striking out to those MTV kids and others, the MTV kids who don't know who Pink Floyd is, or the ones who've never heard of the film Midnight Express or 8\\u00bd which is even mentioned in this film. It's a relief and leaves a smile on such non-conformist types, the ones who aren't \\\"emo\\\" or \\\"gangsta\\\" or this or that. It could be for everyone of course, but this film is clearly aimed at particular audiences.  Now, on with the actual film itself. I would say apart from the great style and culture of the movie, its still great; acting, characters, story, ending, everything. The whole movie is brilliance in a bottle. Enid and Rebecca, best friends, alternative hip kids, have just graduated school rolling their eyes over their fellow pop loving peers but Enid doesn't want to grow up, she doesn't want to change herself for a bunch of customers at a job, she doesn't want to move out of home. She wants to be in a kid forever, which so many kids our age can relate to. Many of us don't want to grow up. Where Rebecca is mature and all, she's waiting for Enid to move into an apartment with her and get a job but Enid is far too busy with her nerdy record collecting friend Seymour who she previously stood up for as a joke. As time goes on Enid spends more and more of her spare time with Seymour, and ends up losing her school certificate because she didn't turn up to the art show and everything for her falls apart. \\\"Ever wanted to just disappear and no one would ever ask what happened to you\\\" Enid said to Rebecca. \\\"No.\\\" She replies.  As we saw previously in the film, an old senile man waits at the bus stop for a bus that doesn't come by anymore. Enid says to him at some stage \\\"ever since my life fell apart you're the only one I can rely on because I know you'll always be here\\\" or something along those lines, where as, this somewhat explains that Enid's entire world is changing, except this one lonesome man at the bus stop but once he says he is leaving this means her entire life is changing. He catches the bus symbolizing everything has changed for Enid. Even in the end, Enid has caught that same bus which represents after all the things Enid has put herself through she is finally accepting to grow up and start her life. A great, relatable and cultured film, with for me ranks grade A marks in my book. This film is beyond recommendation; this film should be seen by everyone, whether you like it or not, you can't just be ignorant, you have to look into this film and analysis it.\", \"\\\"We graduated from high school. How totally amazing\\\", says a sarcastic Enid Coleslaw (Thora Birch, in the best performance of her career), at the beginning of \\\"Ghost World\\\". Enid and her best friend, Rebecca (a 15 year-old Scarlett Johansson) discuss how much they longed for their graduation day, and when it finally came, it wasn't as cheerful as they were expecting. While Rebecca finds a job and tries to move on, Enid doesn't know what to do with her life and spends most of her time with Seymour (Steve Buscemi, playing the most humane variation of all the 'losers' he's been playing his whole life, and that's why he's so great at it), a lonely older man whose biggest pleasure is collecting rare, old records.  The more I watch \\\"Ghost World\\\", the more I like it. This is a very special, really beautiful film, that speaks to the heart. It's both hilarious (really one of the funniest films I've ever seen - Enid's yard sale, her first day of work at a movie theater, just to name a couple of favourite scenes, crack me up every time) and moving, with a bittersweet feel to it that's underlined by David Kitay's musical theme. Terry Zwigoff's (\\\"Crumb\\\") script, co-written by Daniel Clowes based on his own comic books, has a remarkable respect for its characters, most of them adorable and pathetic at once - including Josh (Brad Renfro), a boy Enid and Rebecca love to mess around with. One week ago, when I was re-watching this movie with some friends who had never seen it, we commented on how miserable Josh is - and how sad it was to hear about Renfro's premature death a few days later.  If you ever felt lost in your own world, not knowing what do with your life, you're gonna relate to this film. The feeling I get from it is a little similar to THAT other film with Scarlett Johansson, the sublime \\\"Lost in Translation\\\". For me, any movie as sincere and well crafted as \\\"Ghost World\\\" and \\\"Lost in Translation\\\" is a classic, and deserves a spot on my all-time favourites' list. 10/10.\", \"The first time I saw this movie I f***ing went insane! Best movie I had ever seen! I saw it on the first day of school that year, so it started me off pumped. It meant so much to me, and accentuated and made sense of many parts of my life. I cannot explain how close I am to this movie. My best fiend saw it with me too, and we have been a lot closer since then.  It was very smartly written, realistic as hell- not necessarily the actions, but the feelings behind the actions taken in this movie.  It is basically about this girl named Enid (Thora Birch) who has just graduated high school, and doesn't know where her life is going. She quickly discriminates against others, though I think that most of the time, she is justified. Enid and her friend Rebecca are spending the whole movie thinking about getting an apartment, but Enid procrastinates. She basically stops caring about anything that will help her in life, and entertains herself by hating everything that she can. This makes her depressed, and she loves it. Enid becomes involved with an older jazz/ragtime enthusiast named Seymour (Steve Buscemi) who has issues relating to others. Enid likes/ is intrigued by him, and feels that he can relate to her better than anyone else that she knows in her world. Seymour is her drug. As a drama, Ghost World was great. The first half of the movie, though, was one of the funniest, darkest setups I have ever seen. A lot of sarcastic humor that many would call ______ist, but whatever. It's got some of the best one liners I've ever heard. I will not go on and on about the ending, because other reviewers have overly voiced their 10 line opinions about how it's so good that it's gone past bad and back to good again or really \\\"sucky and artsy\\\". About the ending, I will say this- It is not a normal Hollywood ending. That's good. Hollywood is redundant.  \\\"A tampon in a teacup?\\\"  \\\"It's my response to a women's right to choose. It's something I feel super strongly about!\\\"\", \"I love this movie. It is so simple. Just an episode from the lives of two girls who have just finished high school. Nothing fancy, nothing spectacular, or unusual. Just a situation that we've all been through, but shown through a different set of eyes.  The performances by Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson (hottie), and Steve Buscemi are very good and the story is heart warming and often very funny.  Movies like this are seldom and Hollywood tends to make it's films unnecessarily spectacular these days. It sometimes works, but is often quite ridiculous. Think - Michael Bay.  This is film is highly recommended to anyone who cares about life. 10/10  Rated R: profanity\", \"Two female high school grads plan to get jobs and hang together, but bonds become frayed and paths separate after one of the girls ends up on an unintended journey of self-discovery. From the comic-book which takes a perverse delight in celebrating the geeky side of all of us, \\\"Ghost World\\\" is profane and cynical, but also surprisingly blithe and bright. I rather enjoyed it but realize it's not for every taste. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson are incredibly rich and vivid in their roles (low-keyed, deadpan, but not blanks); their love-hate friendship is convincing and blessedly free of melodramatics--even they seem to cherish the personality conflicts that come up, it may give them more ammunition. As for the ending, I'm not sure if it's ingenious or a cop-out, but it did leave me touched (in a bemused, nostalgic way). It's a movie with much to offer. ***1/2 from ****\", \"Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are best friends having difficulties in social attitude with other people. After graduating in high-school, they decide to get a job and rent a house of their own. However, Enid need to attend the Arts summer school to graduate and the unsociable behavior of Enid makes her lose her job. Meanwhile, they play a prank with Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a middle-age collector of long-plays record that feels also difficulties of relationship, and Seymour and Enid become friends. Along the days, Enid reaches maturity and a different view of life.  \\\"Ghost World\\\" is an excellent low-budget cult-movie nominated for Oscar in the category of Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published and awarded in another twenty-five (25) prizes plus twenty-four (24) nominations in different festivals. The caustic and mature adolescent-coming-to-age story is centered in the weird and rebel Enid facing and overcoming the need to join the real world after the high-school period, and is brilliantly directed by Terry Zwigoff, who also writes the wonderful screenplay with Daniel Clowes. The performance of Thora Birch, probably in her best role, also deserved a nomination to the Oscar. Scarlett Johansson, Steve Buscemi and the supporting cast are also awesome. I really loved \\\"Ghost World\\\" a lot, and I would like to thank my great movie-lover friend Ricardo that recommended this gem. My vote is nine.  Title (Brazil): \\\"Ghost World \\u0096 Aprendendo a Viver\\\" / a.k.a. \\\"Mundo C\\u00e3o\\\" (\\\"Ghost World \\u0096 Leaning to Live\\\" / \\\"Dog's World\\\")\", \"GHOST WORLD / (2001) **** (out of four)  For those of us who tire of standard teen movies, here's the film to brighten our day. It's a monkey wrench in the cranks of the tedious genre that features actors in their mid-twenties portraying stereotypical high-school characters shamelessly indulging predictable plots of frivolous romance. Where most movies set in high schools find resolve in romantics, \\\"Ghost World\\\" dares to be different.  Yet it contains all the usual ingredients-aimless main characters, one-dimensional side characters, high school graduation, moronic parents, sexual revelations, a romance-but it tastes different. This movie doesn't believe high school is the root of youth complications; it knows that school isn't where the confusion lies-it's after graduation when the complexities begin.  The movie opens as a high school senior dances along with a music video. Sounds like a typical teenager? Well, not really. The music this girl listens to isn't exactly mainstream. Nothing about Enid (Thora Birch from \\\"American Beauty\\\") is ordinary.  The same goes for her best friend, Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson). She is slightly more focused than the aimless Enid, but, as they graduate from high school in the opening scenes, neither of them know what they want out of life.  Rebecca and Enid find interesting people to follow, exploit, and embarrass, just for their own leisure, but even this loses its edge. Making the most (or least) of their situation, the girls stumble upon an outstandingly pathetic personal ad. As a joke, they respond. However, when they meet this man, Enid becomes infatuated with him.  In their post high school days, Enid and Rebecca find themselves slowly drifting apart. Rebecca is eager to get an apartment and get on with her life, while Enid lives by the day, following one infatuation after another. As their attitudes gradually change from cynical to sober, Enid and Rebecca's emerging differences become blatantly obvious, but painfully realized.  \\\"Ghost World\\\" refers to the world in which these characters live, a town slowly being overcome by shopping malls and coffee shops; a town that slowly loses its distinctions and becomes a ghost of what it once was.  My small town of Mason, MI speaks for itself. Once a minuscule farming suburb of the state's capital, it's now a breeding ground for new subdivisions, factories, stores, gas stations, trailer parks, and businesses. Before you know it, it will be a densely populated city like the capital itself.  \\\"Ghost World\\\" makes harsh points, but it never loses its sense of humor. Enid is so full of bitter cynicism that we have to laugh. She indulges the dialogue. It's often tactlessly frank, savoring every opportunity to bash, thrash, ridicule, or insult anyone or anything for any reason.  Society tends to repress our caustic desire to insult a fellow man, but \\\"Ghost World\\\" doesn't hesitate. It takes a lot of risks, but never steps in the wrong direction. It connects us with these characters. They are so casually antisocial that we can't help but to love them. At times, the movie doesn't require dialogue. It simply examines the character's surroundings. We get to know these people so well, we know exactly what they're thinking before they say it. They are a part of our instincts to react on impulse.  But a character is only as good as the actor behind it. \\\"Ghost World\\\" features enormously engaging performances. Brad Renfro gives his nobody store clerk a raw blandness. Illeana Douglas injects a kind of controlled eccentricity into her role as an art teacher. Steve Buscemi creates a hopeless record player collector out of repressed emotion, and lack thereof.  Scarlett Johansson gives Rebecca a dry, depressed mood. Thora Birch steals the whole show with a straightforward, fearless performance. Although the movie never defines the relationship between Enid and Rebecca, the actors themselves make it clear. They create an enticing charisma that gradually turns to an awkward tension.  \\\"Ghost World\\\" captures part of our journey from childhood to adulthood with poetic grace and cynical wit. Though it's not really a coming-of-age film, where a young character finally takes a place in the world. Enid never finds her place, decides her future, or chooses a path. By the end of the story, she simply becomes aware of her possible options. This movie is just the beginning of her story.\", \"Best friends Enid and Rebecca graduate from high school and find themselves forced to enter the real world. Enid (more than Rebecca) is a counter-culture rebel who hates this world of frauds and losers, and she subsequently has trouble getting and keeping a job. One day the girls decide to play a prank on a lonely middle-aged loser named Seymour. Their plan backfires, though, and Enid becomes a little obsessed with the man. First she feels sorry for Seymour, then he becomes something of a hero to her, and she resolves to help him at least find a girlfriend. \\\"Maybe I just can't stand the thought of a world where a guy like you can't get a date,\\\" she tells him. Meanwhile, Enid seems to be avoiding the challenge of getting her own life started.  Terry Zwigoff (\\\"Crumb\\\") directs this film based on a script by Dan Clowes, who also created the original comic book. \\\"Ghost World\\\" attempts to be a kitsch-free, counter-culture coming-of-age film, and for the most part it succeeds. The characters are very believable, honest, and engaging. The downbeat Seymour is played wonderfully by Steve Buscemi, and Thora Birch in her striking performance as Enid follows up her \\\"American Beauty\\\" role with another discontent but sympathetic misfit teen character. Perhaps the greatest disappointment in \\\"Ghost World,\\\" however, is that Scarlett Johansson as Rebecca is marginalized midway through the film. Regarding the story: It is debatable whether the film is entirely free of kitsch. As with \\\"American Beauty,\\\" the sudden romantic opportunities which fall into Seymour's lap smell suspiciously of middle-aged wish fulfillment. Also, one might ask for a slightly tighter ending, as the film finishes without much resolution--except for one rather simple but touching scene between Enid and Seymour. On the whole, however, the film is a delight, producing some very memorable characters to whom, in the end, the audience will be sorry to say goodbye.\", \"I guess different people can extract different meanings from GHOST WORLD and all nail exactly why it was made. For me, it was the chronicle of that small group of people who don't, and probably never will, quite fit into this world. They're here on the fringes though, just existing in their own parallel universe, or their own \\\"ghost world.\\\" Though it sounds depressing, this film is hardly a downer, it's full of humor, satire and acute observations on life. The overall production is excellent (the brightness and colors in the photography, costumes and sets is stunning)... plus it pulls off the impossible by successfully steering toward dead-on seriousness near the conclusion to drive it's point across.  It begins at graduation with Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson), two very perceptive high school outcasts who see right through the facade of their juvenile peers and want nothing to do with it. For Rebecca this self-ostracizing is just a passing phasing, but for Enid you get the strong impression this is going to always be her way of life. It's not that she doesn't get it, it's that she's doesn't understand IT or people or the games of life. There's a brief emotional turning point for Enid when a cruel practical joke backfires and she becomes involved with the target, the nerdy and very sardonic Seymour (Steve Buscemi), who may just be the kindred spirit Enid was looking for. The shared scenes between Enid and Seymour, though doomed to take a bad turn, are handled with tenderness by the director and actors and are quite memorable and touching.  Highlights are an excellent scene in a blues club that just about nails the American outlook on life and our lack of reverence and the ones in Enid's remedial art class, with the most misguided and pretentious teacher (Illeana Douglas) you could imagine. The girls are wonderful, and Steve Buscemi was unfairly overlooked at awards time (big shocker). Anyway, he's never been this good before. The fact this premise, these ideas and these original and interesting characters came from a comic book makes me realize I've completely overlooked the artistic possibilities within that medium.\", \"Movies that criticise the world can fall into many traps, leaving the viewer to feel jaded by the film's experience. Ghost World's witty appraisal of 'America' successfully avoids being childishly caustic or self-important and thus emerges as one of the best films of 2001. We sympathise with Enid (the luscious Thora Birch) without being expected to completely believe that her cynical world-view is necessarily the right one. Enid's (and her best-friend Rebecca's)negativity is turned on all around them, and their obsessive need to be cool but on their own terms sees them take post-modernism to its absurd conclusion.   Enid's bizarre costume choices mean that she stands out from the rest of her baggy-panted generation, and in one scene is infuriated that no-one, even Rebecca, understands her 'original 1977 punk look' she's testing out.  The fact that we should not fully empathise with Enid is shown by the contrasting character arc of Rebecca. There is a definite sense that she grows up over the course of the movie, but not in a \\\"what have we learned about life\\\" Disney way. Perhaps she has sold out to the conservative ideals that seemed so repulsive to them at the beginning of the movie, but just as Enid ultimately fulfils her desires, so does Becky live out her 'seventh grade fantasy'. The important thing is not the choices people make, but whether they make choices with which they are happy.  The movie's main targets are people who betray themselves in an effort to fit in, and their resulting stupidity by doing so. But the people who have remained true to their values (like Steve Buscemi's Seymour, in a performance that should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award), are portrayed as leading equally vacuous lives. Seymour's infrequent attempts to achieve 'normality' are galling for us to observe, and near soul-destroying for him to experience.  This is an excellent movie. Thora Birch gives her most confident performance to date, and Scarlett Johansson is superbly laconic as Enid's icy side-kick. The supporting cast all shine.

The performances are wonderful,The script sparkles and the story still enthralls. John Barrymore gives one of his greatest performances as the down on his luck Baron Von Giagern,charming wistful and melencoly.Brother Lionel gives his greatest performance as the dying,but zestful Otto Kringelien.Lewis Stone is appropietly flippant and cynical as the enigmatic Dr. Otternslag and Joan Crawford shows us just how pretty and endearing she was in her early career.And then there is Garbo,the mystique that followed her to her grave must have started with her ethereal performance in this film.She is a wonder. Murder,theft,love,hate and greed...with all of this going on,I wish I could take Otternshlag's advice and \\\"stay one more day\\\".\", \"Grand hotel is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's romantic, tragic, funny and completely irresistible. The plot is great. The story would even make a good screenplay today. And the actors are brilliant. Garbo shines as the lonely ballerina, and gives the best performance in the movie. There's something so sparkling and human about her acting. I fall in love with her everytime she's seen on screen... and this movie is no exception.  As for the rest of the cast; they're great!! Although Joan Crawfords character is a bit anonymous. But her talent and beauty makes the most of it!!  Highly recommended\", \"movies from this era. Clearly acting, directing, and writing styles have changed drastically. Not to mention production values. I admit I don't always understand why some films are considered \\\"classics\\\". This is one of those films. Released in 1932, Grand Hotel must have been a wonderful escape for those living through the depression. Beautiful people, in a beautiful, rich location, living their beautiful lives. M-G-M at the time advertised that they had \\\"more stars than the heavens\\\", and they proved it with the wonderful cast in this movie.  I admire the way the different stories are interwoven and clumsily connected to each other. Off the top of my head, I can't think of another film that did this as well during this period. The opening sequence of the overhead shots and the introduction of the lead characters is also very well done, for the period. I also like the way that Jean Hersholt's(spelling?)character frames the movie. And the amount of sexuality suggested must have brought people pouring back into the theatres.  But there is no denying that many parts of this movie are pure melodrama. It is not helped by the fact that none of the lead actors would ever be accused of \\\"under playing\\\" their roles. The scene where Garbo is on the phone trying to find Barrymore, and the one towards the end with Lionel Barrymore and Wallace Beery are particularly bad. But again, that was the style of the day, so how much can you discount the film for that?  I would love to see this picture re-made, but left in the pre-WWII Berlin, and hopefully include a minor storyline of what was happening in Berlin at the time.  A wonderful artifact from Hollywood's golden age, I would rate \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" a 8 out of 10.  \", \"Best Picture winner more known for putting together the first all star cast in Hollywood. Though the cast is impressive, the movie really does have a lot more to offer than just the names on the marquee. Intertwining the stories of several different characters staying in the Grand Hotel in Berlin, the film is a wonderful collage that succeeds both artistically and emotionally. The well balanced script gives each character room to develop on their own, but also connects them perfectly to one another. More important than being all stars, the performers are all very good actors as well. John Barrymore is charming as a hotel thief down on his luck. Lionel Barrymore is nearly heartbreaking as a dying man who makes some real friends for the first time in his life. Joan Crawford gives a lovable performance as a sweet secretary, who'll do almost anything to get some extra cash. Wallace Berry is infuriating as the hard headed business man, yet he keeps from being a one dimensional bad guy. Greta Garbo also does a decent job in the film as the prime ballerina who just wants to be alone. Each performer does a good job of making you care about the character and what they are going through. Their converging story lines complement each other so well that the film never feels disjointed. Rather, we always feel that we are watching one grand picture made up of many parts.\", \"One minute in, I knew I was watching something wonderful. The scenes of the characters in phone booths lets us know immediately who they are and what they're about. We know Lionel Barrymore's dying; John Barrymore's up to something. Phone booths are supposed to be private, but we're allowed to eavesdrop on people's intimate conversations - it's thrilling, a great way to kick-start a film. By the time we entered the lobby, with that wonderful three and a half minute (I timed it!) elevated shot of everything that's going on, with the characters wandering in and out of the frame, hanging in the background, I was helplessly lost in the action. I literally said to myself: \\\"this is great\\\". A big goofy smile on my face, I watched the film get better and better.  Every single performance, with the possible exception of Garbo, is flawless. A far cry from my opinion of him in Dinner At Eight, I thought Beery was very good, delivering a blustering, dominant performance, but sad, almost child-like, at times.  Crawford (the first film of hers I've seen) was, at least to me, a revelation. I can't shake the image of her with that Baby Jane look, and I was surprised at how beautiful she was here. Her scheming is so subtle I hardly noticed it until the very end. Then I replayed her scenes in my mind and everything fit into place. Was she always this sassy? Garbo was possibly the weakest link. She was impressive, don't get me wrong, but there's something dated about her acting, something that just didn't sit right. I don't know, maybe she's too iconic. When she didn't have Barrymore to act with I felt she was lacking something.  John Barrymore was excellent. I simply cannot fault anything this man does. He's now sharing my favourite actor spot with Brando.  But Lionel Barrymore stole it. His turn as the dying, socially awkward geek living life for the first time is one of the best performances I've ever seen. Absolutely tragic. The scene immediately before he dances with Crawford made me cry. The guy was heart-breaking. From his mumbling complaints at the front desk, just trying to be heard, to his desperate search for his pocketbook, while the thief wrestles with his conscience, to his confrontation with Beery, he was note-perfect. His gesticulations, the movement of his eyes, the strained look on his face, everything screamed sadness, desperation, and dignity.  The music was perfect. It seemed to almost never stop. Waltzes echoing the way the characters danced around each other, whether it's to steal pearls, bed stenographers, coax insecure ballerinas, or confront tyrannical bosses.  The direction was often dizzying: The previously mentioned shot (and there were more than a few others) that seemed to go on forever; the shots looking down on the distant lobby far below, in all its deco glory.  Not a frame is wasted. It's one of the very few films I'd be happy to see run an hour longer. It's snappy, fast-paced, glamorous, sexy, sophisticated, funny, and ultimately tragic.\", \"(There are Spoilers) Being told by his doctor that he hasn't got long to live meek and kindly bookkeeper Otto Kringelein, Lionel Barrymore, decides to go out in grand fashion. Taking his life's savings with him, some 11,000 Marks, Otto is to spends his last days on earth in the most expensive hotel in Berlin the aptly named \\\"Grand Hotel\\\".  It's at the Grand Hotel Otto gets to meet his abusive boss, at the textile factory, Preysing, Wallace Beery, who treats him with total destine. Preysing is certain that the only way Otto can afford to stay at that swanky and expensive joint is that he embezzled his business. Otto gets his by now hot in the collar boss even madder at him by stealing his pretty stenographer Flaemmchen or Flaem for short, Joan Crawford, who sees what a creep her, like Otto's, boss the Iron Prussian-like Preysing really is.  The movie \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" also has as one of its guests the flat broke and compulsive gambler Baron Felix Von Geigern, John Barrymore. Baron Felix lost his entire fortune playing baccarat and is now in danger of getting his legs broken if he doesn't come up with the cash, 5,000 Marks, that he owes the \\\"Boys\\\" who've been backing up his losing bets. Baron Felix now on his last legs which he'll need crutches for if the \\\"Boys\\\" don't get their money is planning to rob the Great Grusinskaya, Greta Garbo, the worlds greatest ballerina who's also a guest at the hotel. The Baron concocts a plan to rob the Great Grusinskaya of her pearl necklace while she's at the Berlin Theater doing her thing: Dancing her heart out for the audience there.  Baron Felix who's only friend on earth up to that time is his cute and faithful Dachshund Adolphus, or Adolph for short, will later \\\"make it\\\" with that cold fish of a woman Grusinskaya while in the process of burglarizing her hotel suite! Catching Baron Felix off guard, by coming back to her suite early, Grusinskya is charmed by the handsome rogue who sweet talks her right out of her dance costume and into her bed; With him joining it.  It's later that the Baron after confessing his love for Grusinskaya, and returning her stolen pearl necklace, decides to use the naive Otto in a card game of baccarat he set up. This is done by Baron Felix in order to get back the money he owes the \\\"Boys\\\" before the \\\"Boys\\\" who've just about had it with him, in his stalling to pay them back their money, end up making him a cripple. The card game goes good for first-time gambler, beginners luck?, Otto who breaks the bank walking away with another, to his already 11,0000, 3,500 Marks.  With time running out on him in paying the \\\"Boys\\\" back their money a desperate Baron Felix grabs Otto's, who's dead drunk for drinking champaign, wallet with some 15,000 Marks for him to finally pay back the \\\"Boys\\\" before they pay him, in working the Baron over, back with compounded interest and fractures. ***SPOILERS***It's then that Baron Felix finally sees the light and gives up his life of a cat burglar and con-artist but only after one last fling, in robbing Preysing room, which turned out to be fatal for him.  Despite the major and established stars in the film, Greta Garbo the Barrymores and Wallace Beery, it was Joan Crawford, compared to the quality of acting talent she was up against, in a more or less supporting role who stole the films acting honors. Being both wholesome and sensuous Miss. Crawford was able to put the grubby and aggressive Preysing in his place. This was by showing him that the person whom he held in contempt, and was a rival for her affections, the sweet and soft speaking Otto was a bigger success, as a human being, that he'll ever be.   In the end the so sure of himself Preysing ended up being lead out of the Grand Hotel in handcuffs and going to jail for crimes committed by him on and off the premises. As for the meek and sensitive Otto, whom Preysing stepped on for some 30 years, he also left with Flaem for Paris to spend his last, and extremely happy, days with her at that city's \\\"Grand Hotel\\\".\", \"\\\"Grand Hotel\\\" is the kind of film that doesn't lose anything during repeated viewings. It is a marvelous MGM production that pretty much embodies the kind of thing the studio did best, during the company's most prolific era. The narrative revolves around one of Germany's most luxurious hotels, the Grand Hotel, which provides the setting for a series of interesting guests that struggle with different problems. The story is really an excuse to display glamorous stars and MGM's now famous ultra glossy production values, but who's complaining? Certainly not me. The film has an all-star cast, and it is a special treat (and lots of fun) to be able to watch each actor compete for the camera's attention. It was a smash hit when it was first released, and the film even managed to win the Oscar for Best Picture. More than seven decades later, the film has somehow retained its initial energy, thanks to the movie's fascinating cast. Watching it again, after so many years, was an enjoyable experience. I was delighted to find out that the film is still a grand piece of soapdish entertainment, and if you have yet to delved into Hollywood's early classic period of film-making, this MGM production provides a nice starting point.\", \"At first, the 1930s all-star comedy-melodrama \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" seems like the type of movie they don't make anymore. But one of the major trends in modern Hollywood is the ensemble movie where different characters' stories interweave in surprising ways, and \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" might just be the father of them all. It's not as overstuffed as some modern movies, focusing on just five characters: a hotel thief pretending to be a baron (John Barrymore), an industrial magnate (Wallace Beery), his secretary (Joan Crawford), an aging and neurotic ballerina (Greta Garbo), and a nebbishy, dying man spending his last days in the luxurious hotel (Lionel Barrymore). Their adventures are generally predictable, though always believable and in-character. Overall, the movie is a moderately fun time, especially in order to see a wide range of 1930s acting styles in one movie.  Hard to believe that Garbo and Crawford were born just months apart--they were both 26 during filming, but Garbo's world-weary ballerina looks and behaves as though she were 36. Though everyone in the film has a different acting style, Garbo's stands out the most. She swoops her chiffon sleeves and looks meltingly romantic in close-ups, as if she were still in a silent movie, but then speaks extremely flowery dialogue. At only 26, then, Garbo seems like a relic or a self-parody. Crawford, on the other hand, is a fun, sassy, modern girl, who knows both how to flirt and how to keep things from going too far. She definitely steals the movie with her tough-minded performance. Garbo's acting works in movies that consistently maintain a keyed-up romantic tone, but in the stylistic mishmash that is \\\"Grand Hotel,\\\" Garbo seems the least real--even to a 1932 audience. The DVD features reveal that her line \\\"I want to be alone\\\" got spoofed as soon as the movie came out!  John Barrymore has important scenes with both ladies, and works hard to find an acting style that complements their two very different approaches. He succeeds by playing his character as a reserved gentleman, more moderate than his scene partners. That way he can be flirtatious but not crackling with Crawford, romantic but not melodramatic with Garbo, and friendly but not effusive with his brother Lionel. Lionel, too, has a distinctive style--very mannered, stuttering, bowing and scraping as the little bookkeeper who is finally learning how to live. Yet his enthusiasm is sweet and touching. Wallace Beery gives a decent comic-villain performance complete with off-and-on German accent, though I had trouble caring about his character's money problems. I wonder, too, if the Great Depression and other events of the 1930s had some influence over the plot line where little-guy Lionel Barrymore gets the courage to stand up to the big bad CEO Beery.   Other than that, \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" is not particularly concerned with social or political problems--it's strange to think that it takes place in Weimar Germany and just two years later, the Nazis would take over. It doesn't have much emotional resonance, but it's a useful time capsule of 1932 Hollywood.\", \"Although Chaucer and Boccaccio together with many successors dealt with literary interpretations of life in urban settings involving strangers meeting in public places, Vicki Baum was among the first to bring this genre into the twentieth century world of movies and popular fiction. Neil Simon and others owe much to her concept of romanticized drama taking place in a modern hotel setting.  Unlike some other film buffs who write here from time to time, I enjoy comparing a movie version to its literary predecessor -- usually some novel or play. Neither is necessarily superior to the other; it's just that understanding the whole context of a good story lends depth and credibility to characters and their motivations.  \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" was a first not only in the era of talkies, but of bringing together an ensemble of character actors who were all stars in their own right. Garbo and the Barrymores, Crawford, Wallace Beery (compare if you can his performance with that of Gert Fr\\u00f6be in the later German version) may be seen as larger than life each in his or her own right.  It is not enough to judge this film on its own merits from the perspective of the twenty-first century. Without historical context -- including knowledge of its origins and the people who made it -- no true appreciation will be possible.  Personally, I like Baum's later film \\\"Hotel Berlin\\\" much more. But that may be because I found the book more complex and relevant. De gustibus non est disputandum. Or something like that.  \", \"A corrupt businessman. A ballerina bereft of passion. A common burglar posing as a baron. A pragmatic doctor. A dying man determined to live out his days in luxury. A porter worried about his wife. And a stenographer caught up in the mix. Combine these characters into a bowl, add a dash of star power, stir well, and you have \\\"Grand Hotel\\\", Oscar's 1932 winner for Best Picture.  It has been said that the best baseball games are based on good pitching. Along those same lines, the best movies are based on good writing. Never mind that Grand Hotel came from MGM, the most powerful studio of its day. Never mind that the cast included not one, not two, but seven of the most legendary names in Hollywood history. Never mind that it was the second of the three Best Picture winners produced by Irving G. Thalberg in a six-year span, \\\"The Broadway Melody\\\" (1929) and \\\"Mutiny On the Bounty\\\" (1935) being the other two. At its core, \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" has one of the most intricately-written scripts ever created, filled with characters as diverse and as multi-dimensional as any found in film.  Though nominated only for Best Picture (a very unique anomaly in Academy history), \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" offers not only a wonderful script, but fascinating performances from Wallace Beery (who did tie for Best Actor that year for \\\"The Champ\\\"), Greta Garbo, and an almost unrecognizable Joan Crawford, in her breakout performance. This film also has a pair of Barrymores, with Lionel as the ailing Mr. Kringelein, looking to spend his final days in the lap of luxury, and John as the dashing Baron von Geigern, a hotel thief with a soft touch.  \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" is a character-driven movie, filled with deception, intrigue, scandal, and corruption, with a murder thrown in for good measure. Of all the characters in the film, only Mr. Kringelein, who has a run of good fortune, Flaemmchen, who only wants a good opportunity, and the hotel porter Senf (Jean Hersholt), who frets throughout the film about his wife's labor, come away better at the end than in the beginning.  I think the reason \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" was not nominated for a screenplay Oscar was simply that nobody was credited with adapting the script for the movie. It is quite possible that the script was already solid enough, so that only minimal adaptation was necessary. Otherwise, it holds its own on the screen quite well.  I will not be deceptive here. \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" is a dated movie. But, on the other hand, I think it holds its own as a study of seven characters and as a successful experiment in early ensemble casting.\", \"MGM's motto was that they had more stars than there are in heaven or something to that effect. No movie proved it better than Grand Hotel. Before Grand Hotel, it would have been unthinkable to put more than two of a studios top stars in one film. MGM rolled the dice and put Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Wallace Beery, Lionel Barrymore and Joan Crawford together for a memorable film. To support them they included the best of their second string character actors such as Lewis Stone and Gene Hersholt to name but two. The gamble payed off and Grand Hotel was awarded the Best Picture Oscar. All of the stars put in a great performance but in my opinion Joan Crawford really stands out in this one. Garbo's performance is good but seems rather strained. The Barrymore brothers do a fine job. Wallace Beery is fabulous as the tough as nails industrialist who gets in over his head. MGM wouldn't wait long to try the formula again releasing another all star cast film Dinner At Eight two years later.\", \"According to Dr. Otternschlag; People come, people go. Nothing ever happens. The good old doctor couldn't be more wrong. Lots of things are happening in Grand Hotel when several different persons with different motivations check into the hotel.  The movie follows several different characters in the movie who all in a way get connected to each other. All of the characters are in the hotel for different reasons. It makes the characters very powerful and interesting to follow. The movie might not be as old fashioned as it might seem at first sight. The movie might be made in 1932 but the story and its characters sure don't feel old fashioned and the movie doesn't fall into some typical genre clich\\u00e9s. The movie is unique in many ways, which makes this movie a very enjoyable one to watch, even for those who normally don't watch early cinematic pictures.  The movie has a wonderful cast. John Barrymore is good and convincing as the thief with a good heart, Baron Felix von Geigern. Greta Garbo shines as always and so does Joan Crawford, whose performance is perhaps a bit underrated. Lionel Barrymore goes over-the-top at times but at least I could stand him this time. I normally can't stand him in movies but I must admit that he entertained and perhaps somewhat surprised me this time.  Yes, so its really the cast and diversity of characters that makes this movie a greatly interesting one to follow. At moments there is nothing much happening on screen but due to its characters the movie still remains interesting throughout its entire running time. You just never know what's going to happen next in the Grand Hotel.   It's interesting to note that the movie won an Acedemy Award for best movie but it wasn't even nominated in any other different category.  A surprising and entertaining movie that is great thanks to its characters and storytelling, which makes this movie a very good- and interesting one to watch.  8/10\", \"At Grand Hotel \\\"they come and they go\\\" utters the house doctor played by Lewis Stone. Indeed the lobby of the opulent Berlin hotel is like the world in microcosm as travelers from all over hurry through its busy foyer. A series of their stories are intertwined in which romance, suspense, tragedy await.   Over the years many films of this type (Dinner at Eight,Separate Tables, Ship of Fools, Airport,)have been produced with varying degrees of success. None have ever equaled Grand Hotel much to the credit of director William Goulding who managed to evenly distribute roles and get fine performances with a cast of the era's mega stars without having them bump into or upstage each other.   Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Lionel Barrymore and Wallace Beery all deliver classic representations of what made them stars of that period. The pace of the film moves briskly and never slows as one major star replaces another in scene after scene. The overall story itself edits well into each segment due to the well defined connections between the characters.   Naturally the scenery and set design are plush and Goulding presents it well with controlled, unobtrusive camera work. But it is the stars as a group glowing brighter than ever in a time to quote Norma Desmond when pictures were still big, the players larger than life. The physiognomy and chemistry of icons Garbo and Barrymore, Crawford before she hardened, as the working class hero, Beery at his surly best and Lionel Barrymore as the pathetic retiree stealing every scene he is in.   Grand Hotel still holds up today with its story line and performances but it is also an excellent example of a period that was about to come to an end (1932). For just outside the door's of this four star hotel National Socialists were in the streets unwittingly plotting to end everything grand about the city of Berlin.\", \"Grand Hotel is a movie about how people's lives intertwined in there brief stay in a HOTEL- in this case THE GRAND HOTEL.  Well in the beginning of the movie the Doctor guy says- \\\"Grand Hotel! People come and go\\u0085\\\" Well that is just the way the movie is. The entire movie is filmed inside the HOTEL. The story Not for once goes outside the hotel.  And well what happens outside the hotel is all left for our imaginations.  The STORY of the movie was superb. I loved it. It was SAD, True, Funny and Involving.  Well there are all kinds of characters. The Character's Story Before they came into the GRAND Hotel is never explained. Which is another Superb thing about this EXCELLENT FILM.  The Story involving so many people and the way there lives intertwined is REALLY WELL EXECUTED. And well there have been many movies after the year 2000 that have stories involving many people- with their own stories.  Well I must say the performances are all GREAT. Especially by JOAN CRAWFORD and Lionel Barrymore. The characters they portray just stole my heart. Too sad that in 1932 there wasn't any SUPPORTING ACTOR or ACTRESS AWARD. If there was than I bet Lionel and Crawford would have won EASILY.  All in all, this is a PHENOMENAL Oscar winning movie. And it is also one of the MOST important movies in the History of CINEMA.  10/10 I loved it and Enjoyed it!\", \"How wonderful, how divine, how engrossing..........it's the Grand Hotel where \\\"nothing ever happens\\\", according to Lewis Stone's character. This is one of those films that must be watched repeatedly to savor the glamour and nuances of the performances of the star-studded cast. Let's talk about the cast. GARBO: Many think she went over-the-top with her performance of the ballerina who doubts her own talent and star power. Instead I find it exactly right. She is playing an artist given to flights of fancy and eccentricity (she'd be called a diva today). Watch her as she plays her scenes with John Barrymore......she is besotted with him after their night together. It's perfect JOHN BARRYMORE: The troubled star gives it his all as the suave, desperate but basically decent Baron. He hits just the right note in his performance and it was to be his next to last great performance. JOAN CRAWFORD: \\\"WOW\\\" might be the word for her playing of the slightly dishonorable stenographer. I think this may be one of her greatest roles before she went on the likes of \\\"Mildred Pierce\\\" and her other roles of suffering women. LIONEL BARRYMORE: His character (but not his acting) is the one I like least because he is constantly cringing and apologizing; however,based on the type of role it is, he is right on the money. His scenes with his brother are extremely well done. WALLACE BEERY: Nobody could have done the blustering, egocentric magnate better than Beery. He spent a lot of his career in more comedic roles and here he shows that he can actually act.  Lewia Stone, as the disfigured doctor who is always waiting for a message (what kind of message is never made clear) is good in support as is Jean Hersholt, the head porter.  Yes, it's dated, maybe some of the dialogue is considered corny, and the performances are of the time..........and it is magnificent. Check into the Grand Hotel. You won't want to check out.\", \"MINOR PLOT SPOILERS This is set in Berlin in a beautiful, luxurious hotel. Among the tenants--there's Greta Garbo as Grusinskaya--she's a fading ballerina who is miserable and \\\"vants to be alone; John Barrymore plays the penniless Baron who falls in love with her; Lionel Barrymore plays a man who's dying of an incurable disease--but wants to go out enjoying himself; Wallace Berry plays a ruthless industrial man and Joan Crawford plays a stenographer he hires.   This was obviously a BIG production. The sets are elaborate, everything looks perfect and this was the first film with an all star cast. The script is sharp and the direction moves the story along. Garbo and Crawford are just superb--they're so young and full of life! They play their roles to perfection.  But there is one big problem here--the male actors. To put it kindly they're pretty bad. John Barrymore looks like he's a million miles away; his brother Lionel overacts to an embarrassing degree (and gets very annoying) and Berry chews the scenery. They weaken what could have been a great movie. As it stands I can only give it an 8--but it's still well worth seeing. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1932.\", \"A hotel is merely a transit station. People come, people go. Guests partake in dinner, dancing and gambling; occasionally, something more dramatic unfolds \\u0096 a man and woman fall in love, a heart is broken, a person is murdered. Then the guests leave, and new customers take their place, oblivious to the events that unfolded just the previous day. The slate is wiped clean; the hotel has a short memory. As Dr Otternschlag (Lewis Stone) knowingly muses, \\\"Grand Hotel\\u0085 always the same. People come, people go. Nothing ever happens.\\\" Edmund Goulding's Oscar-winning 'Grand Hotel (1932)' is a mere snapshot of several days in the life of Berlin's finest rest-stop, in which lives are changed forever, and yet the guests' full stories can never be known. An astonishing cast \\u0096 Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery, Jean Hersholt \\u0096 introduced a new style of storytelling, with ensemble casts of unrelated characters whose lives inexplicably interweave. A slew of imitations followed in the early 1930s, and author Graham Greene was inspired to write his first successful novel, \\\"Stamboul Train.\\\"  In 1932, the United States was still in the midst of the Great Depression, but Hollywood was optimistic. Producers knew that audiences flocked to cinemas precisely to escape their own worrisome lives, to temporarily imagine themselves beside their favourite movie stars in glittering surroundings. Films like 'Grand Hotel (1932)' and 'Top Hat (1935)' delivered on this promise, with extravagant hotel rooms and wealthy businessmen flaunting their wealth. The dreams of the working-class are depicted through Otto Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore), an unremarkable clerk whose impending death prompts him to splurge his savings and enjoy his final weeks. The cycle of life is used allegorically to symbolise the circular narrative of life at a hotel. While hotel porter Senf (Jean Hersholt) awaits news of his child's birth, a guest awaits his own death. By the film's end, one man is dead, and a baby is born. Other characters are abandoned before their stories have reached a satisfactory conclusion, mimicking the continuous nature of life itself.  The film's cast is occasionally hampered by an acting style left over from the silent era, but is otherwise excellent. John Barrymore is suave and charming as a good-hearted pearl thief, and brother Lionel is even better, offering a poignant portrait of a dying man who finally understands what living life is all about. Joan Crawford and Wallace Beery provide able support, but aren't quite as memorable as their co-stars. 'Grand Hotel' was my first film to feature actress Greta Garbo, and for a few minutes I was left wondering exactly why she is held in such high regard. Where was the subtlety in her performance? Then she smiled, and it was like the sun had risen on a new day. Perhaps Garbo hadn't yet moved on from the silent era, communicating her emotions with thick brush-strokes, but when your face can so dazzlingly light up the movie screen, there's no hurry. A modern remake of 'Grand Hotel' would be difficult. The film's impact rests largely on the glamour and reputations of its main stars, and I think it's safe to say that today's Hollywood doesn't create \\\"stars\\\" like it did in the 1930s.\", \"The only production of \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" I've ever seen that actually worked (that, in fact, was deeply moving) was the Broadway musical from the early '90s. Of course, it didn't do so well, being head and shoulders above both the original play and this \\\"all-star\\\" M-G-M romp.  There is a reason why this is the only film to win \\\"Best Picture\\\" at the Academy Awards -- and nothing else.  \\\"If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage,\\\" actors have maintained since, oh, Euripides.  Here, what's on the page is clich\\u00e9 after clich\\u00e9 -- pretentious conceits that were already old and tired by 1932.  What's fascinating is certainly not Goulding's hackneyed direction, but the various actors' more or less successful attempts to breathe real life into cardboard roles.  At the top of that list is Lionel Barrymore. In retrospect, and considering his entire filmic career, he was a far more versatile and better actor than John. One always gets a vivid character, and not Lionel Barrymore \\\"playing\\\" one. (Watch him in \\\"You Can't Take It With You,\\\" for instance, when he had to work on crutches because of his advancing arthritis. Amazing.)   Next, Joan Crawford. Third-billed, and even with added Garbo scenes to keep Crawford from walking off with \\\"Grand Hotel,\\\" she still does.  Crawford and Lionel Barrymore not only make their clich\\u00e9d lines and characters wholly believable, they literally walk off into the sunrise together at the end, as clich\\u00e9s often do.  Wallace Beery is wonderful and dimensional and even heart-breaking as Preysing. (He apparently only accepted the role because he was promised he would be the single star with a German accent.)   John Barrymore, next, does the best he can playing a Baron who wears more eye shadow than Garbo. Oh, wait: Barrymore ALWAYS wore more eye shadow than his leading ladies. Whether a carryover from his theatrical makeups during his stage career, or a misguided attempt to give his puffy alcoholic's face some screen definition, it's hard to say. What's easy to say is that he's occasionally effective here, and affecting; but mostly self-conscious. \\\"Why is that man wearing all that eye-shadow?\\\" leads to an awareness that one can almost count, beat by beat, his stagy timing of even so simple a gesture as gently chucking Crawford's chin, or his vain attempt to make a mediocre script sound like iambic pentameter. In \\\"Bill of Divorcement,\\\" with Katherine Hepburn, in this same year, he still wears more eye shadow than she, and is still given to the odd sing-song stage (as opposed to film) line reading. But he's much better. Then again, so is that play.  Then there's Garbo. Truly, a stunning film actress, an immortal phenomenon (and, as always, photographed by the brilliant William Daniels, breathtakingly beautiful). But please, out of courtesy to her talent and legend, don't compare her performance here with any of her others (\\\"Camille,\\\" say, or \\\"Ninotchka\\\" or \\\"Anna Karenina\\\"). Director Goulding allowed her favorite mannerisms to get the best of her: the constantly dancing eyebrows in closeups, the tilt-back of the head to gaze soulfully at ceilings (were cue-cards pasted up there?).  Lewis Stone gets nothing to do but embody a one-man Greek Chorus, over and over, about (to paraphrase): \\\"People come and go. But nothing ever happens in the Grand Hotel.\\\"   Adrian's costumes and Cedric Gibbons' art direction provide as much drama and character as the script. Possibly more: one finds oneself admiring the detailing in a hotel room door, or the sweep of a \\\"moderne\\\" upholstered chair in Lionel Barrymore's suite during his ecstatically played (and largely silent) drunk scene, at the expense of what's happening between the predictable characters.  Watchable? Certainly. A revelation? Yes, when Crawford and Lionel Barrymore are on screen. Great? No. It's a pretentious novel turned into a pretentious play turned into a pretentious film -- pretending to be profound, timeless and enduring.  Instead of the Grand Clich\\u00e9 that it is.\", \"Published in 1921, Vicki Baum's German-language novel MENSCHEN IM HOTEL was an international bestseller. MGM purchased the rights and employed William A. Drake to adapt the novel to the stage. Titled GRAND HOTEL, it proved a great success on the Broadway stage, and with its fame as both novel and play the studio made the property the focus of its powerful array of contract talent. It was smash with both critics and audiences and won the Academy Award as Best Picture of 1932.  Although the 1930s was notable for social dramas, audiences of the Great Depression wanted an escape from the hardship of their lives, and no expense was spared to create the glittering and very high-gloss image moviegoers craved. Designed by legendary art director Cedric Gibbons, who mixed Deco and Moderne styles to tremendous effect, each set was built specifically for the film and no detail was overlooked; Adrian's costumes were also meticulous in their combination of high-fashion and romance. No detail was overlooked, and in terms of production values alone few films before or after have bested GRAND HOTEL.  But if GRAND HOTEL is distinctly of its era in terms of visual style, it is also distinctly of its era in terms of performance, and it is here that we run into a bit of trouble. Most actors of the silent era relied on a mannered performance style that compensated for the lack of sound. The arrival of sound forced them to invent a new performance style, and some proved more adaptable than others. In many respects, GRAND HOTEL is a study of the struggle to invent this new way of acting; some of the performers are excessively large, some are in transition between silent and sound modes, and some are distinctly modern in their approach.  In terms of story, GRAND HOTEL presents several overlapping and interweaving plot lines. Celebrated ballerina Grusinskaya (Garbo) is performing in Berlin--and is a deep depression that threatens her career. Baron von Geigern (John Barrymore) is in desperate need of money--and has agreed to steal Grusinskaya's famous pearls. When Grusinskaya's suicide attempt collides with the Baron's intended theft, romance is result. At the same time, industrialist Preysing (Wallace Beery) has arrived at the hotel in an effort to conclude a important business deal and has hired a stenographer named Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford) to assist him--but Preysing is unaware that company accountant Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and has taken rooms at the hotel, determined to enjoy himself before he dies. These characters, along with Grusinskaya's maid (Rafaela Ottiano), the hotel doctor (Lewis Stone), and various hotel employees (including Jean Hersholt) collide repeatedly over the course of a few days--and none will emerge entirely unscathed from their encounters.  John Barrymore was noted for his larger-than-life performances on the stage, and he brought that same quality to many silent films; less fortunately, he also carried into the sound era, and his performance reads as excessively large. Although Garbo was a great star in the silent era, she quickly adapted to the new demands of sound in such films as ANNA Christie--but when faced with Barrymore's over-the-top performance she responds in kind, and the result is visually beautifully but incredibly mannered, and their scenes are not greatly aided by their dialogue, which is itself very much in \\\"the grand manner.\\\" Although they are indeed fascinating, their performances are distinctly out of synch with the rest of the film, where a more natural style of acting is the norm.  While Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone are quite good, and while Lionel Barrymore is unexpectedly effective (and much less mannered than his brother John), it is really Joan Crawford that points the way toward the new acting style. Crawford herself had worked in silents, and scored notable successes in such films as OUR DANCING DAUGHTERS, but she has made an easy leap to the sound era and never overplays her hand; Flaemmchen is among the best of her early performances, and Crawford herself thought it among the best of her overall career. She wasn't wrong.  With the acting styles all over the map, GRAND HOTEL requires a modern viewer to make constant mental shifts; consequently, the film sometimes feels more than a little uphill. Even so, there are plenty of compensations: Garbo at the height of her beauty; Lionel Barrymore's multi-layered performance; a Crawford classic; and always, always the lush look and feel of the movie. Although I think it will most appeal to film buffs, there is no denying the thing has power, even though that power has become somewhat obscured by the passing years.  GFT, Amazon Reviewer\", \"Edmund Goulding's Grand Hotel is a perfect example of how a flawed film can still be great because of its blemishes, and not in spite of them. Winner of the Best Picture Academy Award of 1933 (but not even nominated in any other category), it is an indisputable classic that stands apart as one of the finest (and most timeless) motion pictures of the 30's -- which was a terrific decade for the cinema. The story structure was essentially unprecedented -- with the exception of that same year's Freaks, which was unprecedented in practically every way possible -- in that it featured multiple characters with independent relationships and intertwining narratives (in other words, it laid the groundwork for every Robert Altman film ever made -- Gosford Park in particular). Greta Garbo plays a dancer staying at a hotel along with a thief disguised as a baron (John Barrymore), a young and beautiful stenographer (Joan Crawford), a stern businessman (Wallace Beery), a fidgety social outcast trying to enjoy what's left of his life (Lionel Barrymore), and a mysterious doctor (Lewis Stone). The mysticism and coincidence of multiple people dealing with secret issues in the same location remains one of the most compelling and intriguing film techniques out there (see Todd Solondz's Happiness and P.T. Anderson's Magnolia), and it was certainly more compelling than most of what was being produced by Hollywood at the time (in spite of the fact that this WAS a great time for film, most pictures relied on very conventional and often contrived styles to achieve their popularity). So to think that the Academy once recognized such offbeat masterpieces makes you wonder what happened to them over the past few years. Even after 70+ years, Grand Hotel remains just as brilliant and fascinating as it was to begin with -- if not more: each character is as dynamic and enthralling as the next, and each frame is filled with surprises and idiosyncrasies. Perhaps Pauline Kael put it best when she wrote, \\\"If you want to see what screen glamour used to be, and what originally 'stars' were, this is perhaps the best example of all time.\\\" Indeed, the stars in Grand Hotel are true stars, the foremost being Garbo: while often cited as one of the great actresses, few seem to recall how mesmerizing Garbo truly was. She hardly ever appeared to be acting, yet every gesture she made and every word she spoke was magnificently overdone -- as would have been necessary during her silent roles. And even though her beauty is far from conventional, it is truly undeniable. When first released, Crawford was notoriously frustrated that Garbo received top billing (she was rumored to have always arrived late on the set, playing Marlene Dietrich records in between cuts just because she knew they were Garbo's pet peeves), but to me this only enhances the characters: Crawford's role is supposed to be more subdued (afterall, she IS the stenographer and Garbo IS the celebrity in the film). Perhaps the most impressive performance of all is Lionel Barrymore's: as a bumbling, overly anxious everyman who has been ignored his entire life, he is completely and utterly heart-breaking; there is not a single moment when he isn't in character (and the same goes for the rest of the cast). His real-life brother John Barrymore is equally outstanding, providing a suave counterpart to Lionel's subtle melancholy. Goulding's direction is nothing short of spectacular: his innovative use of close-ups and repeated set-ups is something to be admired -- especially at a time when there was no precedent for these methods. The script (which was originally a play) is filled with both wit and insight (yet no Oscar nod?). Earlier in this review I made mention of the film's supposed flaws, and Grand Hotel is indeed far from perfect; many of the cuts are rough and uneven, and some of the plot developments come off as sudden and unbelievable, but the film is only better for it. Its faults give it an edge that would have otherwise been replaced by an overly polished look which wouldn't be nearly as compelling. All in all, Grand Hotel is an absolute masterpiece, plain and simple. Watch it and be amazed.  Grade: A+  (#88 on my All-Time Top 100 list.

Grusinskaya (Greta Garbo) is a dancer in crisis who falls in love for Baron Felix Von Geigern (John Barrymore, the grandfather of the sweet Drew Barrymore). The Baron is a bankrupted noble, a very gentle and refined person, but indeed a thief of hotel rooms. Preysing (Wallace Beery) is a tough businessman, dealing in Berlin an important contract. Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford) is officially an stenographer and also an expensive 'working girl', making programs with her clients. Otto Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) is a sick man who had worked most of his life as an accountant in one of the Preysing's company. During these days, one of these characters is murdered by another one. In the end, Grand Hotel is a place where people come, go, and nothing ever happens, in accordance with the definition of one character. Yesterday I saw this movie for the first time. The first point that called my attention was the constellation of the stars sharing lead roles: none of the previously mentioned character has less importance in the story. The long shots, with lots of figurants in the lobby of Grand Hotel, are very impressive. The beauty of Greta Garbo, who has a very theatrical performance, and Joan Crawford are amazing, even for the present standards. Unfortunately the quality of the image and sound of the Brazilian VHS is horrible. My vote is nine.  Title (Brazil): 'Grand Hotel'\", \"What was a great movie in 1932 is still a good movie in 1999. In the Grandest Hotel of them all as \\\"People come, people go. (but) Nothing ever happens.\\\" This is a story of a day at the hotel. Nothing out of the ordinary occurs, except lots of drinking, gambling, a love triangle, .... This film is one of the last big-budget \\\"studio\\\" Hollywood movies from its era (20's-30's) and is frequently studied for both this aspect and its photographic techniques (like the revolving doorway). The two hours is well worth it. Lionel Barrymore's performance is also really memorable.\", \"I still like this film. It has some grievous over-acting by Garbo as a ballerina on the skids. But the film works for all that. Grushinskaya has passed her prime as a ballerina, and her world weariness masks her awareness that her days of international greatness are over. She has nothing to look forward to - in fact her position is not that different from Anne Bancroft in THE TURNING POINT, who can teach ballet, but has no family life to comfort her like her old friend/rival Shirley MacLaine does.  She momentarily does get a shot for happiness in retirement: she meets Baron Geiger (John Barrymore) and finds he would be able to satisfy her. And he finds she would be fine for him. But his problem is he is broke, and owes his criminal partners for the money that set him up in this great hotel in Berlin. He has to pay them back - he was going to steal Grushinskaya's jewels, but he won't do that now.  GRAND HOTEL is like that, every time you watch it. It was written in the aftermath of World War I, and keeping that in mind you see the fractured bodies and lives that are colliding in the hotel. Lewis Stone, for example, is the man who makes the famous statement about \\\"nothing ever happens\\\" at the conclusion of the film. His Doctor Otternschlag is the hotel doctor, and is not very observant (by the time he makes the comment a murder has occurred in the hotel, and he is unaware of it). His face is scarred by a gas attack in the war. The war has probably made the doctor relatively quiet - and seeking quiet as much as possible. Hence his blindness. Wallace Beery is Preysling the textile manufacturer who is there for a big business conference and is facing bankruptcy - as was all of Germany (which had terrible inflation in 1923, due to war reparation and debt). Geiger's Pre-war cushion of wealth and position were swept away with the Hohenzollern dynasty in 1918. He was unlucky enough to survive his world, and most of his friends. And the small fry in the film: Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) and Flaemchen (Joan Crawford) find their futures in considerable doubt too. Lionel is dying (we are never quite sure of what, but it sounds like it's industrial related - he works for Preysling's firm), and Crawford is aware that secretaries are a dime a dozen and needs to better herself - even if it means sleeping with the likes of Preysling. One can also add Senf (Jean Hersholt) who has to stay at his hotel job, while his wife is facing a dangerous childbirth which is worrying him to death.  The collisions between the characters is fascinating too, as the Pre-war standards of social class is up in the air now. Preysling is aware of his feet of clay but he is still known as a big textile manufacturer to the public. So he is not deeply impressed by John Barrymore's Baron, but every time they confront each other, the Baron's superior breeding outshines Preysling's pompous bluster. Kringelein too is confronted by Preysling who thinks the bookkeeper's appearance at that expensive hostelry suggests embezzlement. Kringelein not only shows that he is not in a position to be threatened by police or discharge, but adds that Preysling's blunders are such as to have merited being fired if he hadn't been boss. Preysling does make a kind of headway with Flaemchen but it is only on a cash basis - she really is far friendlier to the Baron and Kringelein.  GRAND HOTEL had been a major Broadway stage success when it was acquired by MGM. Preysling was originally played by Siegfried Ruman (later Sig Ruman) and the Baron by Albert Van Dekker (later Albert Dekker). Neither ended up in the MGM production, though both had distinguished film careers later on. The producer of the film was Paul Bern, who would be found dead in his home in 1932 just before the final cut was made on the movie. This is not the spot to analyze whether Bern was a suicide (officially he was) or was murdered by his wife (Jean Harlow) or some other person (a previous wife who killed herself a day or so afterward), but it led to Bern's friend and mentor Irving Thalberg completing the film as producer. Neither man's name is on the credits. However, Bern's hand is on the film - including the casting. He would have been facing a great producing career if he had lived.  The most notable thing about the leads is that (except for Garbo's Swedish accent - here as a Russian ballerina) only Beery tries a German accent. It comes and goes, unfortunately, but Beery's lost bull in the china shop performance is good enough not to be harmed by it. Preysling is a weak man, who married the boss's daughter to get ahead but lacked the brains to keep the firm going. In the end he has to lie to try to survive his conference with rival Tully Marshall. Unfortunately he cannot control his passions and anger.  It is said on this thread that Buster Keaton was supposed to play Kringelien. Presumably his alcoholism prevented it. But Lionel Barrymore gives a good accounting as the dying man. Yet Buster actually liked the idea. He tried to create interest in a comedy to star himself, Edward Everett Horton, and Marie Dressler called GRAND MILLS HOTEL, set in the \\\"infamous\\\" flop house in Manhattan. The same blending of the film's plots would have occurred. It never got beyond the drawing board. Laurel & Hardy would have been in the Tully Marshall and Wallace Beery roles, as button manufacturers who are trying to make a contract. Pity, it might have been a good comedy.\", \"Edmund Goulding's 1932 film \\\"Grand Hotel\\\", about 48 hours in a plush German hotel has a dream cast. Grusinskaya (Greta Garbo) is a Russian prima ballerina in town for several performances, who is lonely, a drama queen, and suicidal. She meets Baron von Geigern (John Barrymore) a hotel thief who inadvertently is in her room (having been in the process of stealing some jewelry) when she is about to commit suicide, and stays the night with her, convincing her not to end things. The two fall in love, of course, much to the disappointment of Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford), a woman that von Geigern was romancing the day before. Flaemmchen is a stenographer, and her boss, German tycoon Preysing (Wallace Beery) is having a hard time with a merger he is trying to transact. One of Preysing's employees at a factory he owns is bookkeeper Otto Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore). Otto is staying at the hotel because he only has a short time to live, so he takes his entire life savings and decides to live the rest of his life in luxury. Throughout the 48 hours that the action takes place, friendships are made, loves are found and lost, and a murder changes the lives of all of the main characters.  \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1932, and it is easy to see why. The film is an epic without having an enormous cast or exotic locales. From the films that I have seen of this decade, this is one of the first examples of an intertwining narrative structure. We are used to seeing this now; (think Altman, in particular) where characters are all somehow connected, even though they may not even know each other. Another fine early example that I can recall was a decade later with \\\"Tales of Manhattan\\\". The acting is incredible, though Garbo's REALLY over-the-top performance was a bit much. Realizing that she was a drama queen as a profession, I excused a lot of it, but it got to a point where I was really snickering to myself after awhile, because she was acting just like Gloria Swanson later would in \\\"Sunset Boulevard\\\". One explanation could be that this was still a really early stage of the talking picture, and silent films solely relied on gestures and facial expressions to convey emotion. I was very impressed with the performances of the Barrymore brothers (I've always loved Lionel Barrymore), and was stunned by Crawford's talent as well as beauty.  \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" is rife with melodrama, but it was not hackneyed or maudlin. I am actually quite surprised it isn't on the IMDb top 250 list; I found it to be that good. I am a big fan of Douglas Sirk's melodramatic films of the 1940's and 1950's, and \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" is a great predecessor of that genre. 7/10 --Shelly\", \"Grand Hotel remains surprisingly effective even today, and as some reviewers have suggested, is a precursor to Robert Altman's style of film-making, in which many characters interact and bounce off one another in unexpected ways. The action moves at a quick pace, as the scene constantly shifts between the characters. Director Edmund Goulding even utilized \\\"wipes\\\" to change the scene, which must have seemed very high-tech back in the early 1930's.  The narrative form is fluid, allowing each character to nicely develop his or her storyline in relation to the others. A story like Grand Hotel could easily become staid and set-bound, especially considering it was taken from a play, but the interesting sets, exquisite costumes, and the countless players keep the excitement level high.  The performances are certainly first-rate, as one would expect from the A-list cast. I do realize that many of today's viewers find Greta Garbo's aging Russian ballerina to be an exercise in over-indulgence, but I do enjoy her immensely! And who here today actually knows for certain how an aging Russian ballerina would act out when alone in her hotel room or with her entourage? Have today's critics spent time with Garbo's contemporary Pavlova, and found her by example to be much more subdued and controlled? It is not too much of a stretch to believe that Garbo's Grusinskaya may have existed in the actuality of 1932.  And what fun it is watching her as she goes through every emotion imaginable! Her great voice was always one of her best tools, and she certainly uses it to advantage here, throwing away lines that other actresses would have played up, and vice-versa. And the tight close ups of her beautiful face are breathtaking! I will only mention one scene specifically: when she futilely attempts to telephone her lover, the Baron, in the middle of the night. Alone on the screen she pleads for him to pick up, at times excited and joyful, quickly turning into desperation and despair and back again. She cradles the telephone receiver as if it were her lover.  Another knock-out performance comes from the young Joan Crawford, who in this huge production proved to the world she was an excellent actress who could hold the screen with any seasoned pro. As the shapely stenographer Flaemmchen, Crawford is absolutely stunning, as beautiful as Garbo, and a sexuality that certainly made guys in the audience take careful notice. And the profile of her extraordinary face was surely as \\\"great\\\" as John Barrymore's more famous one! She lends a distinct eroticism to her role, as she expertly delivers her character's suggestive dialogue, often with an resigned air of cynicism or jaded pessimism.  Of the male characters, Wallace Beery definitely commands attention! His portrayal of the desperate industrialist Preysing is both repellent and charismatic. As a man who exudes power and slowly begins to lose control, his performance is expertly crafted and layered. And I'd be remiss not to mention the Barrymore brothers, who round out the cast superbly. John charms both the men and women on screen with natural ease, while Lionel whimpers and whines like no other ever could. Both their characters are heartbreaking, each in his individual way. Even lesser characters, like Lewis Stone's horribly scarred doctor (in make-up that truly is disturbing) and Rafaela Ottiano's maid have their moments in the spotlight.  Minor spoiler ahead:  One scene that I found poignant was the bell boy quickly escorting the Baron's poor pet dachshund out the hotel lobby by its leash. They pass a janitor sweeping the floor with a large push broom, who without reason shoves the small dog along with the broom, causing it to stumble. The poor thing, wondering what hit it, turns around as it scoots along, only to have the janitor sweep a cloud of dust into its face. A truly sad small moment, as the viewer is left to wonder what will become of the dog now that it has lost its status as the beloved pet of a nobleman.  End of minor spoiler  Yes, Grand Hotel still remains splendid entertainment!\", \"Vicky Baum's novel \\\"Menschen I'm Hotel\\\" serves as the basis for this 1932 film that was a vehicle for Greta Garbo. \\\"Grand Hotel\\\", as directed by Edmund Golding, was a magnificent film that had a lot of first class stars of the era in prominent roles. In fact, this seems to be one of the first films to have relied in the prominent \\\"names\\\" it gathered to portray the different characters in the movie.  By today's standards, the film is dated, but for a discriminating film fan, \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" is a classic because of the star turns one witnesses. Also, today's fans have to make concessions for the style of acting that was prevalent at the time. The movies have begun \\\"talking\\\" not long before this film was made and the stars of those silents were still doing their acting in front of the camera as though no one was going to hear them talk. In fact, most of the complaints in comments submitted to this forum would have been different if this was 1932 and the film had just come out.  The best advice for anyone new to this film is to sit back, relax, and enjoy the trials and tribulations of the people seen at Berlin's Grand Hotel.  The biggest surprise of the film is the shortness of Greta Garbo presence in the film, in which for some unknown reason, she looms large above the rest of the players. As the Russian ballerina Grusinskaya, Ms. Garbo played one of the best characters of her career. Her way of acting is still imbued with what was expected of her.  John Barrymore as the Baron Von Geigern, the impoverished nobleman, is key to the story. The moment he meets the great Grusinskaya, he is lost forever. Lionel Barrymore is excellent as the poor Otto Kringelein, who thinks he is going to die real soon. Joan Crawford, is the stenographer Flaemmchen who seems to arise passion among all the men she meets. Ms. Crawford does excellent work in a role she discarded later on in favor of more dramatic appearances.  What makes \\\"Grand Hotel\\\" the timeless classic it became is the magnificent camera work by William H. Daniels, a man who knew how to get the best out of Greta Garbo in their many films together. Also the music which is from Franz Lehar's \\\"The Merry Widow\\\" serves as a nice distraction in the background.  The most famous phrase in the film \\\"I want to be alone\\\", seems prophetic in retrospect as the divine Garbo had about eight more years in the movies.\", \"The idea of a multi-level story peopled by an all star cast was brand new with this feature which deservedly won an Oscar for Best Picture though it received no other nominations. Garbo is marvelous as the world-weary ballerina who finds ill-fated romance and John Barrymore is perfect as the suave Baron. The brilliant supporting performances of a young, fresh Joan Crawford as Flaemchen, the stenographer, and Lionel Barrymore as the dying Kringelein deserved Oscars but the category hadn't been invented yet. The cast works together superbly and the direction moves along at a good pace, giving us both romance and drama in equal doses. The script is excellent and MGM's production values are quite fine. Truly a film classic and a must-see.\", \"Some seventy-odd years after its release in 1932, GRAND HOTEL today holds an interesting attraction more for the presence of its two leading ladies than from its cinematic power, although there will be some purists who will state that because the images of Joan Crawford and Greta Garbo have been immortalized in their own respective canons, that in itself is cinematic power. I personally won't argue, preferring to stick to my own personal views instead of following the herd.  I've seen GRAND HOTEL twice now, and I'll grant it that despite its soap-opera like story lines, there seems to be something a little deeper going on which is only alluded to in the sidelines: the delicate tightrope which Flammchen (Joan Crawford) walks on as she is courted by Presyling (Wallace Beery) and later on decides to stay by Otto Kringelein's (Lionel Barrymore) side. This was most probably unintentional since sources state that the screenplay follows the story closely, but today's values would have Flammchen behave much differently. I find her character to be the moral opposite of Barbara Stanwyck's amoral Lily Powers in BABY FACE, another woman who uses her sexuality to advance to the top. Joan Crawford's Flammchen doesn't actively use her charms as sort of glide by while positively glowing and stealing all of the light from Garbo, and one can sense that were she of a much different nature, all of the men in GRAND HOTEL would have a dangerous young woman to deal with, and Barrymore's end would be similar to J. Howard Marshall's demise in the hands of (a much smarter, less coked-up) Anna Nicole Smith. She'd more than likely wind up owning the hotel herself in no time.  But not to digress. The plot moves along in a nice pace thanks to Goulding's direction; never does it linger on too much on one specific character, though at least for me, anytime Garbo was on screen the story came to a crashing halt. I'm going to get a lot of flack from rabid Garbo fans, but I don't get \\\"her allure, her mystery,\\\" the essence that made her so intriguing. At twenty-seven, she already looks ten years older thanks to her severe nature. Her face is constantly in a frown, moody, full of angst reflected in her throaty voice. Her performance is so atrociously mannered I can see Jennifer Jason Leigh easily out-doing her, but better, more authentic (anyone who recalls her exacting yet eccentric portrayal of Dorothy Parker can easily see her becoming and improving Garbo). I never got to see what her character with the unpronounceable name was all about; no true trauma, just this death-wish to be \\\"left alone.\\\" Then she capriciously takes on with the Baron von Geigern (a dashing yet shady John Barrymore) who is more interested in her jewels but tells her he could love her; he out-acts her at every turn with subtlety and genuine charm even when his part seems underwritten. In short, Garbo, for all her \\\"mystique\\\" is the sore thumb of GRAND HOTEL.  I much prefer the events surrounding Crawford and the older Barrymore. Lionel Barrymore, the horrible villain from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, plays a meek former bookkeeper who is at the end of his life and wants to enjoy his stay at the hotel. His wish is quite simple: he wants to enjoy his last days, a diametric opposite to Garbo who wants to be alone (and she says it three times). He teams up with Crawford, enjoys a dance with her and falls for her even though she's much too young. All the time I got the sensation he knew the character of Kringelein, a man who has been pushed around by Preysling and is still not quite free of his micromanaging shadow. There is not a shed of ego in his performance. One can imagine seeing Crawford reach out to the older gentleman and actually making his days happier and is a fitting ending to her own storyline as she is lecherously pursued by Wallace Beery and romanced by John Barrymore. If anything, her character is the most sympathetic of the five main characters and the symbol of the emerging modern woman of the Thirties: ambitious but girlish, efficient but not a workaholic, smart and independent despite struggling to make ends meet.  GRAND HOTEL hasn't aged well. Its values were the thing back in the Depression era, showing glossy characters who were all looking for some form of security while surrounded by the exuberance of the hotel and who were not given much depth in their characterizations. The characters are more or less archetypes and are predicted to act in a certain way, and when their fates collide, it's (now) not a surprise. Now, what it did do was set the standard for lavish productions involving a roster of well-known actors and stars in a perfect balance of talent and star-power, most notably seen today in the films of Woody Allen and Robert Altman, but closer to the less intellectually challenging type of high-profile film seen in the 50s and throughout the 70s. I enjoyed it then and now and regard it as a classic film set in a pre-Code Hollywood that has its own ancient beauty, for more reasons than Garbo's mannered face.\", \"It's interesting that the Best Picture of the year before Hitler came to power in Germany, set in Germany, made no mention of the political situation in the country at the time. There was mention of the Depression Germany and the rest of the world was in and all five of the principal players were affected by it, one way or another. John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, Greta Garbo, Wallace Beery, and Joan Crawford all check into the Grand Hotel one day and their lives are never the same.   Greta Garbo is the temperamental Russian ballerina Grusinskaya and her artistic tantrums are getting less and less tolerable in many ways because of the Depression. John Barrymore is the aristocrat now living in genteel poverty. His world ended with World War I, but the Depression reduced him to being a sneak thief. Lionel Barrymore is the terminally ill bookkeeper who now just wants to spend his last days living it up. He's just going to ignore the Depression. Wallace Beery is the Prussian industrialist who's used to high living having married the boss's daughter, but his firm as so many others is about to go under unless he can pull off a merger. Lionel Barrymore is one of hundreds who work for him and know what an extremely little man he is, that Beery is really lacking in any real ability for business. Finally there's Joan Crawford who's a working class girl, hired as a stenographer by Beery who has other things on his mind for Crawford.  Whether in Germany or America Joan Crawford is the eternal shop girl. To her credit she does not attempt any kind of a Teutonic accent and her performance rings true. This is in complete contrast to Susan and God where she was consciously trying to imitate Gertrude Lawrence from the stage. This was the Depression in America too and many could identify with her.  No one epitomized class and old world elegance like John Barrymore, he was not better on film than here in Grand Hotel. He hates the life that poverty has reduced him to. Using his old world charm as a facade for being a thief tears him inside. Meeting Greta Garbo gives him a last chance at redeeming his life.  Garbo's performance is one of her best as well. I'm not sure any other actress could have made you sympathize with the temperamental ballerina. In the hands of anyone less skilled, the audience would have sympathized with the management of her ballet company who want to can her. When John Barrymore enters her life he's like the audience she entertained over the years rolled up in one person who still cares about her the individual. It's a last chance for happiness for her as well.  Wallace Beery had a funny thing not happened to him in Grand Hotel which I won't reveal might have been quite comfortable with the regime to come in Germany. Beery is the only one in the film to attempt any kind of Germanic speech and he does succeed in his portrayal of the hateful industrialist Preysing.  My favorite in Grand Hotel has always been Lionel Barrymore. Lionel may very well have been the most talented in the Barrymore family. Playing the gentle, terminally ill Kringelein is light years different from Mr. Potter in It's A Wonderful Life or Captain Disko Troup in Captains Courageous. Three very different roles yet Lionel Barrymore imprints his personality on every one. A meek little man, he's got courage enough now, courage that comes when you have absolutely nothing to lose.  Grand Hotel is now 75 years old. The style of acting you see here is old fashioned indeed, no one could remake Grand Hotel today in the same style. It's melodramatic, but it works. It's a fascinating look into the last days of the Weimar Republic as seen from the balcony of a suite at the Grand Hotel in Berlin.\", \"A world-weary prima ballerina, desperate for love. A noble cat thief, desperate for money. A dying clerk, out on a last fling. His industrialist boss, passionate & brutal. A pretty young stenographer, willing to do almost anything to get ahead. A hotel bell captain, anxious to hear about his pregnant wife. And a cynical, war-scarred doctor. Destiny awaits them all in one of Europe's most renowned establishments - Berlin's GRAND HOTEL.  This is considered to be the first `all star' movie. It was certainly MGM's most opulent film up to that time. The studio loaded it with an A List of star performers:   Greta Garbo, uttering her trademark phrase, `I want to be alone.' Radiant in love, one can only imagine the despair that awaits her after the film ends.  John Barrymore, suave, sophisticated & ultimately tragic.  Lionel Barrymore, in a performance that will stay in your memory, slowly dying.  Wallace Beery in a heavy role, all bullying bluff & bluster.  Joan Crawford, tough as nails & good as gold.  Lewis Stone, Jean Hersholt, Rafaela Ottiano & Ferdinand Gottschalk all lend sterling support.  There was concern that putting so much talent into one film, instead of spreading the stars out over 4 or 5 films, would lose the studio money. Not to worry. It was a great success, financially & critically. Watch how the plot weaves the threads of the characters' lives into a finished tapestry. One of the great movies.

Essentially Hellboy is a kind of demon who has found his way on earth. He is brought up from a child by a priest and within a government society and has chosen to protect the people of earth from the supernatural, rather then be a menace (the normal career route for a demon).  The set up of the story involves creative uses of history, combining Nazi experiments with the occult. It's preposterous, but so is the whole idea of a demon roaming the streets. I find the explanations of the characters, who they are and how they came to be very well handled. The sequences are to the point and very entertaining. In fact the opening is the best part of the film, therein lays the problem\\u0085.  Essentially Del Toro who both writes and directs this piece bottles it. The film is absent of all tension or any major conflict. Hellboy is essentially established as invincible within the first act and so the rest of the film comprises of scenes in which any conflict is automatically rather crass because we know inevitably Hellboy will be OK and the bad guy will die. I hear you cry that this is the case for any action/hero film. Well yes it is, but once we are drawn into a well made action film we can't help but feel the hero may die. Die Hard works because John Mclane looks likely to die at all parts. He escapes death by the slimmest of margins. The stakes are raised as his wife is also in danger etc etc\\u0085 Terminator and Terminator two work because in both cases the villain is far superior than the hero. The threat and tension is constant.  Some of the other major weaknesses are: Del Toro is also guilty of employing deus ex machina. Characters generally disappear and reappear as their skills are needed within the story. The villain is featured in maybe three scenes. He has no motives. Turns up unexpectedly and inexplicably. In the one scene Hellboy looks to be up against a real threat (groups of monsters) a character unleashes her abilities - the screen fades to white and inexplicably the monsters are dead but everybody else lives. A minor character established in an irritating and undeveloped love story becomes the key to the conclusion of the film. Her character is so thin, the relationship so undeveloped. It is clear she is nothing more than a prop of sorts to push the plot along and to make it all make sense. I don't want to ruin the ending of the film but essentially a character that is dead is miraculously and unbelievably brought back to life\\u0085.  The film suffers from poor dialogue and one liners that just aren't smart or funny. After a while it all starts to grate.  What's more Del Toro blows the action scenes with some uninspired visuals. And whoever made the creative decision to make hellboy's primary weapon a gun instead of his clunking arm should be fired. Essentially the use of the gun weakens the concept of the film, degrading the fights to nothing more than a one sided shoot out   The few positives include: The cinematography is very good. At all times a sense of mood is established by the dark lighting and the darker colour palette. As well as the use of interesting locations. Yet perhaps it is all a bit samey as well.  The use of cgi and Fx is well done. Never do we get an over load. When effects are used they are used well and the sense of realism is kept. Rather similar to how Nolan used FX in batman. I much prefer this method to the overtop effects we often see.  All in all this is a pretty poor film. The real shame is that (despite not reading the comics) I found the film wasted a lot of potential. Hellboy as a character has a lot of instantly apparent fascinating dimensions which are completely unexplored. The film has watch-ability, in the sense that if it comes on TV and nothing else is on it might be worth a viewing.

This movie is worthy of all the praise it gets. One thing I realized while watching this film, a lot of the classic comedies are founded on good witty dialogue.

Given a choice, give me the classics any day.   ***1/2 (Out of 4)\", \"This was a pretty good film, but I did not find it as awesome as apparently most people did. Cary Grant was in fine form, and I was impressed with Rosalind Russell. I haven't seen much of her earlier work, and always thought of her as the Mother Superior in \\\"The Trouble With Angels\\\". She was quite beautiful here, and played her role with the feistiness it required. But the whole thing left me a bit cold, and not for the reasons mentioned by others (overrunning dialog, insensitive plot elements like suicide and execution, politically incorrect references to black folks). Interestingly, I felt the same way when I saw Billy Wilder's version with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matheau. With the cast and directors of both films among my favorites, I'm at a bit of a loss as to why I didn't care all that much for these films. I suppose that I simply wouldn't have cared for the original play, and all dissatisfaction stems from that\", \"Grant and Russell are comedy gold in this picture. They have an excellent comedic chemistry. Russell deliver's Hildy's lines so naturally it was as though MacArthur and Hecht wrote that dialog for her, specifically. and still maintained the grit of the original.  I've never been a big fan of Ralph Bellamy but he plays the bright-eyed innocent with zest. And Grant is deliciously reprehensible as Walter Burns. I have trouble seeing what Hildy saw in him during their first marriage and that's as it should be.  My only quibble is the inevitable 'woman gives up her own life for a man' scenario that is so much a part of 30's, 40's and 50's cinema post-code. Hildy is most alive when she's chasing the story and Russell looks a touch uncomfortable playing the 'little woman' moments. Less believable.  All in all the best of the film versions.\", \"Howard Hawks was completely on top of his game when he shot this film. It is an enduring, eternal film classic.  He took an already popular story, \\\"The Front Page\\\", and fixed it by creating the female Hildy.

So he hands around the scripts, and discovers there aren't enough men. A woman gets the Hildy part.  And the rest, movie-lovers, is Cinema History. What a master stroke!  Great casting! Great acting! Great direction, and photography! Great screenplay that nicely serves up Big City Corruption and dances around the unscrupulous abuse of 1st Amendment freedoms by the Press.

Perfectly pairing Grant and Russell with an excellent script by Charles Lederer, based on Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's 1931 play, *The Front Page*, it is the kind of studio magic that could occur when the powers-that-be assigned the best work to the best candidates. Grant, whom I found arrogant and repellant later in his career \\u0096 not to mention redundant \\u0096 is at his suave-and-smooth best here as Walter Burns, newspaper editor,, with the perfect foil in Rosiland Russell.

Hildy is off to marry Bruce, played by Bellamy, but her ex, Walter, still needs her to be his star reporter and cover the execution of a convicted killer. Every early journalistic stereotype is in full force \\u0096 from reporters who would stop at nothing to get their story, to the city editor with a visor and sleeve-garters. Gene Lockhart, Ernest Truex and Clarence Kolb are all in fine form, but even the finest supporting performances pale against Grant and Russell. They are both delightful in this stylish slapstick farce that had previously been filmed as *The Front Page* (and later, again as *The Front Page* in 1974, and as *Switching Channels*). It also spawned a slew of imitators, not the least of which was TV's *Moonlighting*.

I can't just watch one scene. Whenever it's on I'm hooked for the duration.  The snappy patter, split-second timing and overlapping dialogue is enough to make you want the script for re-reading after the credits have run.  They don't make 'em like this any more.\", \"terrific script, great performances, grant & russell are terrific together. the film is full of funny little inside jokes from cary grant's \\\"the last person who said that to me was archie leach...\\\" to \\\"you know, bruce. he looks like ralph bellamy.\\\" love it, love it, love it. and rosalind russell is my kinda babe!   - bdp\", \"This movie is my favorite of all time. The dialogue is spectacular, and is delivered with such rapid-fire speed that one viewing is not enough. The film comedy was elevated to new heights with Howard Hawks outstanding direction. Based on the classic play \\\"The Front Page\\\", Hawks gives it a delightful twist by presenting Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant as an estranged couple of newspaper journalists who haven't quite written the final line of their love story. Ralph Bellamy is great as the beleaguered as strait-laced Bruce Baldwin who is the perfect comic victim of Grant's devious deals to get Russell back. Everyone who has ever enjoyed a comedy from \\\"Airplane\\\" to \\\"Blazing Saddles\\\" owes a debt to this movie.  It's an AMC cable channel staple, and rightfully so. It's a 9 1/2 out of 10.\", \"This is perhaps Cary Grant's funniest film (I'd rank it a hair behind \\\"Arsenic and Old Lace\\\") The rat-a-tat dialogue has rarely been so perfectly timed as between he and Rosalind Russell, who delivers the definitive caricature of a 1930's career gal. And Ralph Bellamy's hamhanded nice guy was so effective that his name became synonymous with that type of role. Amazing that he was ever taken seriously afterwards. The writing is superb, better than most any dialogue you'll hear today. And Howard Hawks directs the whole shebang at just the right pace and tone to keep it all together.  The story is pretty simple. Russell is Grant's ex, and she's come back to see him at the newspaper he edits and she used to write for to inform him that she's getting remarried (to Bellamy) Whew! Meanwhile, Grant decides to win her back at the last minute, sucking her back into the newspaper game by tricking her into covering the last day of a man on death row. Can't tell you what happens, you'll have to watch for yourself.  If this all sounds a bit familiar, but you know you haven't seen it, there were several other filmed versions of the play this was based on, \\\"The Front Page\\\". The Matthau/Lemon version was okay, but avoid the painfully unfunny 80's version, \\\"Switching Channels\\\" with Kathleen Turner and that Superman fella.  Veddy veddy funny. It makea me laugh. 10 out of 10.  \", \"Cary Grant stars in this film. Is there anything else that needs to be said? Grant plays the former husband of newspaper reporter Russell. It is of course a romantic comedy, but one that is hilarious even today. The chemistry and dialogue between Grant and Russell rings genuine. Besides the romance, and the comedy, is the commentary the film makes about newspaper reporting and reporters. The key to this film is listening. This is not a popcorn picture where you can make comments to your viewing companions. If you talk you'll miss half of the jokes. So keep quiet and enjoy. Also Grant makes references to himself in a typically funny scene.\", \"His Girl Friday is one of the rare comic films that is not only hilarious but actually changed how films are made (or at least written). Director Howard Hawks' adaptation of The Front Page was the first time that lines were written specifically to be overlapped and Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell grab hold of those lines and never let go. This film is full speed comedy that never lets up.\", \"This movie is my personal most favorite movie starring Rosalind Russell. Many may choose her \\\"Mame\\\" or \\\"Gypsy\\\" as her very best, but I think for her comedic talent \\\"His Gal Friday\\\" is her very best. Whenever she shared the screen with Cary Grant there was a fast-paced banter that magically makes me cackle. Grant is suave as always and just look at the sharp 40's style suits that Russell is dressed in. Love the hats. Have you ever heard anyone put so many words into a sentence without drawing a breath as when she finally for the umpteenth time tells Walter Burns (Grant) that she's out of the news business while tearing up her last interview? And then, maybe predictably, as the latest news breaks right in front of her, she automatically turns into a relentless news hound! This is a smart movie, it has plenty of plot and character development, it has great strong characters, it makes commentary on the newsbusiness then that is relevant to the newsbusiness today and sarcastically shares the modern view of government I think, as well. This is a classic movie that is perhaps timeless. See it!\", \"Just this morning, as I was flicking absent-mindedly through the television channels, I accidentally clicked my way onto Channel 31 (Australia), which, I hazard to venture, is not generally known for its quality programming. Luckily, my eye was momentarily caught by a young and sharp-looking Cary Grant, and I immediately identified the film to be 1940's 'His Girl Friday,' which I had been meaning to watch for some months. Just like Frank Capra's holiday favourite 'It's A Wonderful Life,' the film has fallen into the public domain, and so television stations are completely free to air it whenever they want. This also means that any company is allowed to throw a poor-quality print onto DVD at practically no cost to them, so this is something to be wary of. Unfortunately, I missed a few minutes of the beginning of the film, but I was too hooked into the story to worry about that until later.  For his remake of the 1931 film 'The Front Page' (which was directed by Lewis Milestone and starred Adolphe Menjou), Howard Hawks took the story \\u0096 complete with all its witty, rapid-fire dialogue \\u0096 and changed the male character of Hildebrand 'Hildy' Johnson to a female \\u0096 Hildegaard 'Hildy' Johnson (Rosalind Russell) \\u0096 and also the ex-wife of the newspaper editor, Walter Burns (Cary Grant). When Hildy expresses her intentions of quitting the newspaper business and marrying Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy) in Albany, Walter takes every precaution possible to prevent her from boarding that train. With a convicted cop-killer, Earl Williams (John Qualen), set to be hanged in the morning, the press-room at the prison is abuzz with vulturous reporters scavenging about for a good story. Rather than simply admitting his continuing love for Hildy, Walter uses the great lengths to which he will go to stop her leaving to tell her how he still feels about her. Also, along the way, Hildy discovers \\u0096 as the night gradually becomes more and more exciting \\u0096 that she is a reporter at heart, and will never be able to rid herself of the desire to uncover that perfect story.  The jokes come thick and fast, with the talented cast delivering the clever dialogue faster than you can register it, barely giving you any time to laugh. Especially in screwball comedies such as these, actor confidence is absolutely essential, and everybody involved here performs admirably. In addition to the entertaining and often-heated banter between Walter and Hildy, other excellent characters include Bruce Baldwin (the unfortunate would-be future husband whose is arrested on no less than three occasions, and whose mother is kidnapped), the bumbling Sheriff Peter B. Hartwell (Gene Lockhart), Walter's sneaky henchman, Diamond Louie (Abner Biberman), the governor's clueless delivery-man, Joe Pettibone (Billy Gilbert) and a long line of newspaper reporters, each of whom witnesses the same event and yet still reports it in a completely different and entirely inaccurate manner.\", \"The kind of work executed in His Girl Friday is no shorter than masterful; it should be a frenzy, a fiasco of dialog going and overlapping and reverberating and the pacing clocking in at ridiculous amounts at times (other times, oddly enough, it slows down just enough for us and the actors to catch respective breath). But Howard Hawks and his screenwriter Charles Lederer have the material down to a T. The film brilliantly interweaves a newspaper story that unfolds over the course of a day and night around a man who's to be (wrongfully) sentenced to death, and a love-triangle played out between Walter (Grant), Hildy (Russell) and Bruce (Bellamy), as Walter can't stand that his ex-wife is not only leaving the paper- which she's wildly amazing at as a writer and reporter- but for Albany insurance man Bruce Baldwin as new husband. He constructs an ingenious lot of tricks, mostly to put Bruce in jail, so that he can play on Hildy's ego to come back to the paper and, maybe, to him too. But it won't be easy.  Hawks overcomes what could have been stagey picture- since it is based on a play, and feels it at times with its main set at the newspaper office- with what is first a true intuition to how to tell the story without getting in the way of a good conversation; sometimes going in three directions! It's not exactly a movie that brings out a whole lot of belly laughs; rather it's the accumulation of just solid chuckles, guffaws, and the occasional fall-on-the-floor moment that hit the best with characterization, behavior, mannerisms, manners. Matter of fact, it's extremely, keenly observed about how every character is who he/she is, and is fairly stuck in their ways, from the headstrong Hildy, the good but flabbergasted Bruce, his old mother, the \\\"I'm innocent!\\\" pleading man on death row, the Sheriff, the Mayor, the bunch of gruff and grizzled and card-playing newspaper men. But everyone's about as close to being, if not incredibly, fully realized, and there's barely a scene where someone doesn't say something, or repeat something, or refer or make some quip that doesn't get a laugh. This is how it's done, basically, in the best \\\"screwball\\\" style.  Even Hildy, who seems to be completely set upon leaving the newspaper biz, isn't without moments of vulnerability that crack through her tough, Hawksian-exterior. And Russell, I should add, comes off a lot of the screen time stealing the show. While Grant is no sleepwalker and puts to work his skills at being charming and amusing while also playing a conniving persona, Russell puts everything she's got into a character that is probably far stronger than Bruce can take and is just about an even match for Walter Burns's double-crossing. Hell, she can even do a dramatic scene here or there, or make it so that she's right on the level with another actor (i.e. the one playing the death-row guy) so that comedy and drama come and go depending on the beat of the scene. It's breathtaking to watch her work, and it's likely her best performance (Grant, too, comes away with much of his screen time).  Just make no mistake, this isn't a comedy that is based on the actors for most of the support. It's a wild combination of the pacing of the story, of the rat-tat-tat-tat style of overlapping and interweaving dialog (the likes of which one might see today on the TV show Gilmore Girls or, more cinematically, Altman) and that it never comes along as too rushed within the suspenseful narrative. And it floored me as being somewhat unique, and it only takes itself so much seriously in the world its set in so that it's always entertaining. If you're tuned into His Girl Friday, Hawks won't bore you for a second, and it's a mighty achievement.\", \"In this second film version of the hit play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur The Front Page, New York newspaper reporter Hildy Johnson (played by Pat O'Brien in 1931) is now a sassy, confident woman (Rosalind Russell). Hildy has had enough of the newspaper life and is going to quit and marry dependable (boring) Bruce Baldwin (never-gets-the-girl Ralph Bellamy) and move to Albany. The thing is, her editor and ex-husband Walter Burns Cary Grant) doesn't want either thing to happen and tricks Hildy into covering just one more story \\u0096 that of a deluded radical charged with murder. What follows is a super-charged side-splitting satire of the headline-hungry newspaper business and of course, a bit of romance.  Howard Hawks directs his stars and a brilliant cast of supporting players (Billy Gilbert, a real scene-stealing stand-out) at a breathless pace, using overlapping dialog to increase the feeling of frenzy. You'll want to watch this one again and again to catch all of the terrific dialog. Some of those witty lines (at least as legend has it) were improvised, such as when Grant describes Bruce Baldwin, saying that he \\\"looks like that film actor, Ralph Bellamy.\\\" Later, during a rapid-fire telephone exchange, Grant responds to another actor's line with \\\"The last person to say that to me was Archibald Leach just before he cut his throat!\\\" (Archibald Leach of course, being Grant's real name.) Named to the National Film Registry in 1993.\", \"*** This review may contain spoilers *** His Girl Friday starts out strong with witty banter exchanged by Cary Grant as Walter Burns and Rosalind Russell as Hildy Johnson. Cary and Rosalind had a lot of chemistry in this film. Walter Burns is a blunt, impatient, controlling, man. I started out with a bit of sympathy for Hildy, who plays a woman who just wants a normal life away from journalism. Both characters turn out to be manipulative,unsympathetic, and very similar. The plot loses steam and is not very interesting, and is full of annoying characters. Everyone seems really corrupt. The movie started off really interesting, but couldn't sustain itself.\", \"Whoever had the bright idea to turn the Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur play, The Front Page into a boy and girl comedy ought to get a Nobel Prize for comedy if such an award had been available at the time.   Of course it helps when one of your two main characters has an ambiguous first name like Hildy. Short for Hildreth when Pat O'Brien plays it, Rosalind Russell is all female in this one. Russell bites off a huge chunk of Katherine Hepburn career woman territory here and she digests it well.   She's the best reporter on the staff of the Morning Post and her editor Cary Grant doesn't want to lose her no way. At one time he even married her, but that didn't take. They're divorced now and Russell is fed up and decides she wants a home and children and security and Ralph Bellamy is going to give her all of that. Plus a home with his mother Alma Kruger for a year in Albany.  As her friendly rival reporter Regis Toomey says, there ain't no way that Russell could ever leave the newspaper game. She proves it when she goes to work on that one last assignment to cover an execution at the state penitentiary.  Even though Howard Hawks did add a romance into The Front Page he did not sacrifice one iota of the biting satire from Hecht and MacArthur. If you watch the either The Front Page or His Girl Friday or even the remake from the eighties Broadcast News you will swear the world is made up of boobs and nitwits and the only smart people around are journalists. Too often however that's proved to be the case.  Poor meek John Qualen who was listening to some radicals speaking and got caught up in the moment and accidentally shot a black police officer. Back then ethnic politics were played to the hilt and a law and order mayor, Clarence Kolb, wants to see Qualen executed. His brother-in-law, sheriff Gene Lockhart means to see the sentence is done.  Cary Grant's paper is against capital punishment at least for this poor schnook. Of course when Qualen escapes all kinds of complication arise and Russell's on the job to report them.  As he was in The Awful Truth, Ralph Bellamy is there to be the slightly befuddled doofus who loses the girl to fast talking Cary. Bellamy's performance is a brilliant piece of work itself. He's so funny because he plays the part absolutely straight and the humor falls around him.  Howard Hawks assembles a really grand cast of memorable character actors. My favorite however, brief though his scenes are is Billy Gilbert who is a messenger from the governor who is delivering a sentence commutation. The poor man gets waylaid and involved in all kinds of intrigue that is all going on over his head. You have to see him to believe how funny he is and he does it without a sneeze.  His Girl Friday successfully combines screwball romantic comedy with biting satire and no seams show it all in the stitching. It's a blueprint on how to do successful cinema comedy.\", \"Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell make great sparring partners in \\\"His Girl Friday,\\\" a remake of \\\"The Front Page.\\\" Grant plays the conniving newspaper publisher Walter Johnson, and Rosalind Russell is the reporter Hildy Johnson, a woman this time, and Johnson's ex-wife. She's trying to get remarried, move to Albany, and quit the newspaper business, but Walter can't bear it. He cons her into helping out with a controversial death row case and then makes sure her fianc\\u00e9e (Ralph Bellamy) suffers a series of mishaps - arrest for stealing a watch, arrest for \\\"mashing,\\\" arrest for counterfeiting, and the theft of his wallet. This all happens while Hildy interviews Earl Williams, a man due to be hung the next day... and then hides him in a roll-top desk in the courthouse press room when he escapes during a psychiatric evaluation.  It's madcap, all right, and there are no two better people to carry it off than Grant and Russell, who make a great team. It's a hilarious story, with the most rapid-fire, non-stop dialog ever heard anywhere, often with several conversations going on at once. It's exhausting trying to keep up with it.  Strangely, without computers and cell phones, the story of journalists working on a story holds up because the emotions and activities are realistic and still go on. It's as Hildy describes - no set schedule, no normal meals, and long hours. Nothing much has changed.  This is a frenetic comedy, and while the impending hanging of Earl Williams is certainly serious, this plot is more of an excuse to observe the machinations of Hildy and Walter - it's a subplot, though it drives the main story.  \\\"The Front Page\\\" is a favorite of Hollywood's, remade many times - three versions under its original title, a TV series, two TV productions, plus the film \\\"Switching Channels.\\\" And of course, \\\"His Girl Friday,\\\" possibly the best of all of them.\", \"\\\"His Gal Friday\\\" is Howard Hawks' tribute to the brilliant play in which this film is based. Charles McGraw and Ben Hecht, two of the best writers of the era, paid tribute to the journalists that wrote for the American newspapers of the thirties. This movie has some of the fastest dialogs in memory.  The incredible combination of Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, and Ralph Bellamy in the main roles is what made this movie a favorite. Mr. Grant as Walter Burns, the unscrupulous newspaper editor, is the perfect foil for Rosalind Russell's, Hildy Johnson, a role that is played by a male in the original play and in the other film versions.  The best moment of the film is the moment when Cary Grant speaking so fast, that some what he says goes over the viewer's heads, refers as to Ralph Bellamy by name as not having a chance and cites in the same breadth his real name Archibald Leach.   It's hard to imagine anyone but Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell playing Walter and Hildy. Ralph Bellamy is perfect as Hildy's fianc\\u00e9, Bruce Baldwin. Gene Lockhart is perfect as the sheriff Pinky Hartwell. The ensemble of actors that play the reporters following the possible execution of Earl Williams, are perfect.  An excellent comedy thanks to the genius of Howard Hawks.\", \"As if creating one comedic masterpiece with 1938's BRINGING UP BABY was not enough, director Howard Hawks returned to the same genre a scant two years later - and he somehow managed to rival even his own previous masterwork. Nominally a reworking Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's play THE FRONT PAGE, HIS GIRL Friday manages to surpass it's classic source material and emerge as one of the screen's finest comedies. The film is also perhaps the perfect example of Hawks' trademarked rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue, which has never been as fast nor as furious anywhere else before or since. This is certainly one of the fastest moving comedies ever filmed, and the whole cast never misses a beat.  Walter Burns, the conniving, self-serving newspaper editor, is a character that could have easily come off as a tyrannical jerk. As portrayed by the suave Cary Grant, however, the pompous, arrogant Burns actually becomes (gasp!) likable! It is a difficult balancing act that Grant must perform as teetering between the two extremes of the character, and he is arguably the only actor imaginable with the skill and charisma to pull such a tricky characterization off this successfully. And the one-and-only Rosalind Russell is every bit his match - full of verve and aplomb, Russell's Hildy is an independent career woman, brimming with intelligence and class, that impressively pre-dates the major feminist movement of the mid-sixties by a good 25 years.  The film's supporting cast is no less impressive, with every single role cast to perfection. This is particularly true of Ralph Bellamy, who (along with his Oscar-nominated performance in 1937's THE AWFUL TRUTH) proves once again that he is the ultimate straight man. The film contains some grim subject matter that may seem like unlikely fodder for a screwball comedy (murder, attempted suicide, and public execution are all touched upon), although the film somehow manages to deal with such topics respectfully and without sacrificing any laughs. In the end, HIS GIRL Friday is an absolutely unbeatable romantic comedy that remains wildly hilarious and comes as close to sheer perfection as any motion picture could ever hope to.\", \"If BRINGING UP BABY has rapid-fire dialogue and one crazy scene after the other, HIS GIRL Friday goes even faster and is 10 minutes shorter. A story not that un-similar to THE PHILADELPHIA STORY which deletes the scatterbrained socialites in favor for a gritty, urban setting, Cary Grant is fantastic in his role as Walter Burns as he tries to win back his wife Hildy Johnson (an equally brilliant Rosalind Russell in full comic mode) by literally throwing her back into what she -- deep down -- loves best: reporting and the breakneck lifestyle that comes with being in front of the news. These two are on camera often, and their dialogue together is like a frenzied waltz: trying to follow every exact word, gesture, and snarl is quite a task, boy, does it sizzle! What a shame that this wasn't up for any awards, as this could have easily won in acting categories. Completely ahead of its times, this is an interesting view on feminism thirty years before the term became public knowledge, and if one listens closely, a study in verbal sexual interplay. Which shows that making Hildy Johnson a woman was the best decision a director could ever do to enhance a story.  A remake of an earlier film (THE FRONT PAGE, 1931), itself a film version of a 1928 play, HIS GIRL Friday was remade again as THE FRONT PAGE in 1976 and yet again in 1988 as SWITCHING CHANNELS, with Kathleen Turner nicely holding up in her portrayal of the role that cemented Rosalind Russell as a skilled comedienne, this time set in media TV.\", \"This gloriously funny romp by Howard Hawks is rightly remembered as one of the fastest-talking movies ever made. Originally done as 'The Front Page', the play by Hecht and McArthur takes on new life here as the character of Hildy Johnson metamorphoses in this version to be a sparky woman (played by Rosalind Russell), former wife of the harassed columnist Walter Burns (played with characteristic bewilderment and charm by Cary Grant). Hildy is about to marry again, to the nice but dull Bruce Baldwin (played by Ralph Bellamy as a character so boring he 'is like Ralph Bellamy' - how Hollywood liked its in-jokes).  With that fire-cracking script, a sizable amount of sparks between Grant and Russell, and good support from Bellamy and a cast which includes Gene Lockhart, Cliff Edwards, Clarence Kolb, and Regis Toomey, 'His Girl Friday' is one of those classic gems which never age and which remain hugely entertaining.\", \"Every good thing you've heard about this movie is true. It may very well be the fastest paced movie I've ever seen. Jerry Bruckheimer's most hyperbolic action movie ain't got nothing' on this one.  Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell were a brilliant screen pair (indeed, it seems that no one was bad casting when paired with Cary Grant) as rival reporters in a furiously paced news office. Russell is the odd man, or should I say odd girl, out, due to her lack of a penis, but she proves herself more than capable of holding her own with the boys.  Russell charges across the screen and never loses momentum for a second. She's goofy, sexy and hysterical. The funniest moment in the film comes when she's chasing a man down the street (I won't go into details) and dive tackles him to the ground.  One of the first films from the 40s and a highlight of the decade.  Grade: A+\", \"Charles McArthur and Ben Hecht met when both were reporters in Chicago during the 1920s. They created two of the funniest farces in American drama, TWENTIETH CENTURY (about theater people) and THE FRONT PAGE. The latter was based on their experiences as news reporters in those crazy days in Chicago, where the newspapers concentrated on sensationalism and the politics was thoroughly corrupt. The resulting play is hysterically funny and yet remains timely. For all the exaggeration of how Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson manipulate police, politicians, reporters, and civilians to get their scoop, the story remains relevant for several reasons. The political balance in a big Mayoralty election is precarious due to the Earl Williams case. Williams has shot a policeman who is African-American, a big local voting block, and they want him punished. The corrupt Mayor and his idiot jail warden are willing to execute him for the votes needed to stay in office, but the Governor (who is from the rival party) believes the killer is insane (or at least mentally deficient). So already (as you see) race, politics, and the validity of the death penalty get pulled in. Soon we also see examples of nepotism and corruption in the police, and City Hall, cynical politics based on a man's life, and questions about privacy and a free press. For a play from 1931 this one still has relevance.  There had been an earlier version of the play in the 1930s called THE FRONT PAGE, starring Adolphe Menjou as the conniving and devious Walter Burns, and Pat O'Brien as ace reporter Hildy Johnson. It is a good version, and both stars do well with their parts (and both have the verbal speed necessary for the dialog to flow over the ears of the audience). But when the film was remade in 1940, Howard Hawks decided to redraw Hildy Johnson into a female reporter (and previous wife) of Burns. His casting of Cary Grant was radically different too. Burns is a nasty, conniving s.o.b. who would kill for a good story. Menjou was somewhat dapper (he was usually dapper) in the role, but the hardness under the presentable shell was there. And by changing Hildy from a guy to a gal, and Walter's former wife, you had to make Walter look more interesting. So Walter is turned into Cary Grant. There was a search for Hildy, involving Jean Arthur and Irene Dunne as possibilities. Neither ended up playing him. Instead it went to Rosalind Russell.  It has to be admitted Russell had the vocal abilities to push the dialog at the proper clip. Possibly Jean Arthur could have done that just as well, but Arthur did not have the apparent physical strength behind the stylishness that Russell showed. She really does balance well (in this film) with Grant, given their characters.  Motivation changes a little. This Walter Burns still wants to get his scoops, but there are moments of fragility when he realizes he may forever lose Hildy to her fianc\\u00e9 Bruce (the ever helpless Ralph Bellamy). And they oddly work (Hawks manages to keep them under control). Also, as the story is now twelve years older than the original play, certain changes occur in Walter's political views. He does dislike the gang (led by Clarence Kolb and Gene Lockhart) running the city, and points out to Hildy that they have a chance to help give the city the sort of government New York City has under La Guardia. This does not end his joy at scooping the opposition, but it does suggest that Burns has more depth.  It is now generally believed that this is the best of the film versions of THE FRONT PAGE, and one of the funniest films ever made. The entire cast shines (look at the scene where Helen Mack confronts the reporters who have made her look like a tramp, and have told lies about John Qualen (Williams) - she is in a state when Russell takes her out of the press room, and the reporters are thoroughly ashamed of herself - and Russell comes back looking at Regis Toomey, Porter Hall, and the others, and says \\\"Gentlemen of the Press!\\\" with heavy cynical irony). And also note Billy Gilbert's immortal Joe Pettibone, the most hopeless monument of total befuddlement in movies. It is one of the few film comedies of that period that retains it's laughs one viewing following another.\", \"I just finished watching the DVD of this first-class, semi-Screwball comedy in Columbia Classics beautiful transfer, and it absolutely made my day! What a movie! What a screenplay! The dialogue is better - more modern - in fact, than a in lot of contemporary movies. It's incredibly funny, too, and my teenage sons kept laughing right along with me at the smart come-backs. Cary Grant is, of course, as good (if not better) than ever, and I've never seen Rosalind Russel in a role that suited her more perfectly. And that's just for starters: The timing of the thing is still awe- inspiring after sixty-odd years; the supporting actors, down to the bit-players, are all memorable, convincing and hilarious; the camera work (this IS the forties, though) is inventive and the editing superb. I can safely confess now that I hadn't ever seen it before, but that's no reason for you to make the same mistake: Go buy/rent it NOW! Hats off to the great Howard Hawks, his cast and crew for pulling this comedy masterpiece off. And thank you, thank you, thank you Columbia Pictures, for  making it possible for me to watch it in such pristine condition!

Director Howard Hawks wanted to show the whirlwind pace of the newsroom in the criminal courts system so he had his actors overlap their lines -- so much so that at times it seems as though everyone is talking at once; it even gets difficult to understand all that is going on.  He also had the cast move FAST so the film looks totally frenetic from scene to scene with no respite -- either from the laughs or from the action.  There are two really good \\\"inside\\\" jokes in the script: The first is where Walter Burns (Grant) is describing Hildy's fiancee and says that \\\"he looks like that guy in the movies -- Bellamy,\\\" Well, it WAS Ralph Bellamy playing that part!  The other is when Burns says something about someone he once knew named \\\"Archie Leach\\\" which just happens to be Cary Grant's real name.  This is one of the true gems of Hollywood's most prolific era. It has incredible pacing, acting, photography and an authentic gritty feeling that would be associated with hard-boiled, \\\"anything for a story\\\" newspaper people.

Although joining a gang and seeing his sister behave as a slut, must have made impressions, we just can't quite ring out what the boy is really thinking.  Over all a well filmed series of nicely acted pieces, but hardly a winner of an Academy.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"House of 1000 Corpses\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0251736\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"I will not waste words on plot spoilers or a quick summary. Put simply this movie scared the living crap out of me (heheheh)and I loved every minute of it. If one loves horror such as myself and loves the adrenaline a scary movie arises in oneself \\\"House of 1000 Corpses\\\" evoked just that. I waited so long for The Devils Rejects only to realize they took a totally different spin on the genre. Instead of scaring us to death, director Rob Zombie tried to get the audience to empathize with the serials, which the script accomplished perfectly, however lacking the absolute fear the first movie \\\"1000 Corpses\\\" evoked. Watch it because although in time the movie is considered cheesy it was what I call a horror movie! Had me literally on the edge of my couch right until the final scene!!!\", \"In the early to mid 90s horror wasn't exactly dead, but it was a time when our beloved genre wasn't as big a thing as it was in times such as the 40s and 60s-80s. Then came 'Scream,' a horror film that both payed tribute to and poked fun at the slasher film. Now I for one love the film, as well as it's two sequels, but like with 'Halloween,' this movie was followed by a series of clones, a lot of which were not met with a lot of praise from hardcore horror fans, myself included. Horror was hot again, but it looked like history was about to repeat itself. Then the 21st century came and a new era of horror was about to begin. Is this film from first time director Rob Zombie a contributor?   Pros: There are quite a few good things to be found, but I feel the film's greatest asset is the impressive set design. First time director Zombie makes the film a nice piece of eye candy with plenty colorful lights, filters, black and white photography, striking imagery, split screens, etc. Some very funny dialogue. Great cast of veterans and fresh faces who each give a good performance. Moves at a good clip. Not much gore, but there's plenty of the red stuff. The villains are all memorable and very mean and nasty instead of lovable like say Freddy Krueger became. Good make-up effects. A pretty good score and some great rock tunes from the likes of the Ramones and even Rob Zombie himself. Some neat homages to 70s exploitation films and old monster movies.  Cons: If it's originality you're looking for, you won't find much of that here. None of the good guys really stand out, so it's hard to pick someone to root for. The plot does wear kind of thin.  Final thoughts: After so many Scream-like flicks, this nasty little gem came along to blow them away. I don't know if I can say this film is the one responsible for the way horror is now, but at least it helped a lot. It took a while for this movie to get released, but it was well worth the wait.  My rating: 4/5\", \"Probably the most grotesque thing that happened during this bloodbath was the voice of Frank Ifield singing I remember you-a hit song from 1962 which topped the charts and went onto score in the States on the same label which issued the Beatles before Capitol Records came to their senses. It seems totally out of place here as this isn't your usual American Graffiti type of movie! It is in fact a movie which would have been called a Video Nasty at one time and caters to the demand for Extreme Horror.And since the 70s Horror is in demand more than ever especially the kind about mad doctors who get struck off the register for conducting live autopsies! The only thing missing was David Parker Ray-I mean this wasn't fiction it really happens every other month -try reading Sadistic Killers. It delivers just what it says on the box-but you need to have some experience before you delve into it. Wide open for a sequel but somehow I couldn't see 1000 corpses.The title would have been better to just Corpses its something of a mouthful and sounds like one of those 50s horror flicks of the Night of the Flesh Eating Zombies type. As for a storyline its not of prime importance.People kill people is all you need to know\", \"\\\"House of 1000 Corpses\\\" by Rob Zombie is a great horror/comedy film, thought so the day I saw it in the movie theater. Please don't argue the moot point that it's a remake of \\\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\\" and therefore unoriginal... us horror aficionados realize it's a homage to cheesy 70s horror films and borrows heavily from many horror/slasher films from the past 30 years. It's still damn good and fine piece of film-making. To leave the audience with such a lasting impression of your main character that they remember your villain after the movie ends is a great feat... to make such an impression that the audience breathes life into that character every Halloween and costumed convention is amazing. Zombie did the latter with EVERY character in \\\"House\\\" which is almost unheard of... just say the names and you can picture the face: Otis, Baby, Captain Spaulding, Tiny, Mother Firefly, Dr. Satan, Grandpa, RJ... even Goober (\\\"that's G. Ober\\\"). Not as technically good as \\\"Devil's Rejects\\\" but truly a horror classic. If you think otherwise and want to discuss it with me, buy me a drink and get ready for the long haul.\", \"You would think by now that those young people would stay the hell off the back roads in Texas. I've traveled them North to South and East to West, and I can assure you that there are things you don't want to see.  I don't remember The Devil's Rejects as being as good as this film. Ron Zombie presented a visual and auditory assault on the senses that moved right along and featured an outstanding soundtrack and some of the best special effects I have seen in a horror movie about a family since those rejects in Judge Dredd.  Sid Haig was a real hoot as Captain Spaulding. He really added to the movie. Of course, Sheri Moon was fantastic as Baby Firefly.  I just can't wait for Halloween.\", \"I have a certain respect for Rob Zombie. His love of the classic cult grind-house horror of yesteryear is very endearing and I believe him to have a certain integrity rare amongst film personalities. Unfortunately House of 1000 Corpses, while certainly expressing Zombie's love for old school shock horror, is simply too convoluted, elaborate and often boring to send a single shiver up the spine.  It is obvious that painstaking care was taken in the aesthetics of the film but unfortunately it has failed. For the most part the film looks as if the lighting and makeup designers had just come from a job on The Bold and the Beautiful with gaudy colours and super smooth skin on characters who have supposedly been on the road for days detracting greatly from any attempts at a gritty atmosphere. Even in the supposed house of 1000 corpses the production design resembles a piece of theatre more than a disturbing pit of hell and mayhem. I understand the burlesque inspiration here but even with that considered the sets shouldn't look so staged. The special effects makeup also looked more like paper mache than deformed skin, apart from Dr. Satan, who does look very effective but is unfortunately severely underused.  The acting for the most part is excruciating. Sid Haig is fun as always and completely steals the show but apart from him there is not a single character here who the audience will feel strongly for or against simply because they are all 1 dimensional stock standards played in the fashion of a high school drama class. One very disappointing aspect of the performances is that the older members of the sicko family are obviously played by college age kids and the poor makeup and acting is unable to hide this. The dialogue is obviously aiming to be quotable, and is therefore so ludicrously overwritten that it does little but add to the amateur theatricality of the film.  By the time we get to the juicy horror stuff the film takes the action in a completely convoluted direction until the audience no longer cares what this sick family is hiding or what kind of back story there may be. Simplicity is the key stroke to the art of the horror film but obviously Rob Zombie wanted to do away with that trend in House of 1000 Corpses. The same can be said of the cinematography. Negative colourization and crash cuts to grainy newsreel style footage of what is happening in another room are amateur tricks at best and more at home in an MTV music clip. To add insult to injury these tricks are overused to the point of exhaustion.  I watched this film with a friend who I consider a kindred spirit in horror fandom and we both are well watched and researched on the genre. I'm sad to say that half way through House of 1000 Corpses our silence could no longer be held and my friend finally had to open the floodgates with \\\"Ugh, this is so bad!\\\" Yes, it is. Kudos to your vision Mr. Zombie, but your execution is in dire need of tuning.\", \"First off, all of you that gave this movie a bad review - You probably just don't understand it.  And to all of you that haven't seen it but is checking out some reviews before you decide to buy it or download it - You're in for a hell of a ride. As we all know, Rob is very much into vintage horror and having SO much to look at that it almost becomes unwatchable. He made it, it's a true masterpiece! If you're into vintage horror and just love gore - this is a movie for you! The story is simple, classic and great, it's basically the usual - some kids on a road trip doing whatever, end up in hell. Although he added some genius twists here and there. The acting is great, but you have to understand the parts to notice that. Sheri Moon's part requires the kind of acting that either is awful or awesome - she really pulls it of! The rest of the acting is just brilliant.  So watch this movie. It's sick, grotesque, beautiful and just brilliant. Rob really know what he's doing!\", \"...And it's not because of the B-grade gore!  First of all I need to address the fact that a lot of people are comparing this movie to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, saying that it's essentially a remake.  I just watched it and it probably feels that way because the entire movie is just a pastiche of cult horror... All I can say is that I REALLY HOPE that The Devil's Rejects is better than this, because this movie probably ranks amongst the 10 worst movies I have ever seen (and don't worry, it isn't worse than The Abyss). Reading a review of the movie here claiming that anyone who doesn't like this movie \\\"just doesn't get it\\\" and was probably looking for more artsy-fartsy films and [ insert pretentious/derogatory comment here ] really made me feel ill; people are ACTUALLY comparing this movie with greats such as Suspiria and The Dead series?! If you rank this movie with those movies there's nothing wrong with the guy questioning the legitimacy of your rankings... but there's definitely something wrong with YOU!  The movie doesn't start out all that bad and has a kind of wacky, goofball-horror that sort of works. Anyone who doesn't either laugh or groan at the moniker of DR. Satan (muahahahahahahahaha *lightningbolts*) has probably never watched B-grade horror or can't appreciate unintentional comedy (and this movie is hopefully not both). When the hook of the movie starts the whole movie begins to plummet into a sea of bad ideas and impulsive directing. The only thing I really like about the movie is the stylized americana feel... it's kind of cozy in a way.  All in all this movie is yet another movie of the times, yet don't dismiss it because of the violence; dismiss it because it just isn't that good! Unlike the Saw movies that are ridiculous beyond belief with bad scripts, goofy traps and twists made to make you feel intellectually inferior to the writers this movie is actually all about shock and gore and good ol' fashioned fun at which... it fails. Regardless of how you rationalize it no amount of gore, camp or references to your old faves in the horror genre can save a movie with over-the-top acting, a weak script and uninspired directing.   I hold no prejudice towards anyone who likes this movie. By all means, revel in the gore if you so wish! Because when the day is done that is why you watch this movie. Some might call it a study in misanthropy... I just call it an 89 minute waste of life.\", \"I love Rob Zombie's music and was looking forward to this movie when I first heard about it. From the recurring themes in his music, I thought it would be a bit like Evil Dead II: surreal, funny, supernatural, and purposefully cheesy. Instead, I got 90 minutes of torture porn. Zombie makes no attempt to build any kind of suspense or generate any kind of terror. Rather, he focuses in excruciating detail on the process of abducting, torturing, and killing four unlucky teenagers. Watching what could be Charlie Manson's home videos is an unnerving, disturbing, disgusting experience; the teens are trapped in a house of killers, hopeless, beaten, despairing, with only the knowledge of their imminent torture and death for company. It's an excruciating experience that left me feeling dirty and thinking about all the people who really have died at the sadistic hands of very real serial killers. All in all it's an example of what not to do in a horror movie.\", \"(Second Review.)   \\\"My brain is frozen!\\\" Otis Driftwood (Bill Moseley) yells at a trio of bound-and-gagged cheerleaders at one point, and I felt the same way. Even on second glance, \\\"House of 1,000 Corpses\\\" is awful, simply because form and narrative is jettisoned for a near-endless string of abrasively avant-garde camera techniques (loud color filters, cut scenes that come out of nowhere, aged-down video quality, negative filters, split screen, etc.) chosen because...well, \\\"they look cool,\\\" I guess. They certainly don't augment any narrative purpose with their constant assault, and this makes sense, given Rob Zombie's previous background in music-video direction.  The story itself is a muddled mess. There are at least 3 separate plots going on, none of which are given sufficient attention. The scene is set when a carload of grating college students (including former \\\"Singled Out\\\" host Chris Hardwick and \\\"The Office\\\"'s Rainn Wilson), writing a book on weird roadside attractions, run afoul of Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig\\u0096\\\"Spider Baby\\\"), the flour-faced clown proprietor of a combination gas station/fried chicken stand/Murder Ride. Said students learn of the local legend of Dr. Satan, but get sidetracked by obnoxious hitchhiker Baby (Sheri Moon, Zombie's wife), who brings our zeroes home for a night of torture, terror, and totally gross overacting by her kin, the Fireflies. But what of the aforementioned cheerleaders, who are made out to be a plot point? And why do we spend most of the movie with the grating Fireflies when the Dr. Satan thread would have made a far more interesting film?   Who knows, who cares. While Zombie may have never read about postmodernism in film, \\\"Corpses\\\" fits the criteria to a T\\u0096this is a fanboy movie that wears its '70s influence on its sleeve (going so far as to set the movie on October 30 and 31, and making blatant the socio-economic commentary that Tobe Hooper's infinitely superior \\\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\\" smoothly implied). The Firefly family is yet another riff on the inbred sickos of Hooper's seminal masterpiece crossed with the mountain loonies of \\\"The Hills Have Eyes\\\"\\u0096but whereas the characters in those films gave naturalistic performances (that made them seem all the more real), Zombie writes dialog like an invitation for histrionics from his C-listers; Moseley spends most of the film screaming his lines; Moon's helium-inflected voice is irritating; and Karen Black's over-the-hill slut routine is embarrassing. Haig emerges relatively unscathed, as his presence is reduced to a handful of scenes. And the less said about our wayward heroes, the better. Zombie doesn't present any characters worth caring about, and his penchant for third-grader gross-out gags induces more groans than guffaws.  But above all, \\\"Corpses\\\" fails in the department it was most heralded in: a throwback to gritty, 1970s horror. The aforementioned overzealousness of the director is so unnatural that the viewer is constantly being reminded of the film's modernity as it pulls out all the tricks in the book. More than anything, it feels like a renegade from the direct-to-video bin, where it should have gone in the first place.  That being said, \\\"Corpses\\\" did invoke a consistent feeling of unease in my gut, and I thought the story threads introduced could have yielded an entertaining (and '70s-faithful) finished product if handled with any bit of seriousness. And the last 15 minutes are easily the best in the film\\u0096taking place in dark catacombs with zombies and a red-tinged S&M club for lobotomy patients is very well-done, as it is the only time Zombie reins in all his camera tricks and focuses on atmosphere and suspense. Too bad the same can't be said for the rest of this bloody mess.\", \"I don't see what everybody's beef is with this flick. I actually found it to be extremely entertaining. For Rob Zombie's directorial debut, it was excellent. A lot of blood, a lot of gore, really messed up stuff, great story and the characters were just superb. I urge people to see this one if they are a fan of the horror genre. There was not a moment in the movie that I felt bored. It was constant killing after killing. A completely original horror movie from someone who's brand new to the directing scene. This made me want to see the new Halloween remake, and I was absolutely stunned by it's greatness as well. I don't know what's up with all the low scores! But that's just my opinion.\", \"Rob Zombie's theatrical directing debut \\\"House of 1000 Corpses\\\" has often been sold as wacky horror comedy. But it's everything else than that.  Zombie does a good job with making the viewer feel save in the first half of the movie. The first scene could have been right out of \\\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\\" or one of its countless rip-offs: Two people having a funny conversation and it all ends in a blood bath. Been there, done that more than once. Then your typical teen-horror characters get introduced. All of them more annoying than likable. And so the movie goes on and you are pretty sure that nothing too interesting will happen anymore. WRONG! Suddenly Rob Zombie shifts gear and what started as an average teenie-slasher, becomes a twisted and frightening piece of unexpected terror. And I mean REALLY unexpected, not just \\\"creative killings\\\". You can't tell what happens next, especially not in the last act.  Many viewers have complained about the \\\"Video clip style\\\" of the movie. Well, I can see that it might be annoying for some viewers, but it also adds a surreal quality to the movie. The whole thing looks and feels like a nightmare! Colours change from normal to screaming, people say things that don't make any sense, you see crazy pictures, everything you might have witnessed in a dream is in that movie! Seriously, this is an underrated piece of horror film. At one side just being an update of gritty horror movies like \\\"Texas Chain Saw Massacre\\\", on the other side something completely original. At first sight it looks like a complete mess, but it's a well calculated kick in the stomach!\", \"This was one of the best horror movies that I've seen in a long time. For a first time producer in Rob Zombie, to make a film like this is just amazing. This movie was banned from theaters in the US, but still got a huge buzz and became an instant horror classic. This movie provides everything you want in a horror movie, but i will not give away any details but Rob Zombie does a great job in bringing the horror movie back to its roots. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat or your head tucked in your shirt through out the whole movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror movies and a lot of gore. Once you see this movie go check out the sequel: The Devil's Rejects (Also a great movie).\", \"I have to admit that when I was sitting down to watch this last night, I was skeptical. While I was never a fan of director Rob Zombie's brand of music, I did hold out hopes that his penchant for the depraved would translate into at least a B grade horror flick. I was wrong. What ensued was something that was perhaps as tasteful and visually presentable as a Rainn Wilson-fish. Now, in defense of the film, it set out its goal of being deliciously trashy (at least I hope that was the goal), but I found that after about 20 minutes, the poor acting stopped being funny, the porno-grade directing was beyond laughable, and the movie was not in the slightest bit interesting. I'm no movie snob, but this movie was much worse than my already low expectations. I was expecting a movie with no substance, lots of gore, poor acting, highly suspect character choices (you're driving away from a house full of crazy people! Why the hell would you get out of the car?!), and most importantly, plenty of startling moments that would make me jump out of my seat. This movie unfortunately contained far too much of the former, and not nearly enough of the latter. If you ever find yourself holding a copy of this at blockbuster, put it down and go rent some porn. You'll find a movie with higher production values, better direction and twice the plot.\", \"This is one of the worst new horror movies I've ever seen. Okay, there are a lot of bad new horror movies out there (the prequels to the prequels of famous 70's or 80's horror classics), but these is really far from the worse. I can't understand who is actually letting Rob Zombie (a rock singer or whatever he is) to direct this piece of crap, because he is even worse horror movie director than famous \\\"Ed Wood\\\". Even more, Plan 9 from Outer Space is a brilliant classic comparing to this amateur horror movie.  The plot: two guys and two girls are searching for the clues for the local legend Dr. Satan. After that they found a house of the disturbing family, full of serial killers. The story is \\\"copy - paste\\\" of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Nothing more than that. That proves that Rob Zombie is talentless idiot, who is stealing everything from the classic horror movies. There is nothing original in this movie so I am quite angry to see how some people can afford to direct movies with nothing to show in it, just a bunch of washed up ideas. But there is a lot of people out there, who are having a fresh ideas, but they can't show it to the world because they don't have the connections in Hollywood or entertainment industry.  The main villain is named Dr. Satan. How long did Rob Zombie need to came up with so predictable and unoriginal name like Dr. Satan? The violence in the movie is silly and boring. You have a feeling like Zombie is filling us with violence because he doesn't have no idea how to develop a story. The acting is horrible and so bad even for the lowest \\\"B\\\" movies. Hell... even Sarah Michelle Gellars acted better in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER movies. The script is really bad written, like it was written by 5 - year old kid, who thinks that Sleeping Beauty is a horror story. The dialogs and humor is even worse, jokes are bad, primitive and without any sense. The music is okay, but for that I rather go to the concert than watching this piece of untalented crap movie.  House of 1000 corpses is a good sample of the fact, that you can be whatever you want (despite of not having good ideas), as long you're having a good connections in the entertainment industry. Rob Zombie doesn't have nothing to say: he's just copying stuff from the other movies and deliver them to his fans. That's insulting.  P.S.: There is no spoilers in my comment, because I was watching this movie for about 15. minutes.\", \"\\u00b7 Four young adults go on a road trip to document quirky roadside attractions and stumble across Captain Spaulding's Museum of Monsters and Madmen, which includes a murder ride indexing famous murderers\\u00b7 One of the attractions featured in the murder ride features a local Texas legend, Dr. Satan, who was accused of performing horrendous experiments on his patients at the Weeping Willows Mental Hospital\\u00b7  Captain Spaulding's horror ride piques the foursome's interest in Dr. Satan.

But House and the follow up, The Devil's Rejects will eventually come to be admired as quality horror film contributions **********Ten out of ten stars\", \"You know this is one of those movies that I went into with hateful expectations and did my best to make sure that's exactly what I got. I was critiquing it from the start, and even at the most random things. Now, I apologies. \\\"House Of 1000 Corpses\\\" may not seem original, but it is to an extent. Like I really appreciate it's humor, and retro-aspect, and characters, who yes at times may seem faceless, but they've got more of a pulse than the people in most horror films like this. Sure it may seem a little too \\\"Texas Chainsaw\\\" at times, but hey if you liked \\\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\\", like me, than you shouldn't have a problem with it. I mean it's not like the family were cannibals, or had a member named feather-face who carried a driller :-P Anyways about the movie. The Ups: It's very entertaining, and I must say very thrilling. In fact this is a creepy movie by how real it is. Okay realism is something I truly look for in a horror film(along with characters and story structure), because it seems to me that if a horror film(of any kind) can in some way be portrayed very realistic to even a not so realistic situation than it has more potential to scare people like me. Personally if a horror film can be real enough to where it's scary by, not only how it can really happen, but by the fact that it DOES happen. This movie succeeds in scaring us that way, if you truly put yourself in these characters position you will feel that feeling of fear, anxiety, and hopelessness. The characters are fun, and even though they've been done a million times, you still like them, plus they're very real. Like I love these arn't kids that look like they'd be on a photo spread advertising American Eagle, they look like normal people, which makes it more real and scarier. Sure they may be dull and/or annoying at times, but it's only a few times, as opposed to the whole movie. The downs: Although the retro-aspect is fun, cool, and refreshing, it does become a bit too much at times, and becomes over done and in result becomes self-indulgent. Speaking of which a lot of stuff didn't really fit the atmosphere or realism of the film, plus some things(such as the buried alive thing) didn't really call for what they were doing to the scene, and all in all around the last 20 minutes kind of transcended into a very realistic horror film to almost a monster film. However \\\"House of 1000 Corpses\\\" is one of the better horror films of the decade, and should really be viewed by only horror fans, otherwise normal moviegoers, probably won't dig the films violent, retro, and horror themes.\", \"A piece of pure schlock to say the very least. The basic \\\"story\\\", if you can call it that, is pretty much a ripoff from the far better and much more intense \\\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\\" from the 1970's. This Zombie (Rob) film is nothing more than a feeble attempt to shock you into numbness, as is shown with most of the victims in this story. Dr. Satan? He or \\\"it\\\" appears more as some kind of alien creature or maybe an actual demon from the underworld. And there is no real attempt to explain or define what the motivation for all this butchery is. It just happens, one after another. It also leaves nothing to your imagination so that you dredge up in your mind what's happening as in the original \\\"Texas Chainsaw.\\\" In this flop everything is right out there in the open, distorted camera shots as they may be. A waste of time. Avoid it like the plague!\", \"One thing, i'm sure about, that there was another policeman who didn't die yet, (the one with the white barb). But why he doesn't worried about his partners (or his friend/ father of the victim) who obviously never showed up again ???? Or maybe looking for a help ??? (I always hopping that in the middle of the film, there were a S.W.A.T team who came from no where) I always like a horror/gore movies, but i like betters ones with some logic behind it. I think Rob Zombie miss about this one. We can only suppose that, Mr Policeman is a member of this freak family, or he doesn't really care about his partners, or maybe he's got sick and die ...  Rob Zombie shame on you :p\", \"****possible spoilers******   The movie spends an absurd amount of time establishing a boring and pointless backstory about some Dr Satan nonsense. You'll probably be so bored after awhile you'll be begging for the psycho hick family to start the killing already.  The gore is so over the top, it comes across as laughable. The four main characters, a couple of kids lost in the middle of nowhere, are irritating, have no depth whatsoever, and are just there to die. There's really no one to sympathize with or care about, at all. The situations aren't believable, and there's absolutely no suspension of disbelief. For example, you'd have to be retarded to think two cops and a bunch of kids would go missing, and thousands of state police officers and possibly even national guard wouldn't have descended on the place. It's all highly predictable. And the cinematography is lousy ADHD MTV drivel.   Something like that fishboy scene might have been disturbing...if the characters were anything more than cardboard cutouts.   The villains from the psycho family have such horrendously bad makeup and one liners that they come across as funny more than anything. Their motivations are never established. They pretty much are insane and kill for no reason. Again, more cardboard cutout characters.   You'd have to be high on something to think this was a good movie.   Rob Zombie wanted to make a tribute to slasher films of 70s, but he contributed nothing to the horror genre himself. I actually found it pretty boring overall. You should never be bored during a horror film.  I borrowed this from a friend because I was curious. Sure, I didn't spend any money to see it, but that's still a few hours of my life I will never get back.\", \"This is clearly one of the dumbest films I 've ever seen and surely the dumbest I've seen this year and that's only because I haven't seen any Uwe Boll disaster so far this year. I'm pretty sure a real zombie would have made a better movie than Rod Zombie did. The story is completely laughable, the characters...well...what characters, there's no suspense and there are only lame shocks and so on. With the exception of the make-up FX everything else was just uninteresting and unbelievably boring and annoying. By the way, I'm sorry for Karen Black for having to make films like this to make a living. And to the director of this abomination I can only say: Welcome in Uwe Boll territory, Mr. Zombie.\", \"House Of 1000 Corpses (2003)  This movie was awesome! To tell you, I have never, ever seen anything on the big screen quite like this before. House of 1000 Corpses is a throwback to old school horror movies such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but succeeds much more. It is about four friends who are driving cross country and are returning home after a long trip. Late on Halloween eve, they stop by a sleazy gas station and next to it is \\\"The Museum Of Monsters And Madmen\\\", owned by Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig). Interested and curious, they check it out and end up riding a \\\"murder ride\\\" inside the museum, learning a bit more about a local legend, Dr. Satan. They then head for the road and pick up a strange hitchiker, Baby (Sheri Moon). Their car then breaks down and Baby takes them to her house, not far up the road. They then are pulled into a world of torture and violence, as they are captured by a family of insane lunatics who want them dead.  I have to say, congrats to Mr. Zombie! He has created a horror masterpiece that may become a historical landmark in film history such as others have done before. Zombie's directing debut is wonderful, and had some uniqe and unusual touches to make the film that much more bizarre and spooky, such as the split screen effect, I mean I haven't seen that used since the movie Carrie! The movie also had strange flashbacks and flashforwards. I recommend this movie to any horror fan! You won't be disappointed! I'm surprised it took 3 years to get a company to buy this movie! I can't believe Universal turned it down! I give House of 1000 Corpses a 10/10.\", \"**Spoilers**  I saw this movie yesterday, I don't really know much about Rob Zombie, I don't listen to his kind of music. I'm not a big splatter fan, but I did like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and other horror films, so I thought I would give this one a chance.  I actually liked it at first, it was kind of scary and bizarre enough, but it just became more and more sickening, the evil family in this movie was just absolutely disgusting, which wouldn't have been so bad, but they are almost treated as the heroes of the movie, I get the feeling that Rob Zombie doesn't find their behavior all that reprehensible.  One thing that happened was just to ridiculous, there were 5 local cheerleaders that went missing that keep getting mentioned in the movie, and when one is discovered in the trunk of a car, dead, with the words \\\"trick or treat\\\" carved into her, they send 2 cops to check things out. That place would have been crawling with cops, my suspension of disbelief doesn't go that far.  I don't mind downbeat endings, sometimes I find them preferable, but this ending just took the cake, I think mostly because it wasn't presented as a downbeat ending, again, I get the feeling that RZ views this as a happy ending. Also, if they were going to end it that way, couldn't at least one of the villains have gotten their comeuppance? I would have loved to see that evil, annoying (but very pretty), blond bimbo get whacked. But of course, I think the director saw them as the heroes of the movie.  I felt dirty after watching this movie.\", \"I have to ask because it seems that I'm not a true horror movie fan if I don't like this movie. Thats a load of crap. I have seen all the Nightmare on Elm Streets, Halloweens, Friday The 13ths, Hellraisers, Evil Deads, etc. etc. I like film directors like John Carpenter, Wes Craven, George A. Romero, Eli Roth. I've seen some obscure horror films too, like Blood Beach, The Company Of Wolves and even seen The Last House On the left (even though I didn't like it that much).  Problem I had with this film was it was too sadistic for its own good (the \\\"bunny\\\" killing scene especially made my blood turn cold), the villains antics grew tiresome, and THAT scene where the gun was held on the guy's head was JUST TOO LONG. No matter how stylish it was meant to be, it was just a director letting the scene run for too bloody long!  That said, I didn't totally dislike this movie. I could see that Rob Zombie has an obvious fondness for the horror movie and he set out to create a familiar story with his own sadistic and creative additions. The film was effective at making me wonder if the actors playing the villains were really acting or not, they did seem genuinely disturbed. However, the victims were kind of ho hum.  The production design of the film looked impressive too, with a lot of visual points of references to horror clich\\u00e9s.  Main problem was that I didn't really enjoy watching it, and I grew bored with it in its latter stages. It was shocking (in parts) just for being shocking and was just a film made by an amateur film maker (albeit an obviously enthusiastic one)\", \"If you like horror films then you will love this movie. 'House of 1000 Corpses' will keep you on edge, and scare the crap out of you. Rob Zombie is a brilliant horror writer, so if you are squeamish, please stay away! As far as horror movies go, this is among the best ever made. I compare almost all new horror movies to this one, and few come close to the extremity and violence of this film. People who give this movie a low rating do not appreciate true horror, and therefore should not be taken into consideration when evaluating whether or not to watch this movie. It goes from general nervous horror (like what are those crazy kids doing in that \\\"creepy country town\\\") to full out mutilating horror where people are getting scalped and slowly tortured. It leaves out nothing when it comes to messed up killings, Rob Zombie somehow thinks of it all. You don't have to be a Rob Zombie fan to like this movie, anyone I have ever watched this with has been horrified (to say the least) and that is what most people are looking for when turning to a truly scary movie for entertainment. I can't give 'House of 1,000 Corpses' enough praises for stepping outside the box of the general horror movie equation, adding both an intense plot and gruesome (not cheesy) effects. It is a movie that will stay with you, and will stand out in your mind when comparing it to the rest of the new millennium horror films. I absolutely love it!!!\", \"Initially I had little or no interest in this film but after hearing good things about it from a lot of sources I decided to check it out. Unfortunately for me this was not a new classic of horror that some people hail it as, it's a disjointed mess that's light on scares, originality, and fun. House of 1000 Corpses somehow manages even to mess up when it comes to plot structure, something even the lowest of horror movies can usually pull off.  It does have a few redeeming elements; the carnival sideshow style of horror is an interesting motif for the film, Sid Haig's character is cool and underused unfortunately, and occasionally Zombie manages to unnerve by using quick jumps to snuff like 16mm footage, a technique that would have been better served if the director was able to exercise more restraint, especially in the early film. The film also contains a rather clever plot misdirection about mid way through, a subplot about cops and one of the victim's father that makes you think the plot is going to evolve one way, but then completely changes direction you. I have to give credit to Zombie for fooling and surprising me.  The film's real problem is in the comparison it invites with its betters, this film basically is \\\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\\", and it doesn't hold up well to the seminal 1974 classic. A movie that was made for approximately $140,000, that still manages to be way more effective then House. Maybe if you stripped Zombie of his 7 million dollar budget he would have been able to show his true film-making chops and been able to pull off the low budget fun and carnage he so desperately tries to achieve with this film; more likely this film would have been stripped of it's disguise of high production values and clever sets, and be revealed to everyone as the naked unfocused mess that it is. Even with its budget, the gore is nothing; there is nothing shocking or creative or fun. Maybe the unrated version is better, but since it's completely unavailable I have no way of knowing. As the R rated version stands it fails as a gross out flick and then later goes on to fail even completely at the loftier goal of actually being scary. When I first watched TCM I really was unnerved by it, and I found myself thinking about for weeks after. I watched House of 1000 Corpses today, and nothing has stayed with me; what little effect it had on me was gone the second I stopped watching it. Hell, I might even be fooled into renting this again years from now when I completely forget about it.  \\\"So what\\\", you might say, \\\"it's not scary, not all movies of this variety have to be scary, look at Evil Dead 2\\\". Well the problem is it's not really fun either. The teen victims are completely indistinguishable, which in fairness is pretty common complaint for this genre, and the killers, who the film is obviously in love with, are just too gaudy and derivative of slasher stereotypes. The one that had the ability to stand out from the crowd, Sid Haig's Captain Spaulding, disappears for most of the movie. So for most the film you are left with a plot, that much like victims, runs but never gets anywhere. It almost seems like a masturbation reel for serial killers. I get what he was going for, I've seen the dinner scene from Texas Chainsaw Massacre (there is that comparison again, but I can't help if the shoe fits), Zombie just doesn't achieve the disquieting creepy effect that film had. Towards the end the plot just spirals out of control into what I think was a failed attempt at surrealism, personally I was just glad it was going somewhere. After what is a close approximation of the last teen going through a house of horrors, the films ends on a truly predictably note that once again feels ripped from TCM.  Overall this movie just kinda sucks plain and simple. I get that it's a homage, but it's just not a particularly effective one. Zombie might eventually be able to develop his directing into something interesting but first he has to clear the hurdle from music video style and shock to film atmosphere and substance. I will end by saying one more positive thing about the film; it's not the 2003 remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\", \"All I heard about all year was how great this movie was, and how scary it was. I'm going to be very blunt and fair. It isn't any of those things. I was horrified, in a bad way. The acting was so bad I almost left the room, the gory violence was WAY too much, and it only seemed that way because it was quite fake. There was so many plot holes I lost count! This is probably the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life! As soon as it ended, I grabbed the disk from my DVD player, put it back in it's case and returned it for my money back (To my misfortune, we bought it) That's 2 hours I'll never get back, save your time and money and don't see it. If Rob Zombie is giving up his music career for this... I am truely sad... all in all 0/10\", \"House of 1,000 Corpses (2003) marks the directorial debut of Trash/Industrial Artist Musician Rob Zombie. This film was sitting on the shelf for a couple of years before Lion's Gate released it theatrically. A homage of sorts to Zombie's favorite genre, southern fried horror. Throw in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, add a little Eaten Alive and a dash of FunHouse and you'll get the flavor of this film.   Four twenty somethings are riding along the back southern roads when they come across a roadside carnival run by an eccentric clown named Captain Spaulding. He gives them a personnel tour of his fun house of horrors and tells them the tale of a local ghoul named Doctor Satan. Inspired by phantasmagorical tale of the good doctor, they decide to search for his grave. Captain Spaulding draws them a map and gives them directions to an area where the Doctor allegedly died. On the road, they meet a pretty blond hitch-hiker who also knows about the legend of Doctor Satan...and a little more! What happens next? You'll have to visit House of 1,000 Corpses!  A great film that does what it sets out to do. I'm so glad to see old school grind house horror is back in the mainstream. A sequel is out and it's even better! I have to strongly recommend this movie. You won't regret it!\", \"I already had a user comment for \\\"House of a 1.000 Corpses\\\" submitted here on this site, dated over a year ago and\\u0085um\\u0085not very praising. In fact, my first viewing of this film was so disappointing that I excessively discouraged other people here to see it. Rather than to simply ignore the old comment and pretend I never bashed it, I wish to write a new \\u0096 more positive \\u0096 review, if it were only to convince other people (who also disliked at first) to give it a second change. Several factors (like the praising reviews on \\\"The Devil's Rejects\\\"-sequel and conversations with fellow horror fans) nearly forced me to re-watch \\\"House of a 1.000 Corpses\\\" and I'm glad I did. This truly is a film that requires multiple viewing before one can properly judge it. Rob Zombie's style is often innovating and so overwhelming that it might look overly hectic at first but, in reality, his dedication towards obscurity and his knowledge on classic cinema is one of the best things that could ever happen to the horror genre. And that is something you (or at least I) have to discover with repeated viewings\\u0085   The power of this film lies in the fact that the screenplay covers all kind of successful horror premises. Serial killers, mad doctors, a family of crazies, deranged clowns, devil-worshipers\\u0085.you name the type of terror and \\\"House of a 1.000 Corpses\\\" features it! This movie is a small revival of the entire horror genre all by itself. No extended and boring intros or pointless red herrings in this film, \\\"House\\u0085\\\" is straightforward and surefooted sickness from start to finish and you're given almost no time to breathe. Some of the sequences in this film are so damn close to brilliant that I can't possibly figure out why I didn't love them right away!! The execution-scene guided by the moody \\\"I Remember You\\\"-song, for example, is amazingly atmospheric and quite unsettling. Although Rob Zombie's directing skills are still open for improvement (the abrupt climax, overly rough editing), his debut is a staggering gorefest that every horror fan has to experience\\u0085repeatedly! Bring on the sequel\\u0085I'm ready now!!\", \"Its sad that a film as wonderfully made as this is so grossly misunderstood.  Let me say this right off that bat. If you're idea of a horror film is I know What You Did Last Summer and you consider Scream and The Exorcist to be the most shocking films ever made, this is not a film for you. If you havent seen I Spit on Your Grave, Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead or Last House on the Left, this is not a film for you. If you've never listened to \\\"Living Dead Girl\\\" or \\\"Superbeast\\\" this is not a film for you.  Now having said that, this is a film for me. It is a film for true horror fans, the kind that stay up and watch Dawn of the Dead and The Beyond, who know who Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento and George Romero are. This is a film that was meant to be seen by people like this and will only be enjoyed by people like this. This is not exactly mainstream stuff here. Only a small percentage of people enjoy this stuff, and for those people, this film is a true rivival of classic exploitive horror.  Rob Zombie has created a homage to 1970's exploitation/horror films, and he has been extremly successful in achieving that goal. The film borrows largely from Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Last House on the Left, with his own little bits of original demential thrown in and an assortment of other horror film references. The film tells the tale of four teenagers who are terrorized and tortured by a bizarre southern family living in a remote farmhouse in 1977. The film uses all sorts of camera tricks--negative colouring, split-screens and seemingly random inserts of grainy snuff-like footage of various S&M and gore images; the off-the-wall effect is similar to what Oliver Stone did in Natural Born Killers. The film is not about plot, or about characters. Its purpose is to shock and disturb, to serve no other function than to entertain through exploitation and disgusting and bizarre violence. Just as you think the limits of weirdness are approaching, Zombie takes the film a step farther, and before long you surrender yourself to the mercy of the film and just accept things for what they are. The film has the feeling of an out of control freight train being piloted by a madman and the climax of the film is truly bizarre. The reviewers who wrote the film off as overly-sadistic with little in the ways of character development, plot or suspence have come to see a different kind of film, perhaps more at home with titles like The Sixth Sense or Silence of the Lambs. The have no busineness debasing a great film like this.  Rob Zombie has created a film that is both a homage and derivative at the same time; most things in the film have been done before, in one shape or another, and the level of gore is a fraction of what was intended, due to its shameful R-rating. To see the inevitable Unrated Directors Cut on video is going to be a true horror experience.  But this film is something has hasnt been seen in decades and it has been made with the utmost care that only a true horror fan could provide. It is a film made by horror fans for horror fans, a true labor of love by Mr. Zombie, despite some flaws. If you arent sitting the theater going \\\"hey, theres Bill Mosely from TCM 2!\\\" or \\\"hey, that shot is a homage to the cover of Evil Dead!\\\" or \\\"hey, he wears peoples skin like Leatherface!\\\" then you probably arent meant to be seeing this film. But for those who are, the film is a true gem and a rarity; it is a kind of film that hasnt been seen on the screens in over twenty years and probably wont be for another twenty years. Get out there and enjoy this rare experience while you still can.  An instant cult-hit.  Grade: A  For true horror fans only. Everyone else just wont get it.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Human Nature\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0219822\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Hustler\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0054997\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"I Am Legend\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0480249\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Independence Day\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0116629\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0097576\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0087469\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Innerspace\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0093260\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"Oh my god, the 80's Dance music is REALLY bad!

Lots of creative thinking that make this movie a wonderful experience for both adult and children.  The story is great and the effects are excellent too. Too bad is that the inner part of the movie is not shown. The story should shown more on the body itself and not just a common red blood cells. Maybe the script/screen writer can expand it further by showing the audience how \\\"brain\\\" look like inside the head and human lung, heart, liver etc then it even worth too seen this movie as part of human entertainment.  thumb up.\", \"Holy crap, this is the funniest movie ever made, and my number #3 favorite movie of all time (second to The Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers, of course). What a heck of a cast! Martin Short, Dennis Quaid, and Meg Ryan are some of my favorite actors/actresses. How can you watch Martin Short get drunk in Tuck's office and not laugh?! Twistin the Night Away! BABEEEE! I am gonna buy the freakin thing someday, but nobody sells it! It must be one of those hard-to-find classics. Anyone who watches Innerspace and doesn't laugh, they don't know what humor is. Ya'll.\", \"I've heard some people to call 80s 'The Golden Era' and now after I saw this again after so many years I realized why. One of the greatest Sci-Fi movies were produced during this 'era' and even if you see them now again they will still keep you excited. I haven't seen this one long time ago (more than 10 years). I still remember how much amazed I was when I first saw it. I saw it so many times after that and I was enjoying it each time while I was watching it.   You can see the movies like this one these days. There weren't technologies which they could use to create such effects. That's why they (the effects) were just a part from the story and they weren't as many as they're in todays movies. The movies were so good because they were done with a real imagination.  Now the story some how stays like a background for the effects. They're doing movies which are rather like 3D PC games. They aren't interesting stories and they aren't cool characters. Effects only.\", \"Occasionally, a movie comes along that is a delight from the beginning to end. \\\"Innerspace\\\" had all of the elements perfect, from writing to acting.  Martin Short is absolutely hysterical. This was the perfect vehicle for his physical nature. I never laughed at him in other films as much as I did here.  As I recall this movie in my home town, it did not spend that much time in the theater. I never saw it until it was released on video. It apparently did not gross that much money, and that is a mystery to me. It remains one of my all-time favorites.\", \"A cocky, jerky, hyper-active/rambunctious test pilot (Quaid) who never outgrew his high school jock phase is miniaturized with the intention of being injected inside a rabbit, but when things go awry due to terrorist interference, he gets injected inside a man instead, specifically a hapless grocery store clerk (Short). With the bad guys hot on their trail and time running out before the pilot suffocates, the clerk must gain the trust and help of the pilot's unhappy girlfriend (Ryan, Quaid's real life ex-wife now). Naturally, over the course of their adventure the male bonding scenario results in the clerk getting in touch with his inner Rambo while the pilot learns that there's more to being a real man than just being overly aggressive and fearless.  Silly and absurd it may be, but still an engaging sci-fi comedy adventure. Well performed by the affable Short, the dependable Quaid and Meg Ryan at her cutest. The film's biggest flaw primarily is that it shows Dennis Quaid naked, and no one needs to see Dennis Quaid naked.\", \"Spielberg didn't direct this, but it has his fingerprints all over it. The king of schmaltz can't resist dumbing it all down and hamming it all up until he's sure all the kiddies will demand mum and dad take them to see it.  It didn't work this time; it bombed at the box office, and deservedly so. Trying to make a Sci-Fi and a comedy rolled into one just doesn't work. It didn't work here.  I feel a bit sorry for Dennis Quaid, I usually like his films, but nobody involved with this stinker had much choice, especially Dennis.  It didn't even work as fluffy, mindless entertainment, as some Spielberg films do, I just can't ignore the bad science and the misplaced humour.  I gave it a 3, simply because I managed to sit right through to the end.\", \"Innerspace is basically one long homage to Fantastic Voyage, but with Dante's typical weird comedy attached for good measure. All of Dante's favorite actors (William Schallert, Kevin McCarthy, Robert Picardo, Dick Miller) are along for the ride, but standouts are Quaid and Short. Meg Ryan in the Lois Lane role is less impressive. Overall, Innerspace is probably the wierdest \\\"buddy movie\\\" of all time.\", \"The best part about the movie was when \\\"Jack Putter\\\" was changing his facial features to become the cowboy and when he changed back!! That was hilarious!! I thought I was going to die I laughed so hard my sides hurt!! This was an excellent comedy, and Meg Ryan was great in the film also.\", \"I saw this ages ago, having recently watched on video. Normally I find comedies not worth watching twice, but Innerspace still made me laugh - even after all this time!!  Martin Short's character Jack Putter was great. He was a wimpy nerd, perfect to be injected in the butt by the doc carrying Dennis Quaid. I liked the part where his face was changed to the Cowboy's and back again. Very funny!!  Meg Ryan was a bit of a pain-in-the-butt (no pun intended), tho I think she should've married Jack, he was the cuter one!!! Dennis Quaid was great in this movie also, even confined to a teeny tiny pod floating around in Martins insides.  The inside-the-body SFX were cool. The scenes where Dennis had to escape the heart, plus the parts where he gets to see thru Martin's eyes etc really made good effects. It makes you wonder how you'd feel if that happened to you, Martin's reactions are priceless!!!  The bad guys provided plenty of comic relief, I like Cowboy's sleez and the big thug who fainted every time he saw something 'horrible'. The scene where Martin's hanging off the back of the truck was rather cool.  I recommend this flick to anyone who likes sci fi, comedy, romance, action, adventure! Because this movie has the lot!!  I give this flick 9 out of 10.\", \"This movie was one the first movies i watched and I loved it then and I love it 10 years later. Innerspace is another of those movies of the eighties that was charming and lovable to watch, they don`t make this great movies today.  The movie is an adventure comedy starring Martin Short who gives the performance of a lifetime, he`s great and enjoyable to watch. Dennis Quaid and a young beautiful and charming Meg Ryan stars as well. When i first saw the movie i fell in love with Meg, she was great.  The movie has a very good and entertaining story and you can`t stop watching and enjoying the dialogue and great performances. Director Joe Dante deliver a great show for both youngster and adults.\", \"When I saw this movie for the first time I wasn't Meg Ryan's fan yet. I think I watched it in one of this saturday morning tv session, I really liked, specially the cast. This wonderful girl, who I became fan later is really funny and totally different of the kind of characters she would became specialist later. Dennis Quaid is great, he is a very talented actor, but working with the woman he was going to marry is incomparable, there is a great chemistry between them. But the star of the movie is Martin Short, who is hilarious as the schizophrenic Jack. It's certainly the funniest science fiction movie ever made.\", \"I saw this when it first came out and it had everything going for it. Action, Comedy, a neat Sci-Fi premise,a great script and cast but it did horrible at the Box Office. Other than marketing, I have no idea why this never found it's audience and its a shame because it would have been nice to see a sequel that it was set up for at the end. It's kinda sad now that Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan have broken up because their paring made it all the more special. If you haven't seen this one, check it out.  Why is this not on DVD??????\", \"The premise is ingenious: a man injected into the body of another man. Brilliant!  The movie itself is crammed with wonderful twists and special effects. *Sigh* They just don't make them like this anymore. Great plot, great characters and a neat ending.  I've seen this movie when it was quite young and I've just seen it again. It's still great! If you didn't see it yet, you really should!\", \"A Navy pilot, Tuck Pendelton, (Dennis Quaid) has been chosen for a secret experiment to operate a pod-like craft that is miniturized smaller than a grain of salt to be injected into a laboratory rabbit. However, the experiment goes haywire, and a bad batch of dudes want to take over the Miniturization all together. After stealing a microchip that is required for the process, one of the scientists injects the pod into the hypochondriac Safeway employee, Jack Putter. (Martin Short)  Unfortunately, the one chip they've taken is useless without the other, which is inside the pod--which is inside Jack Putter!  Now Pendelton, his beautiful ex-girlfriend, Lydia, (Meg Ryan) and Putter, have to work together to get the other chip back, and re-enlarge the pod before Tuck runs out of oxygen.  This is one of my absolute favorite movies!  I love all of the comedy that fits perfectly with the plot, the stunning special effects of all the close-up views of the human body, and romantic twists that suits the movie as well.  I highly recommend this film for science-fiction, comedy, action, and romance movie fans....So this movie will most likely suit anyone!  If you haven't seen this, it's a MUST to rent or buy. Very exciting, delighting, and fun!  You wont regret watching it! :)\", \"Caveat: I have always hated Martin Short. I find him annoying, semi-retarded, and blame him for the Phoebe-Cates-career-killing \\\"Drop Dead Fred\\\", even if he was not even in that film. However, Short was quite amusing in this one.  \\\"Innerspace\\\" has Dennis Quaid shrunk down to be injected into a rabbit. Whoops! He's stolen by the villain from \\\"UHF\\\" and injected into Martin Short instead, who then must save Quaid with the help of Quaid's girlfriend, the pseudo-lesbian Meg Ryan.  Short's quirkiness worked for this film. I mean, goodness, he has a little man inside of him. And he works well with director Joe Dante, a Steven Spielberg prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 influenced by Bugs Bunny... his comedy is best reflected in \\\"Gremlins\\\" and \\\"Gremlins 2\\\". How he got to be a master of horror is beyond me (though one would assume from \\\"The Howling\\\").  The shots inside the body were interesting (like the \\\"Body Wars\\\" ride at Disney World), and Quaid was a great pilot for the adventure. I could have used less Meg Ryan, who seemed to be very unnecessary to the plot and her allegiance was unclear.  So um, yeah... it was a fun romp... watch it.\", \"So entertaining that there should be some kind of law passed against it, InnerSpace is a magnificently engaging example of top-drawer family entertainment, directed with charm, with, humour and imaginative verve by Joe Dante; despite Gremlins arguably being his most iconic and popular film, InnerSpace may very well be his finest hour. In the 1980's, Dante made some wildly enjoyable movies including Gremlins and its sequel, Explorers, The 'burbs and The Howling; usually state-of-the-art yet delightfully old-fashioned and nostalgic charming, thrilling, marvellously referential to older movies (I'd say Dante did this better than nearly any other director), and with very imaginative story-lines filled with quirky characters, surreal humour and generous lashings of excitement. It's no surprise that Steven Spielberg often had a hand in the making of many of his films, though Dante infuses his own offbeat style to the proceedings; Dante's got a agreeable sentimental streak, but he's also got an anarchic one too, something that would reach full crazy fruition with Gremlins 2.  Anyway, back to InnerSpace, which is a 1980's update of the Fantastic Voyage scenario, in which a man is miniaturised and injected into the body of another man; Lieutenant Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid) is the pilot agreeing be shrunk down to near-invisible proportions and then injected into the body of a rabbit, only for the experiment to be interrupted by evil rival scientists who want the all-important microchips necessary for miniaturisation. Somehow, Pendleton finds himself injected into hypochondriac supermarket clerk Jack Putter (Martin Short), whose life is a mess and has been instructed by his doctor to take it very easy, and to avoid excitement at all costs; bad news for Jack, great news for us. Pendleton manages to make audio contact with Jack from inside of him, and together they try and save Pendleton before his air supply runs out. Meanwhile, other characters start to get involved with the action, from Pendleton's ex girlfriend Lydia (Meg Ryan) to the mysterious Cowboy, the lethal Mr. Igoe (a man with a detachable hand that can be replaced with guns, white-hot flame throwers and something slightly more pleasurable as briefly glimpsed in one hilariously risqu\\u00e9 sight gag) and the evil Mr. Scrimshaw, a shrewd businessman who wants the microchips to sell to the highest bidder.  I'm a big fan of 1980's blockbusters, especially irreverent, imaginative fare like GhostBusters, Back to the Future, etc, not to mention masterworks such as Spielberg's early classics; in today's era of bigger, bigger and not quite better spectacle, the 1980's equivalent of the big summer movies look more and more like a Second Golden Age of Entertainment than ever before, with lots of films that haven't dated thanks to an abundance of great ideas, freshness, with, great genre performances and a healthy blend of natural, human character and fantastic special and visual effects. These days, blockbusters are too big, too empty and too superficially monumental, making them agreeable things to consume along with your popcorn at the cinema but proving to be hollow experiences when experienced on the small screen or even on a repeat viewing at the cinema. Of course, there are exceptions, especially Sam Raimi's delightful Spider-Man movies, but for me, the late 70's and 1980's was where it all worked best.  It's difficult to find a purely entertaining movie that not only has no flaws whatsoever, but whose virtues are almost consistently wonderful, but InnerSpace might be the one; Dennis Quaid never quite made it as a big A-list star, but here's he wonderfully likable, despite of (actually, maybe because of) his cockiness and smart attitude, and he manages to register a consistent strong presence throughout the film, even though he spends most of the time trapped in his tiny ship, thanks to his performance and his excellent chemistry with Martin Short, who never quite hit the jackpot in another film quite the way he does here. Here, he's absolutely hilarious; wound up, stressed, understandably amazed by just how insane this predicament he's stumbled into is (at first, quite realistically, he thinks he's losing his mind, maybe even possessed). Meg Ryan is also very charming and engaging as Lydia (very cute too, in the days before she milked said cuteness to disagreeable levels in her 90's films), who tags along for the ride but doesn't get let in on the whole truth of the story for the most part. As the villains, Kevin McCarthy (a Dante favourite) is brilliantly funny as Scrimshaw, while Fiona Lewis is very good as his man-eating deputy sidekick. As Mr. Igoe, Vernon Wells, a.k.a, The Campiest Villain Ever (as seen in Commando), manages to be genuinely chilling and scary for the second and last time in his career as a bad guy (the first was Mad Max 2), while Robert Picardo is painfully funny as the Cowboy; on an added note, his method of seducing women in nightclubs using an imaginary lasso does NOT work in real life. Not that I've tried, of course. Great comic support comes from Henry Gibson as Jack's boss at work, and Wendy Schaal as Jack's confused and selfish co-worker.  The action is wonderfully staged and sometimes quite suspenseful, especially Mr. Igoe's pursuit of the syringe early on in the film, a hilarious moment where Jack is flying off of the back doors of a van and a terrifically exciting encounter with a freshly shrunken Mr. Igoe and Pendleton above Jack's acid-raging stomach. The special effects are marvellous, especially when the film takes us inside Jack's body; these moments are often breathtaking, while's there's even a lovely moment when Pendleton temporarily finds himself inside Lydia and he sees their unborn child. The film is also hilarious, with countless great gags, a near-perfect balance between humour and excitement. By the end, you'll be left breathless, and yet it still manages to conclude on a delightful open note.  InnerSpace is one of my all-time favourite movies and one I still enjoy thoroughly every time I watch it.\", \"If you enjoy suspending disbelief and you appreciated \\\"Gremlins\\\", then this new offering form executive producer Steven Spielberg and director Joe Dante is guaranteed to keep you thoroughly entertained for over two hours (though you won't believe you've been sitting down that long). This extremely lively comedy concerns the misadventures of inept supermarket assistant manager Jack Putter (Martin Short), who is accidentally injected with a microscopic pod which contains a crack pilot who was supposed to be exploring a rabbit. So while Jack is beside himself with fears of demonic possession (he's hearing the voice of pilot Tuck Pendleton - Dennis Quaid), he is being pursued by government agencies and ruthless criminals. It all might sound rather fantastic, and it is, in the best possible way! Comic genius Martin Short really makes this movie his own with some outrageous antics (not unlike Jerry Lewis) that carry scene after scene, hilariously. Second billing really should go to Kevin McCarthy (though his is a small role) for his eccentric portrayal of Scrimshaw, the megalomaniac criminal who is 'just in it for the money'. Also great is Wendy Schaal, a checkout chick who is a little unsure about whether she should be dating the erratic Jack. Dennis Quaid makes a rugged, handsome hero while his real life wife Meg Ryan is a pretty heroine, in one of her better roles. Other strong support comes from Fiona Lewis and Henry Gibson.  Director Dante and screenwriters Chip Proser and Jeffrey Boam (Proser wrote the original story) have a ball with the wild premise (based loosely on \\\"Fantastic Voyage\\\" - 1966) and milk the comedy aspect dry, whilst the Academy Award winning visual effects team recreate the inside of the human body spectacularly, and Jerry Goldsmith provides a very effective and at times rousing score.  \\\"Innerspace\\\" is one of those movies that's loads of fun no matter how many times you see it! Several scenes are still riotously funny even for the fifth time. If only for Martin Short's manic performance and the brilliant special f/x, this picture is a must.  NB What looked like an opening for a definite sequel never did eventuate, or at least no yet!  Saturday, July 15, 1995 - Video\", \"My Take: Hilarious oddity piece with imaginative special effects and an appealing cast.   What a weird way to make a movie! And yet, what a fun and enjoyable film it is. INNERSPACE is a highly enjoyable little film, with some fine nifty special effects and some hilarious performances by Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan and Martin Short. Not to mention Joe Dante's wacky inventiveness in his direction makes INNERSPACE is fun film for a very fun-loving audience.  Quaid plays Tuck Pendelton, a party animal of a scientist who volunteers to be shrunk to microscopic size and injected to the insides of a lab test rabbit. Things get awry when a rival company wrecks havoc in the lab, and one of his colleagues is forced to inject him to hypochondriac Jack Putter (Short) instead. While trying to find his way out of Putter's body, Tuck changes Jack's life, as he becomes his \\\"conscience\\\". On their trail is Victor Eugene Scrimshaw (Kevin McCarthy) and his group who wants this little science project for themselves. Then on is a combination of various chases, wackiness and secret services.  The movie takes the plot of an old B-movie, and brings it back to life, turning it to a fun and highly-spirited sci-fi comedy. It's like Richard Fleischer's classic THE FANTASTIC VOYAGE, but it has its own unique ideas and storyline to set its differences. Dante keeps all in fast pace, and doesn't keep us waiting for something to happen. The characters played by the leads are appealing and the script is filled with genuine laughs, with Short given the most. INNERSPACE is enjoyable entertainment, not to be taken seriously.  Rating: **** out of 5.\", \"This movie has a lot of elements to it and it strangely worked for me. I do not think it was a super success at the box office, but for me the movie was a very funny film. I do feel this one is more of a comedy than action or science fiction as Martin Short steals the show as the guy who ends up getting Dennis Quaid's character shot into his buttocks. The story, a group of scientist have invented a shrinking ray and they have used it to shrink Quaid's character and a ship to super small size. They aim to inject the ship and Quaid into a bunny, but some sort of attack occurs and he ends up injected into Short's character instead. So the rest of the film is the group that attacked the scientist coming after Short while Quaid tries to figure out a way to get big again. There are some interesting scenes of the insides of Short, though one has to wonder why they would have a device to attach to the inner ear of the bunny as I do not think you can talk to a bunny. The eye part though makes sense though. Another thing that makes little sense is the dude with the hand attachments, seems like a character that should be in a James Bond movie or something. I know there was a character exactly like that in a movie that was sort of a Get Smart movie called \\\"The Nude Bomb\\\" or something to that extent. This film though for the most part worked, especially when it was being a comedy.\", \"The great thing about Joe Dante in the 1980s was his knack for instilling humor into the sci-fi genre. Innerspace is probably one of the greats in that category, mixing in some great special effects (for its time) and some hillarious performances by Martin Short and Dennis Quaid. But what I especially enjoyed was the concept, turning a film that could have been serious and urgent into a film that was both funloving and interesting to watch. Sure, the whole idea is bupkiss and it was an homage to Fantastic Voyage, but the twist Dante put on it certainly makes it worth watching over and over.\", \"Can anybody tell me why almost everybody loves \\\"Back to the Future\\\" yet nobody ever deigns to mention this little beauty in the same breath? It more than deserves it.   Quaid is excellent as the cocky yet likeable \\\"Tuck Pendleton\\\". Here is a character who has personality to spare and a nice line in putdowns. You get the sense that he gets as exasperated with Jack as we the audience do. Quaid can really deliver when given the right material, something that Hollywood provides all too scarcely.   (POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREON)   Short overacts but is still pretty funny, and anyway, I suppose exaggeration is forgivable given that he's playing a neurotic. Ryan is cute but in all honesty is not given that much to work with. It's credit to her talent that she manages to stand out at all.   Mr Igo is a cool villain, but one of many elements in the plot that aren't exploited to their full potential. The film is so bursting with invention that often things are touched upon and then dropped before they've really been explored. This all goes to show, however, that the film doesn't stand still for a minute, which can only be a good thing, especially when you have Quaid firing off the wisecracks.   It's fair to say that amidst all the general good fun the special effects aren't always something you notice, but they are superb, especially for '87. Never once do they undermine the story.   It really is Quaid's film though, personal favourite lines including \\\"Dip, Dip, Dip all you like. Nothin's gonna fit ya\\\" and \\\"You better, you two-faced sonofab**ch\\\"   An absolute blast from start to finish; this really is unfairly overlooked as being 'just another remake of 'Fantastic Voyage'\\\", when in reality it compares well with acknowledged classics of the comedy adventure genre such as \\\"Back to the Future\\\".\", \"Joe Dante may be the zaniest director out there, along with Tim Burton. \\\"Matinee\\\" is my favorite of his movies, but \\\"Innerspace\\\" is certainly also up there. For the for couple of minutes, I couldn't figure out what was going on, but suddenly, the plot became clear. Lt. Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid) is shrunk down to the size of a dust speck to be injected into an animal - a la \\\"Fantastic Voyage\\\". But then, a terrorist group seizes the lab and one of the scientists carries the hypodermic out. With his last bit of strength, he injects Tuck into local dweeb Jack Putter (Martin Short) - without informing Jack of this. From there, some very embarrassing predicaments arise for the two men, not the least of which is how to explain the situation to explain to Tuck's hubby Lydia Maxwell (Meg Ryan).  Throughout, \\\"Innerspace\\\" has Dante's quirky mark all over it. Dante of course gives a role to Dick Miller: in this case, Miller plays a cab driver. Dante regulars Kevin McCarthy and Robert Picardo also star, the former as villain Victor Scrimshaw, the latter as Scrimshaw's associate Cowboy. With some crazy lines, this movie is pure fun for everyone.\", \"'Innerspace ''is a science fiction movie from the 80's, full of comedy and full of stars, like Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan (this one very young and very thin in her 20's), Martin Short, and Kevin McCarthy. I personally find this movie adorable, since the scenes showing Tuck Pendleton inside of the human body, amazes me until today, seeing all those organs, embryo and even the cells in the veins.  I am not surprised to see that this movie is produced by Steven Spielberg, since the guy has a natural talent to make most of the movies a great success, with incredible stories.  The plot: Pilot Lt. Tuck Pendleton is a member of a top-secret miniaturization experiment, that sadly goes wrong when a rival team of scientists, try to stole their plans and ideas to make miniaturization a success for them. Instead of being inside of a rabbit, Tuck ends in the body of Jack Putter, a hypochondriac who thinks that now is listening to strange voices inside his head. When Jack discovers about Tuck, an awesome adventure begins, with Jack, Tuck and even Tuck's girlfriend, trying to help Tuck to be back in his natural size.\", \"When Joe Dante wanted to do a remake of Fantastic Voyage, I liked the way he decided to make his version into a comedy. I was surprised to discover that this film wasn't too successful, because I believe Innerspace is good solid entertainment, albeit daft.  The story begins when Lt Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid), an excellent pilot but an irresponsible hard drinker volunteers for a highly unusual experiment. He will be placed inside a submersible pod, and with the use of two microchips, be miniaturised and injected into a laboratory rabbit (called Bugs, what is it about Joe Dante and Looney Tunes characters anyway?).  But just after Tuck has been shrunk, a group of Silicon Valley industrial spies break into the lab, and steal one of the microchips necessary to reverse the miniaturisation process. In desperation, one of the scientists (Ozzie) runs with the syringe Tuck is in, and injects him into the body of Jack Putter (Martin Short).  Jack is a stressed out hypochondriac who is terrified of life, and learning that a shrunken human being is inside his body doesn't make him any less neurotic. With Tuck and Jack now having to depend on each other for survival, they team up with Tuck's ex girlfriend Lydia Maxwell (Meg Ryan) to recover the stolen chip before Tuck's air supply runs out.  I must confess to being a sucker for these loser comes out on top stories, and this film is no exception. Jack is a man who has nothing going for him in life, but with Tuck urging him on, Jack manages to find inner confidence he never knew he had and takes control of his life.  Both Tuck and Jack's characters go through changes in this film. Seeing the world through Jack's eyes, Tuck begins to reflect upon the mistakes he has made in his life. His irresponsible behaviour and heavy drinking was responsible for Lydia breaking up with him, and he wouldn't be in the situation he's in now if he hadn't recklessly gone through with this hare brained experiment.  Dennis Quaid makes a likable character as Tuck, because although he is a wise guy, his pep talks to Jack are quite inspiring and how you can learn to take control of your own destiny.  Martin Short is also a likable hero as Jack, although he does have a tendency to go over the top. Although he is supposed to be neurotic, his antics can grate on you a little on occasion. Some of his antics can be funny too, such as the crazy dance he does in Tuck's apartment, and yelling \\\"I'm possessed\\\" when he first hears Tuck's voice inside his head.  The different scrapes they get into are quite exciting, such as Jack's hanging on for dear life at the back of a refrigerated truck (although it is a little overlong). Tuck's battle with one of the spies inside Jack's body is very well done, and the method of killing him is quite innovative too.  One of the funniest scenes is when Tuck alters Jack's face to look like The Cowboy (Robert Picardo), someone who has come to buy the microchip off Scrimshaw (Kevin McCarthy), the man responsible for stealing the chip in the first place. The special FX for these scenes are pretty amazing, and the look on everyone's faces during these transformations are priceless.  The FX used for inside Jack's body are incredible, and are totally realistic. One of the best scenes is when Tuck is nearly pulled into Jack's heart, and is very nail biting. Another good scene is when Tuck ends up in Lydia's body through a kiss with Jack, and sees his unborn child in her womb. That is a very awe inspiring scene, and is worthy of the same fascination that made Fantastic Voyage great.  I believe this is a criminally underrated film. Admittedly, its a hard film to swallow, with things like altering Jack's face to look like someone else. How exactly could you do that? But this is a Joe Dante film, so you have to suspend disbelief a little. Meg Ryan isn't given enough to do, and its a pity her character couldn't have been given enough development.  There are also a lot of things happening in this film, and not everything is tied up like it should have been. The way Innerspace ends, there could have been a sequel, but so far it hasn't been followed up. With Dennis Quaid's and Meg Ryan's divorce that doesn't seem very likely now.  Still, Quaid has got a brilliant rapport with Short, and some (if not all) of the important matters are resolved. Its an entertaining film, and you find yourself being pulled along for the ride whether you like it or not. After Gremlins, Innerspace is my favourite Joe Dante film.\", \"Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid) is a hotshot Navy pilot on an unusual and top secret mission; he is to be shrunk down and injected into the body of a rabbit, but when things go wrong he ends up inside Jack Putter (Martin Short) instead. Jack must now work with Tuck in order to stay alive; and it's a great ride.  All the cast are good in this film, but Martin Short is brilliant; it's wall to wall action, adventure and laughs, and with a little romance thrown in, it's a winner. The special effects are outstanding for the time and Joe Dante's direction is excellent.  Innerspace is fun for the whole family 7/10\", \"This movie offers perfect entertainment.  The main characters and the performances by the actors are very good and comical. The movie is filled with some crazy 'not-so-everyday' characters and the villains are deliciously stereotyped and highly entertaining and there are some simply hilarious moments throughout the movie.  The movie can be described as an adventure science-fiction comedy. Surely the movie will not be remembered as one of the best of all time but I will always remember this movie as a very entertaining one and of which I have some very fond childhood memories.  The nice 'unknown' musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is very good, I actually watched this movie in honor of his death the day he had died, on 21 July 2004.  As long as you don't expect a masterpiece and merely want to be entertained, this movie is perfectly recommendable. Also very watchable for the entire family.  7/10\", \"What a funny thrill ride this movie is! A man (Dennis Quaid) volunteers to be shrunk down to the size of a cell and injected into a rabbit. But terrorists are after this scientific breakthrough and by various hijinks he winds up being injected into the butt of a nervous grocery clerk, played by Martin Short. And that's just the beginning.  Innerspace shows Dennis Quaid at his most winning, and Short at his funniest. And of course, there's a very young Meg Ryan as their love interest. The jokes resonate with both kids and adults, and unlike most action-adventure films, the plot here is never short of ideas. And the effects are pretty neat too: as we see Quaid's character wander within the human body, we feel as much amazement and wonder as he does. LOTS of movies attempt to put you in outer space and worlds far away, but I can't think of one that has made the creative attempt of exploring our inner space.  I first saw \\\"Innerspace\\\" when I was 11. I didn't know who any of the lead actors were. I'd never seen Saturday Night Live. And I thought it was a great movie. Twelve years and hundreds of movies later, I still think it's wonderful.\", \"This is an updated \\\"Fantastic Voyage\\\" and interestingly done, I thought. Joe Dante directed a number of fun movies to watch.  It's not the innocent Steven Spielberg \\\"E.T.\\\"-like movie I expected because of the language and several sex jokes. In other words, this is not a kids' movie.  Dennis Quaid stars and plays his usual cocky self. (He's mellowed in recent years.) Meg Ryan is her usual cute-but-of-little-substance self and Martin Short is just plain funny - the best guy in the movie.  The film offers a good combination of humor and science-fiction suspense. It's a fun movie I would rate higher if it weren't so silly in spots.\", \"This 1987 film is a wonderful combination of sci-fi, comedy, romance and thriller elements. It is briskly paced despite being almost two hours in length, and features superb performances from the leads; Dennis Quaid is excellent as usual, as is Meg Ryan in her best role. Yet the plaudits must go to Martin Short in a truly great performance he has never matched. He just needs the right role. The supporting cast are great as well; the delightful villainy of Vernon Wells who is unrecognisable as usual! Also Robert Picardo camping it up superbly as The Cowboy, one of his most memorable creations, plus the great pairing of Fiona Lewis and Kevin McCarthy, who memorably says to his dog before feeding it: 'Never beg, never beg!' The cinematography and special effects/makeup are all great as well, and Jerry Goldsmith's score is brilliant, perfectly complementing the tone of the film, alternately exciting/sprightly/romantic. Joe Dante binds it all together with magnificent verve, plus Dick Miller makes his trademark appearance! A great, timeless classic.

I have to say that it is one of the best movies I have ever seen, nearly flawless, with Mann's superb direction, frenetic camerawork, brilliant music score, and a phenomenal performance from Crowe as the whistleblower of a tobacco company, defining him as a promising future star. He is always convincing and a joy to watch. Al Pacino is in his typical fiery form as a 60 minutes producer, and it all combines to make this exceptional masterpiece, a great work of genius. 10/10.\", \"After getting nominated for 7 Academy Awards, I was dying to see The Insider. Well, I must say, I was basically blown away by how much effort went into this film, and it is very recommendable.  Based on a magazine article, The Insider follows the true story of Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), head of a tobacco company's Research And Development department, who discovers that the fag companies have for years not only known that nicotine was addictive, but worse, they've been messing around with the formula to make it even more so. After being persuaded to give a TV interview by producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino Pacino), Wigand discovers that smoking is deeply bad for your health, even if you've never lit a gasper in your life. Harassment, death-threats, a possible prison sentence and a collapsed marriage are a few of the ordeals that Wigand is put through -all, it would appear, to no avail when squabbling at CBS' 60 Minutes news programme leads them to ditch the programme, much to Bergman's horror.  Some powerhouse performances here, Al Pacino is corker as Bergman, but New Zealander Russell Crowe pulls off the most impressive act in the film, therefore earning himself an Oscar nomination. Michael Mann, director of Heat, has assured direction here, he knows what he's doing, and he does it well, his script for The Insider is also well thought-out and amazingly clever. The only faults there may be here is the fact that The Insider could be a big bore for some audiences, but for me, it was an enthralling experience.  A well done film, definitely worth your time.  I rate The Insider 8 out of 10.\", \"In writing this review, I'm tempted to address it to Don Hewitt and Mike Wallace. The Insider is a devastating film, but I think they are mistaken, if they see it as a blanket indictment of 60 Minutes. It's a blanket indictment of the tobacco industry. I don't think we will ever get to the bottom of what went on at 60 Minutes, with respect to the treatment of the Jeffrey Wigand interview. This movie is a dramatic piece that takes a stab at it, and I think that heaping criticism on Director/Writer Michael Mann is a huge mistake. This film shouldn't be picked at, it should be applauded. The spirit of this film is exactly the same as that of 60 Minutes. I doubt that most people watch 60 Minutes with a notepad in their hands. I think 60 Minutes gets people to think, and hopefully look into issues that are important. I believe that was Michael Mann's goal.  The first issue to tackle is the presentation of Lowell Bergman, former producer at 60 Minutes, as the white knight of the story. There were complaints that Bergman got credit for things he didn't do, and that he didn't quit when they said he did, etc. I'm reminded of the avalanche of criticism that Oliver Stone received when he chose Jim Garrison as his vehicle to probe the JFK assassination. As Michael Kinsley noted at the time, critics assailed Stone for making a hero of Garrison, whom many considered a shameless self-promoter and a man of shaky morals, at best. While this attack was taking place, across the multiplex you could go see Warren Beatty and Writer James Toback's near deification of Benjamin Siegel in Bugsy. I'm tempted to say that it's Michael Mann's dime, so he can pick whatever hero he likes. However, I think the truth is that there was a wealth of information he needed to convey, and selecting Bergman as his vehicle was the best way to go.  The second issue which had supposedly \\\"independent\\\" viewers up in arms was the aura of suspicion, manufactured or otherwise, that surrounded Jeffrey Wigand. This man will probably remain an eternal enigma. Was he exaggerating his claim of being harassed for some hidden agenda? Did he lie about finding a bullet in his mailbox? Did he try to cover up that he stole an electric can-opener?  This second issue is at the core of my argument in defense of this film. Question: Isn't it more important that Wigand, a scientist who worked for Brown & Williamson, provided undisputed testimony that nicotine was being manipulated to bolster it's addictive qualities, than whether or not he stole an appliance at Walmart? Shouldn't people be more disgusted by the laughable testimony to congress by the seven heads of big tobacco (The Seven Dwarves, as he refers to them)?  This movie became itself. It's a story of how many forces there are out in the world that seek to silence agitators. The simple truth is that Wigand, Wallace and Bergman had a story to tell and were crushed by some of these forces. Mann and Co-Writer Eric Roth wanted to tell this story on as big a screen as possible, and they got crushed, too. I'm surprised we didn't hear about how Michael Mann stole some lawn darts when he was in high school, or that Roth missed a Alfa-Romeo payment when he was in college. I hope this irony is not lost on Mike Wallace and Don Hewitt.  It's no surprise that this film (vastly superior to the diverting, but hardly earthshaking American Beauty) was shut out at the Oscars. Kevin Spacey is one of our finest actors, but his character is not in the league of Russell Crowe's work here. Crowe's Wigand, with his birdlike and occasionally irritating behavior, with his egotism, with his intelligence, whoa! This is a performance. Reporters once again had a little fun when it was reported that Crowe didn't invite the real Wigand to the premiere. I guess this Crowe guy must be a schnook. Don't give him the Oscar.  Truth be told, acting kudos go to all involved. Pacino, as Bergman, creates a stubborn character, who's not ashamed of his liberal nature, even when he's in a sea of conservatives. Christopher Plummer's controversial characterization is a delight as well. He gets Wallace's legendary tempestuousness, his egotism and his smarts down to perfection. The small characters are drawn with a sharp eye, as well. Alert to reporters: Mann's wife Diane Venora plays Wigand's wife. Bad news, though, she's a wonderful actress, and she's great here. Sorry.  As the settlements from big tobacco come down, Mann's working on a film about about Ali, Bergman's back working in Berkeley where he belongs, Wigand is up to God knows what, and 60 Minutes chugs on, popular as ever. Memo to Mike Wallace and Don Hewitt: This was an excellent film. Admit it!!  \", \"This movie is very, very good. When I read that it was 2 1/2 hrs, I thought, \\\"Oh, no, boooring.\\\" But first off, this movie is so interesting that it didn't seem much longer than the typical 90 minute flick. And as many dramas are, this film may be a little slow in some parts, but I never lost interest, not once. Crowe was great, and I was impressed by Pacino's performance, who I've admittedly lost confidence in over the last decade or so. Probably his best in many years. Granted, most \\\"based on a true story\\\" films fictionalize 90% of the film (i.e. Titanic, Perfect Storm), but this movie was still loyal to the basic truths. Very compelling, go rent this one soon.\", \"Eric Roth (The Horse Whisperer, Suspect) has written great scripts. The Insider kept me watching, and grabbed my attention. Very well written and with a great cast \\\"Lowell Bergman\\\" Al Pacino (The Godfather, Looking for Richard) is a great character. I remember something about the incident. Russell Crowe (Gladiator, Proof of Life) is a very good actor. The man he plays \\\"Jeffrey Wigand \\\" is very smart, has a lot of knowledge about the cigarette industry, and who was willing to come forward to tell that the cigarette industry was in privy that cigarettes are addicting. Well, not to put the character down, but I believe that everybody knows that. The entire world knows that... Why don't they do something about it, you've guessed it money! Why they decide to destroy the life of Wigand is beyond me because the whole world knows to be true what he was going to say anyway. But they destroyed him, and the movie is about how he was followed, stalked, terrorized. and so on. When I was young I also believed in changing the status quo, but after having gone through severe trials because I am outspoken I have learned to keep my mouth shut. Is it good, that I have learned that? Not sure! But for some reason sometimes even describing the obvious in the world is an impossible thing to do. Why? I don't know. This is an excellent movie which I recommend. My favorite scene: Is a conversation where Lowell Bergman states: \\\"You'd better look into it, because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious.\\\" Favorite Quotes: Jeffrey Wigand: \\\"I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials.\\\" Lowell Bergman: \\\"To a network, probably, we're all commodities. To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.\\\" I recommend this movie. It is excellent.  \", \"This easily one of the top 3 movies I've ever seen. GREAT acting from top to bottom, a great story line, editing, directing, everything. Russell Crowe deserves all the success he gets after this film - he was BRILLIANT. I saw it toward the end of its run, and boy am I glad I caught it while it was still in theaters.  Also the movie poster is really cool, I'd highly recommend checking ebay or online stores if you're into that sort of thing.  Off to see Traffic...\", \"What is essentialy a very simple story is made into a compelling masterpiece by Russel Crowe and Al Pacinos performance's.   Michael Mann certainly is the mann as even with the great acting the film would have been very dull with out the direction of Mann. His ability to keep the atmosphere of the film going through image and music is second to none. Suspence is held throughout with a kind of feer to the characters.  We have to wait till the end for his trademark slow motion frame, but it well worth it.  Excellent Film.  \", \"Not that it's any big surprise that corporate interests supercede reporting/news on the boob tube, The Insider still chillingly portrays the plight of Jeffrey Wigand, ex tobacco company scientist, on his whistleblowers journey with the 60 Minutes TV Newsmagazine. This movie had me on edge the whole way. Outstanding performances, especially from Christopher Plummer. His turn on Mike Wallace is unforgettable. This Actor is IN THE ZONE! Al Pacino makes it look eeeeaaasy, and Russell Crowe transcends his dialect struggles (he goes with a mishmash of \\\"American\\\" dialect, and at times I found it a little distracting), but he scores with his understated Pressure Cooker character development. The screenplay and writing is wonderful, as are many supporting roles. If you haven't seen this one, you owe it to yourself to check it out.\", \"The Insider is the story of Jeffery Wigand (again Oscar-worthy Russell Crowe), a former tobacco company scientist that begins to rebel against his former employer. With the help of 60 Minutes producer played by Al Pacino. Wigand tells the story of what the tobacco companies do not want you to know. He then realizes that maybe everything he is doing isn't worth all he has lost, (i.e. his family, his safety, his job). This film was a real controversial masterpiece of modern times. It was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, and though I agree with giving Best Picture, Actor, and Director to American Beauty, this film should have won something, possably Best Screenplay.\", \"Russell Crowe shows what great acting is, in his emotional and dynamic portrayal of the corporate tobacco executive cut loose for knowing too much and having a conscience.  Only one flaw appeared in this movie, the casting of the excellent actor Michael Gambon as the villainous tobacco company chairman. He wasn't quite convincing about having a southern accent, a glitch that was slightly distracting to the otherwise intense scenes he appeared in.  Otherwise every part in this movie was played to perfection, especially by Crowe and Pacino. A very believable effort by Christopher Plummer as the venerable Mike Wallace, and all the other supporting roles tell a story of truth, morality, and justice in a way that surpasses the run-of-the-mill Hollywood flick.  A great movie, one of the best, that would be great even if there were no truth to it.\", \"There is just no way that a movie about '60 minutes' should be 3 hours long, yet Michael Mann finds a way to drag this out, much like he did in Heat. Yet despite the fact that the movie moves with the speed of a three-toed sloth on a NyQuil bender, the performances are absolutely hypnotic. Pacino, who is usually either great or cartoonish, delivers an adequate performance, but an unrecognizeable Russell Crowe is simply phenomenal. But the most spellbinding character belongs to Christopher Plummer, who steals every scene he's in with an astounding take on Mike Wallace. This isn't a bad movie by any means, but it's an actors movie; the performances really redeem what is otherwise an overlong exercise in directorial self-indulgence.\", \"There's hardly a flaw in this true account of the 60 Minutes expose of a tobacco industry cover-up.  Al Pacino is brilliant as Lowell Bergman, the 60 Minutes producer who struggles to convince former tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand (equally brilliantly played by Russell Crowe) to grant an interview in the face of the industry's attempts to silence him, and then has to fight CBS management to put the interview on the air. This is just a marvelous film.  From the beginning scenes of the setting up of an interview between Mike Wallace (played by Christopher Plummer, who does a valiant job in a difficult role, playing someone as well known as Wallace) and an Arab sheik involved with the Hezbollah movement we get a sense of the point to come: that dealing with Middle East terrorists is a lot safer than taking on the tobacco industry! We're also hit right off the top by the irony underlying everything. Wigand, who worked as a senior executive for a tobacco company, is a health care specialist with a seriously asthmatic daughter.  The first part of the movie plays like a spy thriller, as it focuses on the threats made against Wigand and family to silence him, and the pressure this puts on his family life as we literally see the man begin to crumble under the pressure. The focus of the second half shifts to Bergman's desperate attempts to get Wigand's interview broadcast after everything he has risked to blow the whistle. The battle between Bergman and CBS, also under pressure from the industry not to air the story, and vulnerable due to the network's impending sale, is well portrayed.  This movie is absolutely worth the watching. It is vaguely ominous as we're confronted by the power not just of the tobacco industry, but of big business in general. Definitely a 9 out of 10.\", \"When you put two people like Al Pacino and Russell Crowe, you know you have a good thing.  This movie, although a bit on the lengthy side at 2 and a half hours, keeps you pretty much involved the entire way. Al Pacino plays great journalist looking for the big story, but gets personal when Russell Crowe loses his job as a researcher for a big tobacco firm, and starts to come loose at the edges because of some damaging information he is aware of.  The movie provides some very original plot twists, and kept it surprisingly real. They probably could have cut about 30 mins of footage, but after seeing Mike Wallace freak out...I can understand the length. I definately recommend, but get comfy.\", \"This movie is fantastic. When I saw this movie, I figured it was just going to be a boring and long movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. Sure it was long, but The Insider kept your attention for every second of the film. Russell Crowe, once again, is magnificent. I just can't get over what a great actor he is. Every character Russell plays he makes seem so real and I couldn't help to think that Russell was robbed out of the award for Best Actor at the Academy Awards. His Oscar win for the role of Maximus in Gladiator (for which he deserved all the way) makes up for it though. He absolutely amazes me. Not only is he SO CUTE (well, not in The Insider because he played a 53-year-old, but he looks cute in most of his other performances) but he is also an amazing actor. Al Pacino also gave an excellent performance. He too makes his characters seem real in every movie he is in. The cast for this movie was phenomenal. This movie kept you on the edge of your seat. I absolutely loved this movie. It's definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie, you have to go see it and I guarantee that you will thoroughly enjoy it. I give it a 10 out of 10.\", \"Although the movie's subject was the corruption of a cigarette-manufactory and the way a honest man and a journalist work together to bring it out, the mainstream was the courage of a man nearly paralyzed by fear yet determined to do what has to be done. Never before I saw an actor \\\"breathing\\\" fear and determination so intensely during the whole length of a movie as Crowe did here. He should have won his OSCAR-nomination that year.\", \"I started watching this at midnight, not knowing it was nearly 3 hours long, and did not feel urged to divide it into an additional viewing.  Everything you have heard about this movie is probably true.  Mann crafts a wrenching tale of two men's plight to adhere to their personal ethics. One a Newsman, Pachino. The other a scientist, Crowe.  If the satirical lunacy of \\\"Thank You For Smoking\\\" could be akin to the easy goings of Gerber Baby sauce, then this indigestion in the form of a laxative.  Mann's uncanny and infamous eye for precision and uncompromising realism is a marvel of stylish substance in itself. Almost like it's own thematic element regardless of what it's attempting to illustrate or accompany as a motif.  Unfortunately, I had been preprogrammed by his former films; \\\"Heat,\\\"0 \\\"Collateral\\\" and the often overlooked, \\\"Miami Vice,\\\" to expect some sort of climactic hell-storm of machine gunfire. At first, I was actually--prematurely, at that--deeming this destined to be a stop-gap film in Mann's career. By mid-way, the sentiment of how wrong I had been was becoming more than embarrassingly palpable with each furthered development in the plot.   The film could have ended several times. It could have inferred several completely differing resolutions. It proceeds despite itself to formulate it's plot out of significant character's arcs and roles, rather than playing to simply Crowe's predicament. Mann's narrative and subject matter is so layered and sparse with an unrecognizable plot at first glance, it could have properly faired well as a mini-series, similar to that of \\\"State of Play.\\\"\", \"The movie is loosely based on a true event covered by Frontline about a tobacco scientist titled \\\" The Man who knew too much\\\". The trauma that a man undergoes to reveal a truth which he was bound to keep through a confidentiality agreement is the central plot. In his quest to reveal to the world about the tricks the tobacco giants are employing to increase the sales of cigarettes , he is haunted and tormented to the extent of even losing his family for a just cause he believed in . It shows how big and powerful corporates work hard to keep things a secret.It's a movie on the triumph of the human spirit, and it's upon us to keep our human values and human spirits high. Stellar performances by Al Pacino and Russell Crowe makes you forget you are watching a movie. Great stuff from a gutsy director. Micheal Mann, you did it again.\", \"The Insider (1999)  Wow, this is a searing, amazing tour-de-force. It comes across as fearless, and you wonder just how it got the okay to tell as much truth as it does. It slams the tobacco industry and CBS Corporation equally (though CBS News, as such, rises above). It creates a fluid, fast, intelligible, and moving story involving several key players. And it avoids sentiment, clich\\u00e9, and shock, which is sort of amazing for a Hollywood film right there.  Add three amazing, central performances by men who take on their roles as if they needed to for their lives. First is Al Pacino, who often plays the righteous and indignant voice of justice, and he plays it with more justice here than ever. Then there is Russell Crowe, playing the \\\"insider\\\" himself, a tobacco industry chemist who spills the beans about the lies in the industry, and with real psychological subtlety. And then, in more of a surprise, Christopher Plummer plays one of Pacino's counterparts with perfect pitch.  Anthony Mann deserves a huge hand for his role pulling this together. He has a deft touch. He handles big material (spectacular stuff, really) with a steady beat of conviction, as if the point is not drama, but resolution. The music is superb, making clear that this is of course still a drama, and the editing, easily overlooked, creates a relentless but not distracting pace, leaving little things hanging just enough to keep us in suspense without obscuring the narrative.  I sound breathless in praise, and I suppose my one reservation is that the movie, since it is based on known facts (and uses real names throughout), lacks imagination. That's a bizarre comment, and not a complaint, exactly, but there is a sense when all is done that it was already known from the start. Getting there was amazing, but the result is a heightened version of what we know and see all the time in the news and in the corporate worlds. And sometimes elements are repeated too often (the video tape), so you can see a trimmed down version having even more impact.  But let me go back to being breathless. This is an overlooked, wonderful movie. That it holds interest so well after a decade is only proof that it might continue to work as a movie, as a drama, long after the events are in textbooks, and CBS is bought up by someone else. And so the world turns. Check this out. You won't be disappointed.\", \"Finally, now here is a movie where everybody seems to agree on the same verdict. It is a very rare occasion that most of the major critics, the Academy and myself all agree on the judgment of the quality of a motion picture. This only goes to say that this film really has to be good. It also goes to show that the best movies are almost always based on true stories. Truth always trumps fiction.  This movie was very well directed and well filmed, but above all it was well acted. Both Crowe and Pacino deliver memorable, believable performances, creating characters for which we can feel for, with whom we can identify. I agree on most of the Oscar Nominations, but I also feel that maybe an Oscar was warranted for best screenplay which is probably the best part of this motion picture.  Thumbs up!\", \"This is a movie that I was on the fence about seeing, simply because it seemed like just another movie about a whistle blower. It is so much more than that, and it is a movie worth watching time and again because of its complexity. It is about journalistic integrity, corporate greed, good vs. evil, and standing up for what you believe in, no matter what the cost. It pulls no punches about how far the tobacco industry would go to hide the truth from the American public about cigarettes, but it never seems propagandized.  Russell Crowe gives a top-notch performance of Everyman scientist Jeffrey Wigand that meets Al Pacino and Christopher Plummer's portrayals of 60 Minutes Hotshots Lowell Bergman and Mike Wallace frame by frame. These three actors have the perfect blend of chemistry and timing, and fit their characters like a glove. They completely inhabit their roles and at times it seems more like a documentary than a fictional story.  From beginning to end, it has the kind of edge of your seat tension that keeps one glued to the screen. Despite being a fairly lengthy film, it moves at a quick pace, and is absolutely riveting. The direction is superb, the camera angles are fast and furious, and it is a delight to watch.\", \"==This review contains what people might call spoilers=> I heard 'the Insider' was an 160 minute nail-biter of a true story that feels like half the time. What I saw was an interesting, slow moving character study that felt like twice the time.  The Insider is a film about that little incident where the tobacco industry had to pay like 250 billion to the people that it had caused damage to.  There is this critical interview in which an expert (Russell Crowe), formerly employed at a tobacco company, declares the executives of that company intentionally added some kind of substance to the cigarettes in order to have, and keep people addicted to the tobacco.  We all know the outcome of the story and still the director points the story in the direction where the interview will not be broadcast, which means the tobacco industry will get away with it. How can there be tension when the director tries to make you believe something which simply is not true? And after two and a half hours of manipulating the interview finally IS broadcast. Well what a surprise.  The package of 'the Insider' said -thriller-. It didn't work for me that way. What I saw was a slow, 160 minute, sometimes interesting, sometimes plain boring character study with (and this has to be said) some fabulous acting by Crowe and Pacino.  Do you want to see this? -rent 'the Insider'. You want excitement -stay away. ***1/2(out of five)\", \"SPOILERS THROUGH:   There is very little that I can add to many of the glowing reviews. I thought The Insider was incredible. Flawless from beginning to end. It's in the IMDb top 250 and small wonder. It was a superb movie.  There are so many elements in this movie that are fascinating. The journalistic issues. The issues of whistle blowing and doing the right thing. In my view both the main characters are heroes. The fact that this is based on a true story makes it that much more fascinating.  Pacino and Crowe both, in my opinion, gave flawless performances and both were excellent at drawing the viewer in(let me change that) SWEEPING the viewer in to their lives and the things they were fighting for. There are many movies that take on important issues but lack the ability to keep the movie interesting. That's not the case here as the movie literally simmers from start to finish and through the last hour or so, I don't think I moved. That's the type of film this is and it is absolutely outstanding.  This was one of the best roles I've seen Al Pacino in and though I have not seen a lot of Crowe's work, he is wonderful here and well cast.The supporting cast was wonderful too. There have been so many movies made about deception and dishonesty, it's nice to see a movie where the main characters are courageous and heroic. The Insider is all at once absorbing, disturbing, thought provoking and triumphant. In other words, it's everything a good movie should be.   This is a long movie but the time goes very quickly and it's not the type of movie that could have been any shorter. (It actually could have been even longer.) Everything from the acting to the camera work(some of it quite unusual) to the story itself is top notch and this is an example of a great film and that rare movie that myself and my film going friends can actually agree on. My vote is 10 of 10.\", \"Russell Crowe at his best as a Kentucky tobacco executive in Eric Roth and Michael Mann's masterpiece, \\\"The Insider,\\\" is one of the most underrated American films ever. Not only is it important historically for its political implications - not about tobacco, but about conflicts of commercial interest that control freedom of speech along the airwaves in the U.S.- it is a great story and it is true. Disney had no idea how to market \\\"The Insider\\\" and essentially sold it as tobacco movie and it is so much more. Pacino gives a grand A plus performance as a Long Island Jewish producer and halfway through the movie I forgot he was Al Pacino. Even better Christopher Plummer masterfully captures the full essence of Mike Wallace. Gina Gershon could turn lust from a stone as always. Michael Mann seems to always pull strong performances from his actors, and Eric Roth who brilliantly adapted \\\"Forrest Gump\\\" did the same here with Mann. Though long, \\\"The Insider\\\" is never boring and a movie all Americans should see twice to make sure they fully comprehend regardless of how you feel about the tobacco debate.\", \"From scene one, this film delivers a long slow burn as the tale of power and corruption unfolds. There is little action, but the film is steeped in an atmosphere of tension and high drama. The direction by Michael Mann is masterful, an object lesson in how to frame shots and let silence, as well as words - and music - work for the story. Al Pacino is once more the great actor of early films such as 'Scarecrow', instead of the theatrical performer of recent films. Russell Crowe shows his solid 'ordinary guy'character as more tortured through losing his family than any of the macho scenes he portrayed in 'Gladiator.' A superb film.\", \"\\\"The Insider\\\" in many ways reflects the golden days of American cinematography, where every scene serves a purpose, dialogue is sharp and poignant, and characters and events remain true to their emotions and nature.  The film presents certain questions throughout its duration that are intended to invoke thought in the viewer, and at the same time explores them to unprecedented depths which are by no means native to the film industry. The story is of a quick-paced nature, and demands that the viewer pay the utmost attention to every single line and image presented; it flabbergasts in its unparallelled structure of continuity and coherence to those sentient enough.  After watching this film, it became apparent why Crowe was so reluctant to play the role of Maximus in \\\"Gladiator\\\" after acting the part of Jeffrey Wigand. It appears more or less as if Crowe had been this character in reality, and it really inspires to see that such a talented actor is finally beginning to enjoy the prominence that he deserves.  In the past decades, there has been a progressive decline in the number of intelligent films making it onto the market, but the success of \\\"The Insider\\\" will hopefully serve as a shout-out to all the film companies and directors reluctant to tread on such sensitive ground. This movie could not receive a higher recommendation!\", \"Not always, but usually a Michael Mann-directed film means good things for movie buffs, and this is no exception.   Tremendous acting highlights this movie about a behind-the-scenes look at a \\\"60 Minutes\\\" story of a man who blows the whistle on a tobacco company. Al Pacino, as the TV show producer \\\"Lowell Bergman,\\\" Russell Crowe as the whistle-blower and tobacco scientist \\\"Dr. Jeffrey Wiegand,\\\" and Christopher Plummer as \\\"Mike Wallace\\\" all are riveting in their performances. They are intense characters, as are many of the supporting characters in this involving film.  There is little action in here but a ton of tension in the first hour of this long (158 min.) film. The story held my interest even when the tension left, thanks to the acting, the great cinematography, involving music score....well, just about everything. It's simply a well-done movie, similar to Mann's \\\"Heat,\\\" except without the violence.  The only negative was the obvious Liberal bias, but that's not surprising being it's about \\\"60 Minutes.\\\" I wasn't surprised when Ken Starr got a cheap shot, for example. This film bias could have been a lot more blatant so I'm not complaining. Obviously, they went a overboard in their stand against the tobacco industry, repeating the same damaging scenes over and over. However, I appreciated they didn't shrink from pointing out how the network was covering its own behind even though it was hurting its most successful program.  Photographer Dante Spinelli did an incredible job making this look fantastic despite the fact that there was no great scenery or exotic sets. As mentioned, this is just great film-making. What else can you say?\", \"THE INSIDER / (1999) **** (out of  \\\"The Insider\\\" prospers in almost every way, shape, and form possible. The production is a masterpiece of visual style, moving performances, and penetrating dialogue. The story is captivating, even at 157 minutes. There is more than enough unexpected plot twists to keep our attention throughout-and at a consistent pace. Many movies will have moments of inspiration and intrigue, but not \\\"The Insider.\\\" This movie is one long intriguing moment, a moment that is never boring or lacking. It is also believable and entirely convincing. There is a realistic look into the behavior of journalists and their desire for information. It is so intelligent about revealing the most important information little at a time, always at the perfect second.  Russell Crowe's character is the heart of the film, one of the most active protagonists seen in a movie all year. He plays Jeffrey Wigand, an ex-employee at Brown & Williamson, one of the nations largest cigarette manufacturers. Its chairman (Michael Gambon) has fired Wigand for questioning some of their potentially harmful research tactics and business routines-but not before blackmailing him into signing a strict confidentiality agreement that threatens his much needed severance package currently providing for his wife and their two young girls. When the company even further jeopardizes his existence, he blows his fuse and prepares to release information on the indecisive industry of B&W.  He gets his opportunity when Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), an ambitious and experienced reporter from the CBS news program \\\"60 Minutes,\\\" receives a package regarding product safety studies at another tobacco company. Bergman contacts Wigand, aspiring towards hiring him as a transitory consultant for a potential \\\"60 Minutes\\\" show. Bergman senses some vital information withheld in the knowledge of Wigand, therefore further investigates what he is making the executives at B&W so concerned.  The film makes many unexpected turns; in the second half, it smartly switches focus from Wigand to Bergman. After losing his privacy, secrets, reputation, and family, Wigand revealing startling facts and starts a new career teaching chemistry. But Bergman faces further complications. His TV Network refuses to air the segment because they could be sued big time for helping break Wigand's confidentiality agreement.  \\\"You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own f*****g confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets,\\\" explains Bergman.  The dialogue is one of the brightest, most thought-provoking material in the film. All of the little quirks in typical conversation are captured, the stuttering, the spontaneous explicit declaratives, and the sharp remarks that add a scathing zest to the character's personalities (Agent: Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand? Wigand: Yes. Yes, I do. I get extremely emotional when *******s put bullets in my mailbox!).  The movie's dramatic premise is so clear, so precise, so uncommonly absorbing. It expresses the true stress and nature of the traumatic emotions of the characters. There is also an excellent introduction of both Wigand and Bergman, giving them depth and human dimension. Despite a few members of my cinema discussion group disagree, I extensively enjoyed the piercing middle-eastern soundtrack consisting of awkward beats and fitting tones.  Al Pacino is cautious not to steal scenes from co-star Russell Crowe, but when his time comes he lets out a stark and involving performance. Crowe is worthy of his Oscar nomination for best actor; he delivers a performance of great subbtlness, but with an intense underlying tone of innovative depth and power. He captures all of the little tensions and stresses of his character, making his scenes involving, subversive, and taut.  Michael Mann is the film's director, who also directed the 1995 thriller \\\"Heat\\\" starring Val Kilmer, Robert De Niro, and Al Pacino. Here, he pays close attention to details; when a character pushes numbers on a pay phone, the camera captures the feeling-also hitting golf ball against a backdrop, dropping glasses on a table, and notably in an intense scene where two people fax each other important statements and questions. Mann also injects effective camera angles complete with slow motion photography, taking the view of the character, and close up shots.  \\\"The Insider\\\" inhabits a strong social message dealing with the influence of television, reputation, honesty, and so forth. The biggest ethic I think Mann is trying to get across is of modern morality: always do the right thing, follow you conscience, no matter what the cost. Then there's the film's most provoking issue: \\\"Fame has a fifteen-minute half-life. Infamy lasts a little longer.\\\"  \", \"The Insider is the only film I remember having seen where I walked out of the theatre with a headache because of the intensity of the story. Michael Mann is one of few directors who has such an in-depth understanding of both the subject of his film and the nature of that subject, that he is able to portray a realism that is nearly impossible to match.  There is real skill displayed in the way in which the Insider weaves through the aspects of both Bergmann and Wigand's lives. Whereas a lesser director would have thrown the characters at each other in an artificial collision, Mann introduces each character as being average professionals each living in their own respective stable lives. It is only when their chance encounter creates a subtext that could consume them both does the real chemical reaction in the story take place.  Bringing life to these fantastically written characters are two of the most talented 'big-name' character actors of our time, Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Surprisingly, it is Crowe that drives this film forward, and his portrayal of Wigand is spot-on perfect. His is an honest humanity, both a loving father and a flawed husband who never fully balances his life under the pressure of circumstance. Crowe nails the performance by not hamming-up the character, but rather by understating his personality. This works in that it is the character that is elevated while the actor disappears.  That is not to ignore the excellent work by the remainder of the cast. Pacino's performance is accented and accentuated beautifully by Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Mike Wallace. Most notably are several standout scenes mixing Pacino, Plummer, Philip Baker Hall and Stephen Tobolowsky that ground the underlying tensions of the film fantastically. And the juxtaposition between the cold, hard New York settings and the organic nature of Mississippi further press this film beyond standard non-fiction works.  Easily one of the best dramas of 1999, the Insider is a standout member of that elite club of great historical dramas such as All the President's Men that are few and far between. It is for that audience that appreciates skilled performances meeting skilled direction and restrained, mature writing.\", \"I'll make this simple for you with short attention spans: Al Pacino's best performance of the 90s. Russell Crowe's best work on par with LA Confidential (if not better) and a gripping shot by Christopher Plummer as 60 Minutes anchor Mike Wallace.  For those who can handle it, read on:  Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) has been fired from his job. He has to break the news to his wife (Diane Venora, who I believe should go on to be one of the best actresses of all time) that their beautiful home, swank cars and health care plan (their oldest daughter is athsmatic) are about to go down the tubes. He's been given a severance package but that's about to fall apart as well.  Enter Lowell Bergman (Pacino), producer for CBS Television News' bastion of journalistic integrity, 60 Minutes. Bergman's doing a report on fires that were started by careless smokers and has been given a report so huge and full of technical jargon he can't make heads or tales of it. Through a friend he is put in touch with Wigand in the hopes of finding a translator. Wigand thinks Lowell is coming after him because of what he knows about his former employers, a major tobacco company.  It is at this moment that director Michael Mann institutes a trick, the likes of which hasn't been seen since All The President's Men. The two exchange a cat-and-mouse conversation via fax. Bergman finally calls Wigand's bluff by daring him to meet him the next day. He does.  What does Wigand know? Well, its all over the papers these days about how the tobacco industry lied about manipulating the leaves to make them more habit forming. We have Wigand to thank for that. But that isn't where the story ends. This is a two-fold tale; on one hand you have the self-destruction of a man who put everything on the line just so he could do the right thing. On the other, you have a television producer who so believes in the integrity of himself, the network, and his show that he is willing to risk everything he has to fight for the protection of his source. I haven't seen this much commitment outside of Woodward and Berstein's staunch protection of \\\"Deep Throat.\\\"  The trump card of this film though comes in the form of Christopher Plummer playing one of the most visible news figures of the past 25 years, Mike Wallace. Wallace teeters on the edge of looking like a foul-mouthed, celebrity hungry, media hound who's only thought is about ratings. However, before its over, he evokes the \\\"integrity of Edward R. Murrow,\\\" a line that gave me chills and made me pray for an Oscar Nomination.  Director Michael Mann is known chiefly for his Action/Thrillers. This 155 minute film is slow paced but gripping for ever second it is on the screen. A lot of people have complained over the past 7-8 years about Pacino's \\\"staccato\\\" performances, suddenly shouting at the slightest provocation. This film returns him to his prime form, a style he hasn't walked in since Dog Day Afternoon, ...And Justice For All and Serpico.

Pitt \\\"nails\\\" his character which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller. A good watch for those into psycho-killer flix.\", \"So-so thriller starring Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, who join David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a road trip out west. The latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book; Pitt's a serial killer on the lam (unbeknownst to Dave) and Juliette is his poor, not-all-there companion. This is a good cast and the story moves along, but Pitt isn't belivably scary as a serial killer, although it is one of his better earlier roles. The best thing is here is Michelle Forbes, who always manages to shine, whether in her roles on `Homicide: Life on the Street' or in the brief series `Wonderland.'  Vote: 6\", \"\\\"Kalifornia\\\"is a great film that makes us look at ourselves.The film has a great cast,Brad Pitt(Johnny Suede,A River Runs Through It,and The Legends Of The Fall)as Early Grayce,David Duchovny(The X Files)as Brian Kessler,Michelle Forbes(Star Trek:The Next Generation,Homicide:Life On The Street,and Escape From L.A.)as Carrie Loughlin,Brian's girlfriend,and Juliette Lewis(Natural Born Killers,Cape Fear,and What's Eating Gilbert Grape)as Adele Corners,Early's girlfriend.  Brian Kessler is a writer who is a Liberal,is getting ready to write a book about serial killers.Brian and his girlfriend,Carrie decide they want to move to California,so Brian places an ad at the college for some who wants to go to California,to share expenses on the trip.  Early Grayce is an ex con and sociopath on parole,who recently lost his job at the mirror factory in town,is in debt,owes his landlord money.Early's parole officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job.Early goes to the college and sees the ad,he later tells Adele,his girlfriend about leaving to go to California.Early and Adele meet Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and leave town.Brian and Carrie do not know that he is a killer who just killed his landlord.For a little while Brian and Carrie thought of Early and Adele different but got to know them and become sort of friends,Carrie and Adele become real good friends.  Their journey is a very learning one.Though Brain and Carrie not knowing early is a killer till later on in the movie.The question Brian asks in this film about the difference between killers and us is a very good question.Early Grayce is a sociopath who doesn't see the error of his ways,goes down hill later on and pays the price.  This film is a great movie,I give it 10/10 stars and 2 thumbs up.I love the songs in the movie,especially at the end of the film,the song\\\"Look Up To The Sky\\\"by The Indians.\", \"David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young journalist couple who want to go to California, but can't really afford to, so they 'ride share\\\" with another young couple (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save on expenses. The idea is for them to stop at various murder sites along the way, sites where serial killers did their thing, since Brian (Duchovny) is a writer and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. What they don't know is that Pitt (Earley) and Lewis are serial killer and girlfriend who just goes along with whatever HE says. I don't care for Pitt as a rule but he does justice to psycho roles. The scary thing is that he does them so well; I've actually KNOWN people like him before, no, not killers, but with pretty much the same mindset. Anyway, as the road trip goes along, Carrie guesses that the others are about out of money, but Earley seems to always come up with the cash somehow....never mind that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though. Lewis does her role well, one that she excels at, a not-too-bright waif that has a good heart but doesn't understand that she doesn't have to put up with being beaten up by Earley when she does something he doesn't like. As things begin to get more unacceptable Carrie insists that the other couple be put out at a gas station, and unfortunately it's at that point where she's inside that she sees a news bulletin that tells her exactly who they've been ride-sharing with, after which things go downhill for them at a rapid clip. This is not the greatest flick in the world, but it's not bad...I watched what was supposed to be the 'unrated' version but I wonder how much was cut out of the rated version, because this seemed fairly tame to me, really...not that this makes it family fare or anything, unless it's maybe the Manson Family. 7 out of 10.\", \"I have to start off by apologizing because I thought the first 75-80% of this film was hilarious. It's mostly because of Brad Pitt's performance. Spot on.  The acting by all involved was quite good but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in all respects. I'm not a giant Pitt fan but this has got to be one of his best roles ever.  Brutal,Honest,Gritty. All good words to describe this movie.  I was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind Early's violence isn't explained. It is explained but they thankfully don't have to go into graphic detail to get their point across.  Overall I gave this a 9 because every scene bar 1 or 2 was effective. I think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie. Underrated.\", \"This movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to out act the performance he gave in this movie. Duchovny was top notch, as was Forbes and Lewis. The 4 main characters embark on a scenic road tour of historic murder sites, in one of the coolest cars ever made, 1960's model Lincoln Continental. Early Grace is a simpleton with a taste for dry toothbrushes and carnage. He likes his women to not curse or smoke, and wear PWT dresses. Duchovny and Forbes are a pair of artists from the city, while Early and Lewis are Trailer parkers from the rural outskirts. Even though the majority tone in the film is dark, there are plenty of funny scenes to be had. The writing, directing, and acting are brilliant. If you like road movies, murder, humor, and narration, watch this film. Everyone delivers, and you will want more when the credits roll. One of my all time favorites. \\\"hey...shave that dog n teach it to hunt!\\\"\", \"I can't say too much about Kalifornia as sadly I have yet to actually see the whole thing (I've only managed to see it in bits and pieces on Fuse.) But what I have seen is absolutely awesome! I am a fan of Brad Pitt but I admit not all his earlier movies are well good. But this role, I just, his acting is great, his character Early seems so normal well okay creepy, dark weird but you know normal for a hillbilly of that type I guess. And Juliette Lewis's performance although I can see how some may be annoyed by it I think it's amazing. Sadly I have yet to see the end, but from reading other reviews on here it sounds good, but disappointing. I have to admit that I wish David Duchovany's (sorry if the spelling on that is incorrect) was a bit flat but for him it was okay. His wife's character was better, and I thought her performance while not the best in the movie was pretty good, a portrait of the avant-Gard/older sister type. Particularly the scene where Early and Brian go to play pool, and Adele and Carrie are having their one on one time together. I've watched that scene at least twice now and I still think the acting in it is just wonderful. One because of the emotion that Adele portrays after talking about being raped by the three guys and how she feels about Early and Carrie's reaction to it. Everything about that I think is just so perfect. I mean, maybe it's because I can relate a bit, I'm not sure.   As for Brad Pitt who plays the serial killer that we actually get to see for once; I thought he was great. Some movies with Pitt that I've seen were just average or not worth seeing. I don't think I've ever seen a terrible Pitt movie or if I have it's not because of his acting it's other factors. This movie was not one of them. He turned out a great performance in Kalifornia. I swear I'm not just some random I do like him for his acting not just because he's good looking, I mean his character in this movie isn't exactly handsome or cute by any means! Pitt is dark, brooding and downright scary at times. Yet he's also cheerful, funny, nice, and even loving towards Adele. Granted there are some spots that made me want to reach through the TV and strangle him but that's probably just me (and the character Pitt played in the movie.) But it also shows how good Pitt's acting was in this movie it made me forget that he was playing a character, that is what good acting is supposed to do.   At any rate I wish I could say more, but that's all I can really say without having seen the ending, I have seen most of the movie through what I've caught on Fuse and as I'm writing this I'm taping it on DVR so hopefully I can write a more complete review later. I just wanted to share my thoughts on a movie that I thought was something really cool and something that seems to have gotten overlooked (it shouldn't have!)\", \"A surprisingly effective thriller, this.  David Duchovny and Michelle 'Ensign Ro' Forbes are a successful, professional couple, he a writer, she a photographer. Forbes is desperate to move to California and, in an act of compromise, Mulder agrees to the move on the condition that, along the way, they visit sites of historical interest concerning famous serial killers. His idea: he writes the words, she takes the pictures, with the end result a bestselling coffee table book that will set them up for life. To help finance the trip, they decide to car share and advertise the fact. As their bad luck would have it Brad Pitt sees the advert and, shortly after killing his landlord, he and his girlfriend, Juliette Lewis, meet the writer couple and begin their cross country trek. Inevitably, mischief ensues.  Pitt is outstanding as the genuinely chill inspiring Early Grayce and is capably backed up by Lewis playing her customary white trash character that seems to be her default setting. Duchovny and Forbes make for a convincing double act too and, as events spiral out of control, you as the viewer are sucked into their plight and can feel the tension ratcheting.  Intelligent, sinister and beautifully shot, this deserves recognition beyond its current status. A top movie.\", \"This Was One Scary Movie.  Brad Pitt Deserved an Oscar for this.  A traveling novelist (played by David Duchovny of the X-Files fame) and his girlfriend pick up two hitch-hikers(Juliette Lewis and Brad Pitt) on their way to California.   On their way they stop at infamous serial killer murder scenes to photography the scenes for an upcoming book Duchovny's character is working on, little do they know that the most disturbed serial killer in the history of the country is sitting right next to them in the same car.\", \"**** = A masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten  ***1/2 = A classic in time; simply a must see  *** = A solid, worth-while, very entertaining piece  **1/2 = A good movie, but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws  ** = May still be considered good in areas, but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable (e.g., genre)  *1/2 = Mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile moments  BOMB = Not of a viewable quality  - Kalifornia = ***  - Unrated (for strong violent material, considerable sexuality, and language)  I rented this film expecting an in-your-face summer-Blockbuster-quality celebration of Brad Pitt's face, but was happily surprised and disappointed. This really is more of a drama, and very grim at that... I remember some emotionally intense Duchovny voice-overs.  Pitt plays out his possibly un-sexiest film ever with startling talent. Who started out as a hopeless yet harmless \\\"white trash\\\" husband became realized as a violent, disturbing alcoholic with a messed mind. During some of the latter stages in the film, I found it hard to keep watching him - he was unpredictable and scary. This proves very good writing and acting.  The whole movie is filled with bizarre, sensational scenes that made me hold my breath not fewer than once, and I don't mean action scenes. I mean dialogue scenes so brilliantly crafted I actually winced and gasped at what I was seeing. It was like watching a rhino and a lion put in a cage and watching as they gnawed each other to death. Again, I am very impressed with the screenwriter(s); whoever they are did the impossible: mixed oil and water.  I also very much enjoyed Juliette Lewis's performance. It is so rare for this talented young actress to make an appearance these days that when she does it is such a joy. Some of her moments in this film brought me to tears. I mean that. The emotions this girl can arouse in your head are incredible, and I clearly remember getting blurry-eyed on a few occasions.  I almost feel like I'm cheating the quality craftsmanship the film makers have displayed by only giving \\\"KALIFORNIA\\\" a *** rating. But the dark feelings that it stirs are too potent and depressing to raise it. I do believe that everyone should see this movie though. I truly do.\", \"I had seen this film many years ago and it had made a lasting impression on me. Alas, I have hardened to many films over the years and did not expect to be impressed by 'Kalifornia' upon watching again recently. I am pleased to say that it is every bit as unnerving and watchable as it was ten or so years ago.  There are two things which really give this movie its power. The first is its cast. We have a staggeringly disturbing turn by a young Brad Pitt as Early Grace. Knowing Pitt, as we all do, as one of the most enduring heart-throbs Hollywood has ever had, it is refreshing to see him play such a vile, unattractive character. Pitt pulls the show off without resorting to white-trash clich\\u00e9 or parody, and manages to remain genuinely terrifying throughout the movie.  Juliette Lewis is equally impressive as Grace's tragic girlfriend, playing the character like a ten year old girl with a forty year old's life experience. Lewis manages to evoke pity (for her character's station in life) as well as contempt (for her naivety), but she underpins her performance with the kind of subtlety rarely seen by an actor so young. Personally, I think it's a tragedy that neither Pitt nor Lewis were nominated for any awards for their performances here.  David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes are both perfectly cast as the yuppy couple who unwittingly end up travelling across the US with Pitt and Lewis. Duchovony is aptly geeky and naive, and Forbes seems emphatically cynical and shut-off, but both actors manage to convincingly portray their characters' changes as they are equally intrigued, repulsed and strangely attracted to Pitt.  The fine casting and uniformly brilliant acting aside, this film really grabs us by the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing. At the time 'Kalifornia' was released, Hollywood was releasing a slew of nice-character-turns-out-to-be-psychotic movies ('Single White Female', 'Pacific Heights', 'The Hand That Rocks The Cradle', 'Deceived', 'Sleeping With The Enemy' etc). Most of these movies followed the same formula, the only variation being the nature of the relationship between good guy and bad guy. 'Kalifornia' doesn't really stray too far from this territory, but its first two acts are the perfect example of the slow-boil thriller, and we are kept on the very edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn.  When the penny does drop, and Pitt is let loose to play the maniacal bad guy, the film shifts gears completely and the last twenty minutes don't quite live up to rest of the movie. That said, the action is thick and fast and the resolution is suitable cold. The fight is over, but the scars will always be there.  Much of the narration (provided by a somewhat whiny, pre X-files Duchovony) is a tad contrived. Of course, it's meant to be from the book the Duchovony's journalist character has written, so one could argue that the self-conscious narration is meant to be a nod to the kind of sensationalised style in which most journalists write.  The film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above 90% of the thrillers of the past twenty years. Highly recommended, but not for the weak of stomach or mind. This film is disturbing on more than one level. But then, it's meant to be.\", \"In 1990 Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis did a TV Too Young To Die where both played the almost the same kind of parts that they do in Kalifornia. I have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen film.  Kalifornia finds aspiring writer David Duchovny and his girl friend, art photographer Michelle Forbes on a rocky relationship of sorts due to Duchovny's obsession with writing a book and getting in the minds and souls of serial killers. In fact he's got a most unusual odyssey planned, he wants to go cross country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers. But he and Forbes are flat broke.  Fate intervenes in more ways than financial with the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis a pair of strange southern types who agree to split the cost of gas on this cross country trip. It turns out Pitt is a serial killer himself and he decides to do a little research on his own, delving into the mind of someone who is fascinated with amorality.  Kalifornia is not the type of film I usually go for, but in fact the acting ability and charisma of Brad Pitt make it work to a large degree. Pitt is the walking definition of an inbred Gothic refugee from Deliverance. But better than he is is Juliette Lewis who once again is playing these low self esteem types which she seems to do well. Watch her scene with Forbes as she does her hair and Lewis describes her sad and pathetic life. Lewis's dialog and Forbes's reactions ought to be shown in acting classes around the country.  For those who like their slasher flicks, they don't come better than Kalifornia.\", \"If this is supposed to be a portrayal of the American serial killer, it comes across as decidedly average.  A journalist [Duchovny] travels across country to California to document America's most famous murderers, unaware that one of his white trailer trash travelling companions [Pitt] is a serial killer himself.  Rather predictable throughout, this has its moments of action and Pitt and Lewis portray their roles well, but I'd not bother to see it again.\", \"Kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals. A journey on the darkest road ever. The road of no return. The plot is about a couple that set out to find a better life in California. The man (David Duchovny in his best role up to now) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that have happened in America and his girl - who is a photographer - is going to take the pictures. So they set out on a trail of famous murders not knowing what awaits them on the way. To share the journey expenses they decide to find another couple and they put an ad. But the couple that answers it is not just ANY couple. It is one of the strangest couples ever. The girl is a naive, frail creature that dreams a lot and loves cactuses. The man is exactly the opposite. A cruel ruthless murderer. We learn that early in the film and we follow him along the journey to Kalifornia (not with C as usual, but with K, presumably symbolizing the word killer), along his journey of betrayal, murder and finally defeat. All the leads, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes give really good performances and you have to take into consideration that when this movie was filmed not even one of them was a star. The photography is amazing, with darkness covering the greatest parts of the movie, and the music suits the dark character of the film. On the whole this is a really good movie. Don't miss it. You'll think again before taking some stranger in your car to share the gas with!\", \"I bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to watch it until last night. I do like Juliette Lewis although I'm indifferent to Brad Pitt. After this viewing I have to admit he's a perfectly fine actor - his character was entirely believable, and I didn't think \\\"Brad Pitt\\\" at all.  Unfortunately I can't say the same for David Duchovny. I'm an X-Files fan and I had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie, as I'd thought it was made a few years later. I like Duchovny but found his character a little two-dimensional here, except where he's doing voice-overs. That part was strong, seemed in character, good intonation, etc. Otherwise I kept thinking \\\"Agent Mulder\\\", which is a pity.  Michelle Forbes was a treat. Why haven't I noticed her before? (I'll be looking up to see what other roles she's done and seeing those asap) I am slightly concerned about stereotyping re Lewis, this film, and \\\"Natural Born Killers\\\" (a firm favourite). Interesting though to see a contrast of characters - in NBK she's a willing accomplice, whereas here she abhors the violence and tries very hard not to acknowledge Early's dark side until it's thrust in her face.  I enjoyed this film almost unreservedly. Apart from Duchovny's character not seeming fully-formed (and perhaps being \\\"washed out\\\" somewhat by Pitt's), it was perfect. I was also pleased with the ending - glad that the innocent heroes did not die, yet they had to suffer first. It was realistic, tense, disturbing.  If you like NBK you may well like this movie, and vice-versa.\", \"Kalifornia is the story of a writer and his girlfriend photographer who are looking for someone to help pay gas money and take turns at the wheel for a cross country road trip to famous murder sights. Ironically a serial killer and his girlfriend answer the post. Kalifornia is a diamond in the rough and a very intriguing journey with a serial killer. Great performances all around by the leads with Pitt in particular being exceptional. Check it out!!\", \"Kalifornia came out in 1993, just as 3 of the 4 lead characters were up and coming to the levels of fame they now possess in 2006. This is a nice psycho-thriller that should appeal to all David Duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent narratives that find their ways into his work, like with most of his episodes of the X-Files, Playing God, and Red Shoe Diaries.  People who were put off by the heavy southern accent from Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis' characters obviously have never spent much time in the south. For every \\\"Brian and Carrie\\\" in the south, there is an \\\"Adele and Early\\\" and in 2006, that's the real horror of this flick.  Aside from that, I think the film was written with a cult film intention - like with Carrie's photography, it's not suitable for mass consumption. But if you have a copy of this in your personal library, I think it says something positive about your tastes for freaky movies.\", \"I had seen 'Kalifornia' before (must be about 10 years ago) and I still remember to be very impressed by it. That's why I wanted to see it again and all I can say is that it still hasn't lost its power, even though I'm used to a lot more when it comes to movies than that I was ten years ago.  'Kalifornia' tells the tale of the writer Brian Kessler and his girlfriend Carrie Laughlin, a photographer, who want to move to California. But instead of stepping on a plain and flying right to the state where they say it never rains, they choose to make a trip by car. He wants to write a book about America's most famous serial killers and she will make the matching pictures. But because their car uses an enormous amount of petrol, they decide to take another couple with them, so they can spread the costs of the trip. Only one couple has answered the add, so they will automatically be the lucky ones. But they haven't met each other yet and when seeing the other couple for the first time, when their trip has already started, Carrie is shocked. Without wanting to be prejudiced, she can only conclude that Early Grayce and Adele Corners are poor white trailer park trash. She definitely doesn't want them in her car, but Brian doesn't really mind to take them with them and decides to stop and pick them up anyway. At first the couple doesn't seem to be that bad after all, but gradually Early Grayce changes from a trashy hillbilly into a remorseless murderer...  Not only is the story very impressive, so is the acting from our four leads. Brad Pitt is incredible as Early Grayce. His performance in this movie may well be his best ever. The same for Juliette Lewis. She plays the childish and naive girlfriend that doesn't want to hear a bad word about her Early and does that really very well. But David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes are a surprise as well. They both did a very good job and I really wonder why we never heard anything from Forbes again since this movie, because she really proves to have a lot of talent.  Overall this is a very good and impressive psychological thriller with a very powerful story, but because of the graphic violence, I can imagine that it may not be to everybody's taste (although I don't really see another way how to portray a serial killer in a believable way). Personally I really liked this movie a lot and the violence never bothered me (it's a part of the story that's too important to be left out). I reward this movie with an 8/10.\", \"I just got done watching \\\"Kalifornia\\\" on Showtime for the fourth time since I first saw it back in July of 2001. You would think that with the recent wave of serial killer films, that \\\"Kalifornia\\\" would be amongst some of the earlier films worthy of mention but hasn't. Perhaps if this film had been released sometime between like 1996-1999, maybe it might have been more successful. In my opinion, \\\"Kalifornia\\\" is much different from most serial killer films released during the late 1990s. It has an almost completely different atmosphere from most of today's serial killer films like \\\"Seven\\\" or \\\"The Bone Collector\\\". Many serial killer films have shown a killer but that person is always behind a mask or we never see enough of them to actually learn anything about them. \\\"Kalifornia\\\" is a film that actually tries to break through that barrier and actually understand the criminal mind. It tries to answer questions like \\\"why do they do the things they do? Is it because of something that happened in their past? Does it make them feel superior or powerful? Or do they do it because they like the thrill of the kill?\\\" These are some of the things that \\\"Kalifornia\\\" tries to answer but also leaves room for us to try and figure things out for ourselves. Brad Pitt makes an everlasting impression as Early Grayce. When we first meet Early in the beginning of the film, we see that he is obviously one disturbed individual. When we first see him, it's late at night. Early is possibly drunk. We then see him pick up a rock, throw it off a bridge, and it later lands on the windshield of a passing car. Pitt is fierce in this film. It is always good to see him when he plays psychos or really bad people. It's funny that this would later lead him play a true loon like in \\\"12 Monkeys\\\" and that he would be on the other end of the spectrum in David Fincher's \\\"Seven\\\".\", \"it's amazing that so many people that i know haven't seen this little gem. everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction: WHAT A GREAT MOVIE!!  i've never much cared for Brad Pitt (though his turns in 12 monkeys and Fight Club show improvement) but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving, dark and right on target.  everyone else in the film gives excellent performances and the movie's slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings. the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really happening.  the only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book, is that compared to what came before it, the ending is a bit too long and overblown. but that's the only flaw i could find in this cult classic.  if you check this film out, try to get the letterboxed unrated director's cut for the best viewing option.  rating:9\", \"\\\"Kalifornia\\\" is one of my all-time favourite movies, and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90`s. The film has a very stylish surface to it, but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others. One of the film`s strongest aspects is it`s performances, Brad Pitt is startlingly great as a trailer-trash psycho named Early. Pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly. Juliette Lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend, her innocence is almost heart-breaking. \\\"Kalifornia\\\" has a very simple plot to it, that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour, but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder, as Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are alot of shocking scenes, and it all mounts to a power-house climax that will haunt you for days. \\\"Kalifonia\\\" is a film that should really be watched for it`s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be, and not only for it`s violence and gore.\", \"In the same vein as Natural Born Killers, another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that I also loved, Kalifornia is a movie that clearly glamorizes violence, but I like to think that it turns that around in the final act. Kind of like how The Basketball Diaries glamorizes drugs at first, but shows the bad side by the end of the movie, which is far worse than the good side is good. David Duchovny plays Brian Kessler, an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend, who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for, I don't know where, places where nudity passes for art. Maybe it really does and I just don't understand it. At any rate, Brian and Carrie (Duchovny and Michelle Forbes, who fits the role flawlessly), make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites. Brian, the writer, will write the book, Carrie can take the pictures.  Being artistic types, Brian and Carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip, so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses, and are contacted by Early Grace and Adele Corners (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis). Early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer, sees the ad on a bulletin board, and decides to leave the state for a while, violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlord's murder so he won't have to deal with a pesky murder investigation. Two birds with one stone, you know.  The movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes, the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash, without resorting to clich\\u00e9s or even ending up with caricatures of either type. Brian and Carrie are artsy liberals, but while Carrie catches on to Early and Adele, Brian is fascinated with Early's status as an outlaw, as seen in the scene where Brian shoots Early's gun. Never having fired a gun before, he's as fascinated as a little kid. While Adele and Carrie are back at a hotel and Adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that Early \\\"broke her\\\" of smoking and that she's not allowed to drink (Early doesn't think women should), Early and Brian are out at the local bar. Brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him, and Early first gives advice to Brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy. \\\"Hit him, Bri, it's comin'.\\\" This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie, partly because it's so funny what Early gleefully says as the guy's friends drag him away, bloodied and battered, but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel, we learn so much all at once about the two couples, their differences, and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them. And besides that, because Brian benefited from Early's actions and Carrie is appalled by what she hears from Adele, it also illustrates the different way that Carrie and Brian react to Early and Adele.  Clearly, by now, you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller, where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues. On one hand it seems a little too convenient that Brian and Carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer, but on the other hand it's a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a cross-country trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes. While studying the actions of past murderers, Brian and Carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying, and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when it's in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders past.  I am constantly amazed at Brad Pitt's versatility as an actor. Consider, for example, his roles in movies like Kalifornia, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, and Ocean's 11 and 12. Pitt is like Tom Hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character, and is completely believable. Incidentally, I tried in vain to be Early Grace for Halloween this year, but just couldn't get the hair and beard right. I even got the hat right, which initially I thought would be the hardest part.  It's easy to understand why a lot of people disliked Kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder, but I think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audience's understanding of its subject matter. A film that didn't glorify violence, at least initially, could never be as effective as Kalifornia, but the movie structures it perfectly. The glorification is all embodied in Brian's and Carrie's fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened, but their realization, and ours, is embodied in the real thing, which they encounter with Early and Adele. The movie's very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real.\", \"it's amazing that so many people that i know haven't seen this little gem. everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction: WHAT A GREAT MOVIE!!  i've never much cared for Brad Pitt (though his turns in 12 monkeys and Fight Club show improvement) but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving, dark and right on target.  everyone else in the film gives excellent performances and the movie's slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings. the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really happening.  the only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book, is that compared to what came before it, the ending is a bit too long and overblown. but that's the only flaw i could find in this cult classic.  if you check this film out, try to get the letterboxed unrated director's cut for the best viewing option.  rating:9\", \"It's a road movie, with a killer on-board. Brian Kessler (David Duchovny), a sophisticated, urbane writer, wants to conduct field research on American serial killers. But, neither he, nor his girlfriend, Carrie (Michelle Forbes), has the money for a cross-country tour of murder sites, so they advertise for someone to share travel expenses. Who they end up with is a young couple, Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend, Adele (Juliette Lewis), two better examples of \\\"poor white trash\\\" you will never find in all of cinema.  Indeed, Early and Adele are what make this film so entertaining, as they babble, cackle, confide, muse, speculate, drool, and otherwise behave in ways I haven't seen since reruns of \\\"The Beverly Hillbillies\\\". Early's idea of California: \\\"People think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather; cold weather makes people stupid\\\". That's enough to convince Adele: \\\"I guess that explains why there are so many stupid people around here\\\". To which Early responds proudly: \\\"It sure does\\\". Early continues to instruct Adele about California: \\\"You never have to buy no fruit, on account it's all on the trees ... and they ain't got no speed limits, and I hear your first month's rent is free, state law\\\".  But poor Early has some, well, mental problems, which become ever more obvious to Brian and Carrie as the four travelers proceed west across the U.S. As they enter the desert Southwest, with its beautifully stark landscape, \\\"Kalifornia\\\" starts to look more and more like \\\"The Hitcher\\\" (1986), and Early starts to act more and more like John Ryder, everyone's maniacal hitchhiker, whose terror seemed so unstoppable.  In \\\"Kalifornia\\\", the acting is uneven. Duchovny's performance is flat. Brad Pitt is surprisingly effective, despite his overacting at times. Michelle Forbes is great as the avant-garde, photographic artist. But my choice for best performance goes to Juliette Lewis. With her nasal voice and heavy-duty Southern accent, she is stunning, as the naive, highly animated, child-like Adele.  Toward the end, the film takes on a Twilight Zone feel to it, as our travelers enter a Nevada nuclear test site with a dilapidated old house full of test mannequins. The plot dissolves rather messily into unnecessary and preposterous violence, an ending that was somewhat disappointing.  Overall, however, \\\"Kalifornia\\\" is an entertaining film, thanks to a clever concept, great scenery, especially in the second half, good cinematography, great dialogue, and that wonderful performance by Juliette Lewis.\", \"Another movie to suffer without an adventure to run, no enigma to solve. Just an illness man, acting like an animal. No a good reason to take this journey. Pitt and Lewis are great actors; magnificent Michelle Forbes but a weak David Duchovny performance...\", \"In an interview, David Duchovny said he hasn't been able to watch even the first hour of this film - and neither should you. The scene where he asks the owner of a house where a murder was committed if he can look around - change the name he gives and he could had lifted his performance from just about any episode of the X-Files. He's on autopilot for the whole film. Brad Pitt overacts appallingly.\", \"Distasteful, cliched thriller has young couple doing cross-country research on America's most infamous murder sites, becoming road partners with a dim-witted young woman and her snarling boyfriend--who is an actual psycho. Arty and alienating, the film's tone alternates between pouty pseudo-irony and silly flamboyance. Handsomely-made perhaps, but ultimately laughable. Brad Pitt's performance as the low-rent killer is godawful. * from ****\", \"I was expecting to love this movie--film noir, serial killer, dark irony. I was baffled by many choices the characters made (\\\"Hey, I know they're creepy looking, but let's hook up for a cross-country road trip anyway!\\\"), found the pacing to be glacial, and the emphasis on moody lighting to take the place of original thought by the director and cinematographer.  Thinking about it now, this would have been a much better movie if someone had just run the script through the common sense-o-meter (1992 model) before starting to film...\", \"honestly, if anyone has a brain, there's not 1 positive thing  to say about this movie what so ever.   I lost my $1 renting this. I'd rather laugh at Will Smith saying \\\"If you got a dream, you got to protect it\\\".   all the actors must've been bored or had no fame at the time. even Matthew Mc Conahay *however you spell it* was better then all the actors in this movie, when he played a psycho in Texas Chainsaw 4.

I especially resent this type of emotional manipulation when it tries to make a greater statement about our present day criminal justice system through questionable comparisons. The movie's premise is an interesting one and I think we would all agree that constitutional rights need to be protected but, at the end of the day, this movie is just another sappy, preachy Spielberg movie.

There is no \\\"minority report\\\". Rather there is an echo. There is no sympathetic character, only a world devoid of any redeeming characteristics. Craft maybe high but the story is totally lacking. Why is Spielberg so fascinated by the loss of children? How do you justify motivations covering 6 years? Why do the plots have to be transparent? Why does the movie drag on? Watch it without the thought that this was done by the same man who gave us Jaws, ET, Indie etc. Even the best directors often run dry, Kubrick for one.

Spielberg proves he's completely inadequate to take on the nuances and depth of the source material with his flash-but-no-substance approach.

The script is pretty good and could have been made into a fabulous film in the hands of a capable director like Soderbergh.

After seeing those three you may never be in the mood to see another movie again.\", \"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Getting the introductions out of the way, it is 2054 in Washington D.C. and Tom Cruise plays, John Anderton, a Precrime enforcement detective who heads up a crack team specializing in preventing murders before they occur, also arresting criminals before they kill. Out of the loop, the cops come calling in the form of Colin Farrell's character, Detective Witwer who backs Anderton into a corner, seizing control of the experimental operation and taking control of Precrime's affairs. Through the minds of three precognitive and abnormally gifted youths who, when asleep, dream only of murder in technologically projected second sight, Anderton sees his own criminal fate and sets out to alter his unknown predestination.  Estranged from his wife and a father struggling to cope with the disappearance of his son, Anderton seeks a temporary high in the dark world of illegal street drugs but when his murderous number comes down the pipe, both the law and Precrime chart a course for his apprehension before he kills. In a highly advanced and technologically sound society, Anderton goes on the run in search of the truth behind the world's most advanced crime unit and a precognitive flaw in its design know as a \\\"Minority Report.\\\"  After seeing the trailers, I immediately thought A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) meets Mission Impossible and, for the most part, that's exactly what it is. However, it's much more the former rather than latter. Although I'm still spinning from the theatrical experience, I essentially see Minority Report as an extension of Spielberg's previous Kubrick inspired interpretation. Visually interchangeable with both worlds in its visual presentation, Minority Report most definitely shares the same headspace as A.I... which isn't a bad thing at all. Based on a short story by acclaimed science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, the underlying subtext is equally complex as the film looms heavy in theme, tackling such debatable issues as divinity versus science, the right to life, God's will, man's innate feeling of superiority, and our preoccupation with technology.  Visually, Minority Report is awesome. Although this similarity may seem strange, it's very much a case of the future catching up with the past, as Steven Spielberg is most certainly the Tiger Woods of filmmaking. You'd tend to think people get soft as they grow older but with regard to Spielberg's last two films, the director continues to, not only, challenge himself with complex subject matter but also reinvent himself as a director at the same time. Hell, amid the dazzling imagery and computer-generated eye-candy, Spielberg even takes to a few-held shots, jumping back into the days of Guerilla filmmaking to set the appropriate tone.  Set fifty-two years ahead of us in 2054, the seamless blend of CGI used to create the future Washington is staggering and strikingly impressive. Unlike many preceding and recent science fiction films, Minority Report is a unique identity all to its own. In creating such an invigorating visual world, as previously mentioned, Spielberg's vision is very similar to A.I. in both structure and spacecraft, but the limitations of the film's 21st Century setting only helps to demystify the unknown, making society much more familiar while also giving the audience an identifiable future to look into. All cityscapes and highway sequences are both astonishing and highly innovative, somehow proving to push the envelope of the science fiction genre itself.  Much to my surprise and Spielberg's credit, the film sticks religiously (no symbolic reference intended) to Anderton's immediate world, which of course is filled with a lot of cool eye candy and technologically advanced gadgetry. A very creative look at what the future may have in store for us, society is ripe with eye identification scanners and interactive advertising (which is very cool). including song and dance cereal box characters that look a lot like those Mini-Wheat guys. A hot topic especially in the last decade, holographic imagery comes to life, preserving Anderton's family memories in transparent 3-D files. To say the least, Spielberg has crafted a very dark but believable future with a grounded sense of realism that's not too far fetched given some of today's strides in modern advancement.  Having proven himself to be more than just a pretty face with performances in Jerry Maguire and Magnolia, Tom Cruise is rock solid in the role of Precrime specialist, John Anderton. One of the more appealing aspects of the film is seeing Cruise jump into the skin of a tortured drug addicted cop on the run. certainly a nice break from the safe confines of superstar status. Although Cruise maximizes the role's potential, unfortunately, he's also bound by the film's pacing. In certain scenes when sympathetic emotional intent is clear, the film's fast paced storyline doesn't give Cruise time enough to shine, or the audience occasion to feel his pain. In addition to momentum, the story also suffers from certain logical loopholes with regard to the entire concept of \\\"Precrime,\\\" leaving many unanswered questions when reflecting back on the plot, which could be interpreted as justification for such a fast paced adrenaline ride.  Spoiler Alert  My main problem with Minority Report is the the film, at least the idea of it, should have never happened. We've run into this problem before with movies such as Terminator 2 and Back to the Future. Here's the problem; Anderton would have never went to kill Crowe had he not seen it in the Precrime room. But the Precogs show it to him as if he had planned it. That's another thing; the precogs only give an ample amount of time to catch these `murderers' when there is premeditation. In the opening scene, we are explained that when there is no premeditation, there is little time to stop there murders from happening. Assuming that Anderton didn't see his crime, and also assuming that Anderton was thrust into a position where he was face to face with Crowe, there would have been no premeditation. My problem is, again, Anderton would have never went to find (and kill) Crowe had he not seen it happen. So it would have never happened therefore never been shown to him. As much as I enjoyed Minority Report, the film left me bruised with a few bumps on the head after my theater chair also served as an ejection seat which, at times, launched me out of the movie to the roof, then back again. Believe me, too much exposition hurts. However, with a supporting cast that includes the great Max von Sydow as Precrime Director Burgess, Colin Farrell, Steve Harris from ABC's The Practice, Tim Blake Nelson, Samantha Morton and a slew of highly recognizable cameos, Minority Report isn't soft in the acting department.  At times, Minority Report also upholds a level of class and orchestral dignity as Anderton also serves as a visual conductor to John Williams' haunting, mysterious and heart pounding score via visual precognition. With famed cinematographer Janusz Kaminski working his magic, Minority Report's presentation is second to none in visual appearance. From this reviewer's perspective, Minority Report represents a new benchmark in the science fiction genre in subject matter and visual appeal. I admire the places Spielberg is willing to explore as a director. Sure, he could make \\\"E.T. 2\\\" but instead, he chooses to take on challenging films such as this. Simply put, Minority Report is an impressive visual extravaganza that takes the mind on a cerebral action packed ride into the future.  \", \"The reviews of this film are reminiscent of those of Waking Life - an even more putrid mess of garbage than this one. All of them admiringly describe the emperor Spielberg's clothes. But he's naked. It's not so much that the film is hopelessly confused and illogical; even really good ones, like Groundhog, don't hold up (logically, that is) under close scrutiny, and virtually none of Hitchkock's greats make real sense. The difference is that the good ones work; the bad ones just confuse and strike you as phony while you're watching them. One of the most annoying aspects of this film is the incessant product plugs, particularly those of Gap, which will not even be around in 2054. So if you really don't like this, don't feel that you're somehow deficient in sensibility. Just realize that the reviewers are a herd and that you don't have to admire the threads of a naked jerk.\", \"Steven Spielberg is without doubt one of the greatest film directors the world has ever seen. Sure, his films may always be blatantly mainstream, but that doesn't mean he can't be considered a great director. When you take into consideration the films that he's made, you can't help but respect Spielberg for his achievements and talent. Not only is there clear artistic merit in each one of his movies \\u0096 indicative of his experience and skill \\u0096 but each movie is exceedingly entertaining, catering for all audiences and hence making each one a hit with the general populace.  Spielberg has the infallible ability to combine mainstream with art when it comes to the medium of film, and this is the one quality which distinguishes him from other directors; and as mentioned above, it's also the reason why his movies are so popular and why he is so highly regarded as a director. Twenty years after he first started out as a totally unknown figure, Spielberg entered the new millennium as one of the most influential figures in history, and continues to make top-notch movies with his winning formula \\u0096 Minority Report continues this streak.  Spielberg returns to the genre of science-fiction (after the 1990's saw no films of the like coming from him) with Minority Report. It's perhaps the most intelligent sci-fi movie of the decade in fact, and it adapts the same principle that all of Spielberg's movies operate on. There's the artistic and technical side of the movie \\u0096 the brilliant screenplay, the outstanding visuals, the powerful themes \\u0096 and the entertainment factor \\u0096 dozens of chase sequences, futuristic weapons and the like \\u0096 and as a result we get a highly original movie, and one that also boasts the high IQ of the Pre-Cogs.  Who are the Pre-Cogs? They're psychic beings who have can foresee the future. It's the year 2054, and the United States government has set up a department called PreCrime, which utilises these Pre-Cogs to predict murders before they even happen, hence their name. The names, victims and times of the murders are provided by the Pre-Cogs to the PreCrime agents, and they intervene and prevent these murders before they actually occur. As a result, the homicide rate drops to 0%, and PreCrime becomes the most groundbreaking government action in United States history.  In Minority Report, Tom Cruise shows he is an ideal lead in an action film, and here he plays one of PreCrime's agents, John Anderton. He's as good as ever as he dodges futuristic weapons (including a 'sick-stick' which makes one vomit on cue, incapacitating targets in the weirdest way), jumps on the roofs of moving cars and sets out to clear his name. The story is that the Pre-Cogs have named his as the next person to commit a murder, and in four days he'll murder a man he doesn't even know. Naturally, as it's part of PreCrime's duty to apprehend murderers before they even murder, Anderton is immediately made a fugitive, and he goes on the run. Speaking of fugitives, Minority Report is like the 90's film The Fugitive, except set over 50 years in the future with a newer, classier plot, and off course with a totally different look.  Minority Report has a totally unique visual style. Shots were overlit and colours were desaturated in the post-production process, resulting in predominantly blue shading in some scenes, noticeable brightness in others and even a high-contrast film noir in select scenes. On top of this is perhaps some of the finest art and set decoration I've ever seen. The film imagines Washington D.C. 50 years from now, and that very prediction of our lifestyle is ambitious indeed; cars which drive themselves, home appliances which operate on voice command, holograms and highways which even run vertically \\u0096 the most wild and imaginative concepts are placed together into one single movie, and even though it eventually builds to disappointing level of cynicism and implausibility, it's still wonderful to look at and experience. Suspension of disbelief comes into full swing in Minority Report \\u0096 as do all of Spielberg's movies \\u0096 and is what makes the movie so, so entertaining.  The 140 minutes zoom by in a flash as John fights for survival and at the same time fights to clear his name, and his journey of endurance eventually turns into a test of redemption and revenge as the film's revelations unfold to the audience. Minority Report is heavy-laden with the aforesaid themes, and make the movie a visceral and thought-provoking experience, on top of the high enjoyment level we are subjected to. The only problem with Minority Report is that there are so many themes, ideas and concepts that the film offers that it becomes a chore to sit through; on top of this are the film's revelations, which are both extremely satisfying and extremely confusing at the same time. The screenplay is unexpectedly complex, up to the point where it takes a while to figure out why someone's doing that, or why something happened. Thankfully, it's a fault that's easily overcome, and fails to undermine the film's superiority substantially.  Minority Report is definitely not Steven Spielberg's best film, or even one of his best movies; that said it's far off from being one of his worst films either. It's a fine film to add to his CV and a fine film in itself; Minority Report is the most intelligent science-fiction film of the 2000's, and its ability to be artistically beautiful coincides with its ability to entertain and enthral without any conflict or imperfections. This is what makes Minority Report so successful and so good, and is what makes the movie worth checking out, not the film's synopsis as one would normally do. Do yourself a favour, and see the film for its art and intelligence for a change.  8.5/10\", \"Minority Report is one of the best sci-fi/action film that I have seen in a while, it is in the same vein as Blade Runner.  The story is a very interesting one. In the future, they can predict murders before they happen (who will be the murderer and who the victim) but as the film proves it doesn't matter how perfect the system looks, it still has flaws and can be used unscrupulously by someone with a bad agenda which happens in the case of John Cruise's character John Anderton. He lost his son and he believes in the system and even enforces it but it isn't till it is used against him that he realises it is not a perfect system.  The special effects are amazing and the action really does have you on the edge of your seat. I like that the film is very unpredictable, you really don't know how it will end especially when Anderton is faced with the man he thinks took his son and you wonder if he will really kill the man. Also, you wonder how Anderton will get out of the situation when everything is against him and you are really left wondering right up to the end of the film how it will be resolved and how Max Von Sydow (Lemar) will be brought to justice, I really enjoyed the twist at the end.\", \"Minority Report, I would say, is one of the best science fiction films to be released over the past twenty-five years, and that is certainly no small feat given some of the competing films released over that time-span. Minority Report obviously had a lot of effort put into it by both the filmmakers and its actors and the result is a brilliant thriller. In the past decade I would call it Spielberg's best, ranking among his other great thrillers, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', and 'Jaws'.  The movies is based on a short story by the late sci-fi master Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Total Recall, A Scanner Darkly) and it ranks up with Blade Runner as the greatest adaptations of his work. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the Chief of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia. What exactly is his job? To use the unusual psychic abilities of three beings \\u0096 known as \\\"Pre-Cogs\\\"- it is his job to analyze future crime scenes and prevent murder from happening. For ten years this system works without a flaw and they are close to taking the program national, only there's one problem\\u0085John's name has been called for the future-murder of Leo Crow \\u0096a man he has never once before met. On the run Anderton must evade the highly controlled security of the future United States capital all while trying to prove his innocence, and in so doing unraveling the secrets of the system- secrets that would destroy everything the organization has worked so hard to achieve.  What really makes this movie stand out is not the visual effects (though, they certainly are amazing), but it is the human aspect of this film that makes it a memorable experience for the audience. The film manages to cater to all human emotions contained within the plot, from the fear of loss, obsession, greed, fear, insecurity, and many more. All the characters are found to be believable, as none of them come across as being cardboard, as so many other action films do.  Tom Cruise pulls a very believable performance and I consider this one of the best of his \\\"Average Joe\\\" performances. By this I mean like in 'War of the Worlds' he doesn't come across as being a superhero, as he was in the 'Mission Impossible' franchise. He is perfectly believable as a sad soul who only wishes to make up for his past mistakes and punish the criminals of the world. Haunted by tragedy of the past we can't help but sympathize for his loss, because we can believe him. This isn't a straight-forward \\\"tragic\\\" character, such as Kurt Russell's Colonel O'Neil in 'Stargate' (1994). John Anderton is suffering, but he hides it well, going on with his job. In fact his loss is his drive in his work, so naturally he can't believe it when the system turns against him. It's the compelling characters and performances from the actors that make the difference between a good movie and a great movie. Special effects have nothing to do with the quality of the human element of the story (sorry, Michael Bay).  The special effects of this film are amazing, providing a believable, yet still fascinating view of the future. Unlike visions presented in Blade Runner, and to a certain degree Total Recall, this is a very clean, well kept design for the future. All the buildings shine and all vehicles appear to be in tip-top condition, but like those other Dick based films the underlying structure of society is as corrupt as ever. How the effect crew for this film was skipped over by the Academy I will never understand, because even two years after I first saw the film many of the visuals remain stuck in my mind.  You should not miss Minority Report, because in my opinion it is one of the best films ever made, let alone one of the best science fiction films ever made. For a thrilling, emotional, and mentally stimulating movie experience I can't recommend Minority Report strongly enough to give the film credit, for it goes above and beyond what so many other films have done. So, if you want excitement and brain stimulating ideas forget the garbage of the current theater's films, such as \\\"Transformers,\\\" and do yourself a favor: forget that an action movie is not supposed to be dominated by pure special effects and action, go out, buy a copy of Minority Report, put it in your DVD player, sit down, and enjoy a non-stop thrill ride of a movie.\", \"How many movies have you seen that allows you to think about it for days? The first time you'll See this, I can guarantee that you will want to watch it again, because you won't have figured it all out. It's brilliantly directed and acted, with a magnificent set design. The holes are insignificant, and will get you thinking about it days and days afterwards. There is nothing negative about this masterpiece, and is really the reason why we go to the movies these days.For something inventive and amazing- see minority report, as it is a rare film. It gets you thinking, as most movies today fail to do, and yet becomes a modern day classic with its ideas\", \"This film is an intelligent sci-fi murder mystery with a twist... we know who the victim is, we know who the killer is but neither we nor the killer have the faintest idea why the killing will take place. Set in a future where the future can be seen by three \\\"pre-cogs\\\" murder is a thing of the past as the would be killers are arrested before they can commit their crimes. One day the head of this police department has terrifying shock when the pre-cogs tell him there is going to be a murder and he will be the killer.  From then on the hunter becomes the hunted as Chief John Anderton must run from his own officers to determine why he is destined to kill a stranger before they can incarcerate him. He is never fully sure who he can and can't trust and only has thirty six hours to find out if his destiny is truly written.  The acting is pretty good with Tom Cruise being believable as the fugitive police officer, however the best performance comes from Samantha Morton in the role of Agatha; the pre-cog who Anderton turns to for help and who in turn seeks his help in solving an old case. Steven Spielberg did a fin job directing this. Using just the right amount of special effects he never lets the story be overshadowed by explosions and excessive CGI. When I first watched it I wasn't too sure about the washed out colours used in every scene apart from the few flashbacks it the more of the film I saw the more I thought they suited the tone of the film. If you are a fan of slightly dystopian science fiction I'd certainly recommend this.\", \"Minority Report is a fine example of well told science fiction. The Sci-Fi genre has often been ridiculed because of the great number of hacks that have infested it, but fortunately there are often refreshingly intelligent and well-related stories like this one is.  It deals with some time travel paradoxes, which is always a strong cornerstone that provides an enormous amount of creative license for the writer. This movie taps those resources with ingenuity and vision, and takes the viewer to a futuristic world where a crime is punished before it's committed. This unique premise gives the writer room to explore social issues and implications of this practice. Certainly a metaphor for our current justice system is hidden just below the surface.  As far as plain entertainment value goes, it delivers here also. The action never stops, the plot unfolds with precision, and innovative camera shots are utilized for both stark and surreal imagery.  The only beef here is a weakness in the casting. Most of the cast are up to their roles, well enough to make the hackting of Tom Cruise less of a distraction than it might have been, considering he plays the lead. It seems in most of his movies, the director makes sure to have accomplished actors to counter balance the Cruiser's dramatic shortcomings. He has almost become invisible in his own movies, which can only be a good thing for the movie makers and audience.  In spite of the poor lead actor, this is an outstanding film. Highly recommended.\", \"Recap: John Anderton is the chief officer at Pre Cog DC, a department that with the aid of three clairvoyant humans stop and arrest murderers before they have their crime. As a result of this, murders are virtually extinct in the capital, and the system is now beginning to go nationwide. Before this, the FBI want to investigate the system and sends agent Danny Witwer. Witwer and Anderton come at odds from the beginning and it turns catastrophically worse when the Pre Cogs see a now rare premeditated murder, where the perpetrator is John Anderton. Now he is a fugitive and need to find out why he will murder a man he has never met.  Comments: Another of these high budget, special effects filled blockbusters based on a Philip K Dick novel. And in my mind his novels need a high budget and it need to be packed with special effects. Because Minority Report, like many of Dick's novel, is set in the future and is highly speculative in both science and fantasy. To visualize these ideas that you need a lot of CGI.  But those ideas, those effects are what make Minority Report entertaining. And it is very entertaining. It manages to balance this immense load of special effects with just an immense philosophical question. It all goes down to if there is free will or not. Are we able to really choose for ourselves, or are we just imagining that we can but are ultimately controlled by \\\"fate\\\". For Anderton, and hence for us, this question is really put to the edge. Is he able to avoid committing the crime, and the police, or is he destined for a fate worse than death. To find that out Anderton takes us on a wild, entertaining ride.  Basically, when you sit down to watch this movie you have a choice, well if you believe in that. You can either just lean back and enjoy the ride, or you can be active and ponder the philosophical question the is the foundation of the movie. Or, and this is what make this movie special, you can actually do both.  As a bonus you have a few cameos and a small but hilarious (at least for us Swedes) role for Peter Stormare.  A movie to really enjoy, both when you watch it and afterwards when it almost is inevitable to think about it.  8/10\", \"I watched it when it hit video stores shelves and I regret for not watching it on the theaters.  By far, it was the most complex and interesting sci-fi/action packed flick from 2002.  I did have my doubts towards it because Tom Cruise starred on it. You know, by the time of it's release, he got really weird.  But in my opinion, this is his best performance by far. But he's not alone, he's joined by the always powerful Max Von Sydow who delivers a fantastic performance. I don't get used to watch his as a villain.  The complex plot was really interesting, filled with crime, spectacular f/x, mysterious characters, and extraordinary action sequences.  Every single minute caught my attention and although I can't really remember most of the specific details or sub-plots; I can say without fear of being wrong that this is a spectacular sci-fi/action flick in all the sense of the word.\", \"Movies are only effective if they involve the viewer; we can't enjoy someone's story if we don't care about what happens to them. In general, the best way to do this (at least for a mainstream movie) is to present a strong story. Based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, \\\"Minority Report\\\" is a tense thriller that poses a number of intriguing ethical questions.  Welcome to the era of PreCrime: a world without murder. Three special people, known as the PreCogs, are about to predict murders before they happen. Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) works for the PreCrime division, and is passionate that it works. But when the PreCogs predict that he is going to commit a murder, Anderton has to find out why before he is caught.  If you could see into the future, does that mean that what you saw is really going to happen? Can someone change their mind at the last minute? Is it right to arrest someone for a crime that they were going to commit, but hadn't done it yet? These questions lie at the heart of \\\"Minority Report,\\\" and fortunately they are not mentioned then disregarded; the whole storyline revolves around answering them.  Despite his bizarre off-screen antics, Tom Cruise is a good actor. This is certainly one of his best performances. Anderton is a man who uses this opportunity to battle personal demons, although it only partly works. He is deeply troubled by his past, and that conflict makes Anderton an almost tragic figure. Cruise plays the part perfectly, and we never stop rooting for him. Colin Farrell is effective in his breakout role as Danny Witwer, the agent from the Judicial System who begins snooping around PreCrime, perhaps to take over John's job. Max von Sydow brings a deep note of class to the film as PreCrime's director, and John's mentor, Lamar Burgess. It's an effective performance, and for a man who could easily play an elderly man, von Sydow is certainly an arresting figure. Samantha Morton has the most difficult part as Agatha, one of the PreCogs. She's bizarre, acting as if she's on some sort of a drug. But Morton allows us to peek beneath to see her lucidity. Kathryn Morris, the always wonderful Lois Smith, and Mike Binder are good in bit parts, while Tim Blake Nelson and Peter Stormare steal scenes in terrifically loopy performances.  This is Steven Spielberg's best film since \\\"Saving Private Ryan.\\\" He keeps the pace up, and shows us that he's still a director, and not just a name on a marquee. Spielberg has a vivid imagination and brings everything to life. This is a science fiction film, but it is grounded in reality enough that it is plausible that everything that happens in this film could be real in the near future. The film is well-paced and put together; it's a complex plot, and deals with some serious ethical questions, but it's never confusing. Special note goes to his music selection. Spielberg mixes some classical music into the film very effectively, and the soundtrack by John Williams represents some of his best work.  The only problem I have with the film is that in one scene, it breaks the rules the film functions by for its own convenience. That being said, most people won't notice (or care).  Note: while the action sequences are pretty standard stuff (albeit well-shot and choreographed), the flashbacks of murders are pretty graphic. This really pushes the boundaries of PG-13.\", \"The human race has always been obsessed by the future, which is probably one distinctive trait that makes it human and takes it out of animality. Humanity has to plan its future in order to survive, hence it has to predict its future needs. But humanity remains an animal race in many ways, including of course its survival instinct. So crime is part of the picture, what we call crime in our human ethics. But this is nothing but the individual survival instinct that goes against the collective survival instinct. Then the collectivity, human society decides to consider the individual survival instinct as being a crime and as deserving punishment. It is, and has been, tempting to predict what and which individuals will become criminals in order to prevent that crime. It was for instance suggested under President Nixon to preventively take away into reform schools all the kids, aged six or seven, that had the \\u00ab typical criminal \\u00bb psychology before they realized their destiny which was considered as inescapable and necessarily criminal. This approach was essentially behavioral. Then another appeared, essentially genetic this time and some still believe that the DNA of any individual contains its destiny that is absolutely inescapable. So let us put away those who have the \\u00ab crime \\u00bb genes. Steven Spielberg deals with this dilemma but based this time on a modern embodiment of the seers of old. Three people have been transformed by some genetic manipulation into seers of the future and their predictions are considered as absolutely infallible since they always seem to agree. Then the criminals are arrested before they commit their crime and put away. The effect is the disappearance of crime from Washington D.C. in just a few years. But Steven Spielberg goes further and demonstrates that there are several flaws in this theory. First the three seers don't always agree and there might be a minority report from one of them that is over-ruled by the two others and not communicated to the precrime police. Then this precrime police is a private enterprise and it was necessary to prove its efficiency to get the business. Little by little it appears that the founder of this technology manipulated it in order to prove his theory by arresting someone who was supposed to kill a woman just before he did. That one was paid by the inventor who then afterward committed himself the very crime exactly the way it was supposed to happen which enabled this second crime to be understood by technicians as a simple echo of the first one that was prevented and to be disregarded. The death of the woman only became a missing person. That is the flaw of the film : why didn't anyone investigate this \\u00ab disappearance \\u00bb ? But then he also had to trick his own associate, the main detective of this precrime police. He does that by getting the latter's son killed in such a way that the crime will remain unsolved. But this enables the boss to nourish in his associate a desire to know who killed his son. This associate's coming around to that knowledge will make him become a criminal and thus he will be neutralized and put away but after the crime is committed for reasons that are not clear. But a few facts were brought together and sorted out by this cop's wife and then she manages to get her husband free, which sounds quite iffy, and this triggers a full process of truth discovery and public broadcasting. The end is yours to discover. But this approach, with marvelous special effects and beautiful action, seems to overkill the point it wants to make : The future is inescapable and predictable, and yet the future can be tampered with and manipulated. The first principle is excessive and even wrong. The second is probably true. But both together are just absurd because contradictory. The point is then disproved by this very contradiction. But it is a great film nevertheless that reveals this question of the future and its possible prediction is essential to man and humanity.  Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne\", \"John Anderton (Tom Cruise), chief of the service of precrime in Wanshington, tries to prove his innocence against a system which has indicated him as a future murderer.   In Order to give life to a rather pessimistic universe, from the American writer Philip K.

Pioneering and deeply prophetical representation of a dark future , with Tom Cruise in one of his darkest and most demanding interpretations of his career.  I believe there are similarities with Davis' The fugitive.

Neal McDonough is good as Fletch I just wished they gave him more to do. Kathryn Morris is good as Cruise's wife I really liked her. Rest of the cast do fine.  Overall Go see it immediately!. ***** out of 5\", \"The beginning of Minority Report engages the audience with mise en scene to establish a genre. The audience can easily see that the film is set in the future due to the bright lighting and a blue overlay colour. This implies cleanliness and a utopia. However due to the atmosphere created by the dark shadows and low saturation of the colours an implication is created that this futuristic world may not be a utopia but a dystopia. It gives a sense that without colour in the world there is no emotion and people actions are now based on what a machine says rather that acting on human instinct. In detective films in the present, the police station is often seen as a messy but friendly place with coffee mugs and paper everywhere. But in Minority Report the police station is empty; even the lights seem to dark and have no impact of the white surfaces. This may reflect Spielberg's views towards the future. That in fact the future may appear to be perfect but is actually the opposite.  This idea of Spielberg's ideology is a recurring theme throughout the film. Near the beginning of the film there is an advert to promote the use of the pore-cognatives to encourage the use of pore-crime nationwide. This suggests there will be no more suffering and everything will be right in America. However, there is a false sense of security throughout the film. The scene of the promotional advert leads straight into the complete opposite; of the hero 'John Anderton' running onto a dark alley looking to buy drugs; and buys them from a man who sold his eyeballs for money; which is a common thing to do in future the audience finds out. This is a clear message about the opposing views there may be in the film and not just those of Spielberg. In a way it reflects America in the present also. While many Americans enjoy the good life and are wealthy, just as many live in very poor conditions. These two extremes have been brought out into the open in the film.  The film may well have been designed to attract the male audience as it is usually men who are drawn in by crime and detective films. However due to the level of action and the originality of the idea teenagers and young adults would find this film enjoyable. This interplay of detective work and action is cleverly placed throughout the film. A general story is introduced about the pore-cognatives and the hero is introduced. This is a detective moment where the pore-cogs foresee a murder. An action scene then follows as Tom Cruise (John Anderton) goes to prevent the murder which involves coming out of a helicopter and busting into a house. This is the action sequence. The whole film is played out like this and I believe this is how Spielberg manages to have more that one target audience.  The film subtly hints that in the future the world will be over run by media and advertising. Where the adverts in the street actually refer to you by name and talk to you. Another idea of this entrapment is the eye recognition machines that track you where ever you are. This gives the implication that there is no freedom for the people of the future and that again like in the police station their lives are heavily influenced by machines and technology. This new idea of entrapment and inescapability adds to the imperfection of the future world which is presented to the audience.  It is only as the film progresses and the hero is forced into the underbelly of city life that this idea of entrapment continues to the next level. He needs to run from the police but due to the inescapable future he cannot hide. Therefore he himself is lead to have his eyes removed and have new ones put in, so that he has a way past the claustrophobic machines and devices. But the future has another trick up it's sleeve. The use of robotic spider like creature which are designed to penetrate any home of place of holding. They then climb up you and scan you retina; which is much like a finger print, in that everyone has their own unique pattern, representing their individuality. So once again the idea of the future being like a prison that you cannot escape is brought around.  In the end the designer of pore-crime Lamar Burgess turns out to be the villain. So the very man who was promoting the perfect-ness of the future turned out to be fake. Which is the final say in the idea that the future is misinterpreted and although appears to be all wonderful with problems is in fact the opposite. A place where poor people or people who have committed crimes, sell their eye balls as a means of escape from the world they live in.\", \"Steven Spielberg is one of the few directors around today who can still manipulate an audience in one sense while dazzling and daring that same audience with storytelling and character skills fused with ingenious visual effects. Minority Report is a shining example of that, which also has the grace of having an intelligent concept to start with, which so many sci-fi films lack much less summer sci-fi films (look at MIB2 to see what I mean), and also better than average acting.  Cruise takes the lead role here as John Anderton, who leads, more or less, the agency of police that prevent all murders on the basis of predictions from three Pre-Cogs (one of them Samantha Morton who has the most important role of the three). The system is presumably perfect, until to the surprise of Anderton, he is seen to commit a murder and so starts his quest to try and find out if there is a flaw in thirty six hours. This could be the basis for average sci-fi fodder (Impostor, a film based on another Philip K. Dick story that came out earlier this year, is an point of that), yet Spielberg elevates a story and creates a unique atmosphere to coexist with his characters; by the time the film is HALF way through you'll be exhausted in entertainment.  Bottom line, this is the type of picture to see twice, first to get the feel and presence, and the second to clear up any misunderstandings in the plot (or maybe to avoid Scooby Doo and Windtalkers), since this is indeed one of the best pictures of the year and one of Spielberg's best recent pictures. Grade: A+ or A  \", \"It's an open secret: the Oscar is jinxed. Spielberg's triumph with \\\"Schindler's List\\\" was followed by the longest hiatus of his career, which was broken with ... \\\"Jurassic Park II\\\", a lifeless sequel of the kind you'd once have sworn he'd never make - the single worst and most anonymous movie he's ever directed (\\\"Hook\\\" had its moments). His next two films were improvements (there was nowhere to go but up): the first anonymous but not bad (\\\"Amistad\\\"), the second bad but not anonymous (\\\"Saving Private Ryan\\\"), but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to win still more awards; and it wasn't until eight years after \\\"Schindler's List\\\" that the skilled director of old times re-appeared (with \\\"A.I.\\\" in 2001).  But he's well and truly back now, and I'm happy. I've even learned to welcome it when he makes decisions which infuriate me, so long as he makes them with the right kind of self-assured arrogance. I didn't like the voice-over at the end (we didn't need to be told that stuff; we could have worked it out), or the way he caved in to the modern tendency to be needlessly revolting (at least he don't play his gross-out moments for cheap laughs), or even the style of photography (it's easy to manipulate us into thinking the future is a grim place, if you push-process the film until even the images which in the normal course of events would be luscious and rich, are grimy and desaturated - there are other ways of getting colourless images, as Spielberg well knows, and many of them are better). Yet, in the end, big deal. The story is a knockout, the action is taut, the future rich, dazzling and believable. Spielberg is to be particularly congratulated on how completely he has avoided the unimaginative dystopia of \\\"Blade Runner\\\". The future we see here is a MIX of dream and nightmare, so convincing a mix that we can't always tell them apart.  Here's a measure of how good the movie is: in an interview, Spielberg revealed that he completely misunderstood the issues which drive the stories - and there's simply no way of telling this from the finished product. Unless Spielberg was just opportunistically latching on to the hook forced on him by a dim-witted journalist, he THOUGHT the movie was about how much freedom we are willing to give up in exchange for safety (in order to prevent terrorist attacks, for instance). This is interpretation is strained. Three people (the precogs) do indeed give up their freedom in order that millions of other people may be safer, and yes, there is an issue here. When one of the Crime Prevention officer says, \\\"It's best not to think of them as human\\\", I was surprised to find myself nodding in agreement. The benefits of the system are so great that OF COURSE I'd rather not look too closely into the burden that must be borne by three - just three - individuals. Aside from the three unfortunate precogs, nobody is asked to give up any freedom at all. (Except, of course, the freedom to commit murder. But under the law we are already unfree to commit murder, and a good thing too.)  The interesting issues that DO fall naturally out of the story concern the futility of revenge. After people who would otherwise have committed murder are prevented from doing so, they're sent to prison anyway, presumably on the grounds that that's what they deserve - and no doubt it IS what they deserve. But it's clear enough that locking these people up, however much it may be in the interests of justice, serves no purpose. It's exacting revenge on criminals for the sake of exacting revenge - which is exactly what the U.S. justice system is committed to doing at the moment, which is why the future is a realistic one. (Apart from the precognition, that is.) Anderton's mistake is to believe in the value of revenge, and he's never more admirable than when he realises his mistake. (THAT was a great scene; it's a pity I can't tell you exactly why. Suffice it to say that when we think we know where the story's going, we may indeed know where the story's going - but Spielberg is only allowing us to see so much of what's coming up in order to obscure the rest of it.)  The final sign that Spielberg is again at his peak lies in the performances. They're all good. Tom Cruise's weakness as an actor is that he is only ever as good as his director, and the fact that he's so good here means that \\\"Minority Report\\\" was directed by the real Spielberg, the old Spielberg, the Spielberg with the same ability Charles Dickens had to make even his most grotesque creations, and even his LEAST grotesque, come to life.\", \"Steven Spielberg is a genius. So many great films he has directed. The Man who created \\\"Jaws\\\" \\\"Saving Private Ryan\\\" and \\\"Schindlers List\\\" is back for more. In one of his best pictures yet.   It's 2054. A new method of crime prevention \\\"pre-crime\\\" allows the police to look into the future and see the horrific results of murder and rape as they unfold. After a quick introduction to this process, were straight into the big and bold; main man John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is accused of a future murder- to a man he's never heard of. So he's on the run, from a harsh detective (superbly played by Colin Farrell) as he uncovers some horrible truths and has to go back to the unwelcoming past.   Minority report is very good, but also very disturbing- the fact that this film was a PG-13 or a \\\"12\\\" in England is shocking. Parents, a note: if your child is under 12 at least I would strongly recommend you watch this film first. It's dark, compelling, and disturbing- particularly in a scene where he has to exchange his eyes for protection...   This is a fantastic film however that should be viewed and loved by everyone bold enough to come in its path. Never fail to believe: Spielberg has come up with yet another masterpiece.   Overall: ****/ out of ***** (4 and a half out of 5)\", \"This gets high marks for being an involving film that, despite a long length of almost two- and-a-half hours, keeps ones interest all the way. Being a Stephen Spielberg-directed film, it's no surprise that the photography is first-rate. This is nice-looking movie. Tom Cruise also was very good in here, not the obnoxious character he sometimes portrays (or did more often in his younger days.).  The film is a good mixture of action and suspense. Only the one chase scene was overdone with Rambo-like mentality of the good guys not getting hit when they should, and vice- versa.  The subject matter is interesting, too: what would do you (or the police) had very reliable information on crimes that were about to be committed, that you could prevent things from happening before they actually did?  I recognized two people in here who went on shortly thereafter to become recognizable in TV series: Kathryn Morris (\\\"Cold Case\\\") and Neal McDonough (\\\"Boomtown\\\"). Add Colin Farrell, Max Von Sydow, Samantha Morton and you have an interesting cast. I am of the opinion that this is one of Spielberg's underrated gems.\", \"The future, we are told, are what we make of it. Philip K. Dick did not want to take that chance, so he wrote many many many short stories about the future of man and where we, as a society, were headed. Blade Runner, Total Recall, Paycheck, Screamers, and Minority Report are all short stories written by Dick about the future that have been turned into a movie, and most have a less than enthusiastic view of where we are headed. In Minority Report, we see the effects of predicting the future to the point of crimes are prevented by arresting murderers before they kill. If that does not appear logical, there is a quick little scene early in the movie that addresses those concerns, and on the surface makes sense. Tom Cruise plays the Washington, DC pre-crime chief, John Anderton, who runs the investigators who rely on 3 scientifically engineered beings who can see murders before they happen. The system, of course, raises civil liberty issues, but seems to work perfectly, that is until Anderton is fingered for a murder. The rest of the movie, Anderton tries to not only prove that he is innocent, but also that he was set up, possibly by an oily Department of Justice figure who is investigating Precrime before it goes national after an election, played by Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven Spielberg, Minority Report plays as both a \\\"Whodunnit?\\\" and a futuristic exercise of science fiction. Much time was spent on designing the Washington, DC of the 2050s, including cars that run on magnets, virtual reality stations, and much more throughout the film. The most interesting design is of the \\\"sick sticks\\\" used by cops to bring down criminals. The blueish tint given to the film also gives us a cold feeling, a future that is not as loving or as hospitable as the time we live in, another trait of a Dick story. A wonderful movie the works for both the crime buff and the science fiction fan.\", \"May be this film has some flaws but while watching it I wasn't too distracted by that. Here we have one of the greatest directors alive (Steven Spielberg), a very big star (Tom Cruise) with a great ensemble (Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Peter Stormare, Samantha Morton, Tim Blake Nelson) around him, a good cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and a nice score by John Williams all packed in a great story (based on the novel by Philip K. Dick) with perfect visual effects.  In the year 2054 murders can be predicted and stopped before they happen. If you were about to kill but stopped you are locked. Tom Cruise is one of the agents who stops those murders. Then he discovers the next murder they have to stop will be committed by himself.  I will not reveal more of the plot. The story itself is great. It is intelligent, but also exciting with great action scenes. The visuals are truly beautiful and perfectly support the sci-fi story. If you like action thrillers and you don't mind they are set in the future (with some futuristic gadgets) this is your film. 9/10.\", \"Steven Spielberg is at his directorial best with this action, adventure. Tom Cruise is at his acting best as a futuristic cop on the run. I was pleased to see one of the best directors team up with one of the best actors to make a brilliant movie.  Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, the chief of the Pre-Crime unit of the Washington D.C. police department. This unit stops murders before they happen, with the help of the \\\"Pre-Cogs.\\\" The \\\"Pre-Cogs\\\" are three psychics who see the murders before they happen, and Cruise is the one who puts their visions together to predict the location, the killer, and the victim of the future crime. So far, the \\\"Pre-Cog\\\" division has been successful, with its six-year span going on with no murder ever happening. Things get complicated for the future of Pre-Crime when Detective Danny Witwer, played by Colin Farrell, is sent to inspect the operation. Anderton is suspicious of him, because he starts to see cracks in the system. When Anderton believes that the cracks are minor, he believes wrong.  Anderton sees another murder happening in the Pre-Cogs' visions and is shocked to see that he is the man committing the murder. Now that he is on the run from his own men, which of course is under the command of Witwer, Anderton must unravel the mystery of why he has to murder a man whom he hasn't even met yet. As time runs out, Anderton finds clues that there is a conspiracy behind it. Can he figure them out in time, or will Pre-Crime see its first murder in six years?  \\\"Minority Report\\\" is a movie with a fantastic storyline, one of the best I've ever heard of. The actors are great, the directing is great, of course, it's Spielberg. Even the effects are great, they are done with ILM. Roger Ebert says that this movie \\\"reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place,\\\" and I agree with him.\", \"This is spoken in Minority Report by a drug-dealer on the streets with no eyes at all, so I suppose its free advice for John Anderton, our hero, or a bit of wise-sounding advice meant to get across to the audience but with no other good place for it to fit in the film. This is fine with me, too, because Minority Report is such a taut futuristic thriller that an incongruous little bit of wisdom like this is not to have any negative impact on the film as a whole. John Anderton, played with precision by the great Tom Cruise (oh shut up, the man's awesome), is the chief of the Pre-Crime department in the District of Columbia, which has successfully eradicated murder entirely for the last six years. He works with a group of `pre-cogs' that, together, dream of murders that have not yet taken place and project enough information for Anderton and his team to watch the video emanating from their heads to determine where and when the murders are to take place and to get to those locations and stop the murders from happening before they happen.   This is obviously a formula for a highly successful action movie, but the thing that really makes Minority Report succeed is that it pays so much amount of attention to things that would occur in this situation in real life. It is explained very early in the film that the invention of Pre-Crime has eradicated premeditated murder, as this is most easily detected by the pre-cogs. The majority of the `business,' then, of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia, are crimes of passion. This not only provides the possibility of a lot more tension in that these crimes leave a lot less time for prevention, but also avoids complicating the plot with the details of premeditated murders. We don't care about a guy who wronged another guy five years ago or drug deals gone bad, all we need to hear about are a guy who comes home to find his wife in bed with another man and loses control.  Given the fact that the movie involves some sort of time-travel (even if information is the only thing traveling through time), it leaves itself open to criticism about plot holes. This is obvious, because plot holes like this even permeated the unparalleled Back to the Future series, which obviously had plenty of plot holes but handled them spectacularly well. Given the amount of movies that I have seen that involve time travel, I have come up with this equation: Time Travel = Plot Holes. This is a universal equation that is never escaped, but it does not mean that any movie that involves time travel will be brought down by the subsequent and unavoidable plot holes. Minority Report did not suffer from its necessary plot holes and neither did the timeless Back to the Future series (which has FINALLY been released as a complete set and which no respectable movie collection could possibly be without).   My esteemed colleague and close friend Christopher Brown (see his brilliant reviews at http://us.imdb.com/CommentsAuthor?625436) points out one of these plot holes in his review of Minority Report, but makes the mistake of suggesting that, given the nature of the precognition and of the crime itself, Anderton's murder should never have been predicted since it did not entail premeditation. Sorry, Chris, but you've missed the boat on this one. The only thing that this does is bring up the fact that it's impossible to tell where precognition starts. It could be argued perfectly well that the pre-cogs played a part in their own precognition. They predicted that Anderton would commit the murder under the circumstances that he would have been watching the thoughts of the pre-cogs and seen that he would commit murder, and then obviously sought to find out for himself how he could have been expected to commit a murder against a person he has never heard of. In this case, if he had called in sick that day, all of this would have been avoided. But he's the best at what he does, he has personal reasons for wanting to stop murder, he does not slack off, he does not call in sick. John Anderton was predicted by the pre-cogs to commit murder because he was at work that day.   The action in the film comes from the possibility that the whole prediction of Anderton's murder might be what is called a `minority report,' where the pre-cogs disagree on something that is going to happen. If he can prove that only one of the pre-cogs came up with the vision that he was going to commit a murder, it might cancel out the entire prediction because it is unreliable. On the way to this goal, we are presented with everything from a tremendously dedicated investigator (played brilliantly by Colin Farrell) to some amazingly creepy but strangely accepted identification spiders that scan John's implanted eye in one of the more uncomfortable scenes in the film.   Minority Report is one of the best and most unique thrillers to be released in years. It is the conglomeration of such a dizzying array of films that it is difficult to contemplate them all at once. We see elements of action films, futuristic thrillers, crime films, science fiction, and of course, the influence of Stanley Kubrick is never far off. There is even, especially in the later portion of the film, a heavy influence on the soundtrack by Bernard Herrman, who was the composer for most of Alfred Hitchcock's films, among many others. It's always nice to see such a respectful homage like that, and it is only one of the many things that makes Minority Report yet another addition to Steven Spielberg's extensive list of high-end films (the last of which was the spectacular A.I.). The only thing I can think of that holds Minority Report back from joining Spielberg's list of timeless classics is that it does not have the scope as far as its target audience as such films as E.T. and Jurassic Park. However, despite not having quite as large of a target audience, Minority Report stands as a strong entry in Spielberg's growing list of great films.\", \"I read a lot of previous posts about this movie. This is one of the best films of the year, and of recent years. This is a perfect blend of action, suspense, thrills and film-noir. The plot is intelligent and fresh. People saying it is not original must have slept through the movie. Tom Cruise is fantastic, Colin Farrell is amazing, as well as Samantha Morton. Spielberg again proves that he is the master of cinema. A truly great director. I'll agree, the ending was a little too happy, but not worth complaining about. This film is not about product placement as previously suggested, it is simply a entertaining and yet realistic glimpse of what our future may look like, as advertising becomes more advanced and intrusive. The film creates many moral questions and issues, and should leave you thinking. Is being arrested for doing something you actually havn't commited yet fair? It is worth seeing again and again.

The Mexico City locations are as chaotic as the storyline moves towards its predictable, violent conclusion, with plot twists along the way. Washington, a former CIA operative with a drinking problem, gets a good reference from a former fellow agent which sets in motion the plot's outline. Washington and Fanning have a great chemistry between them and after a troublesome beginning, the bodyguard and his charge become the best of friends.

Let's make it straight, the movie deserved its hype as one of the most stylish actioner/thriller ever made.  When it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts really make a perfect duo. Both this movie and Deja Vu are better thrillers you can expect. Washington really got very comfortable in the shaky cameras and every executing scenes in the movie. One would easily be related to his character's emotions therefore enjoyed all the killings on the road. It's a success that they created a super-dark Mexico city with a lot of shits happening. One would be easily convinced by the extent of corruption depicted in Man On Fire. I don't know what would the Mexicans think when they watch this......  Well, let's face it again. It's among the best of the Death Wish genre, but it also suffered from extensive amount of violence. It's a bit annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the movie very realistic and let Denzel Washington play the \\\"missing sheep\\\" type of tragic hero. In the end, they even had the kidnapper shot in his own swimming pool like a documentary. I was checking on IMDb if the movie was based on real events for that...... So that's for your consideration if you also finds the movie's theme is a little bit phony.  At the end, I hope one would not take this movie for real.  8/10 for art direction/editing/cinematographic/Denzel Washington.\", \"This film contains the one ingredient that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion. Sorrow, love, laughter , anger. There are so many emotions thrown into this film. From start to finish this film is immensely captivating. The plot on paper sounds like the usually rubbish that is mostly thrown In the faces of the audiences but don't be mistaken, this film is powerful. Washington as always puts on a great performance.  The plot in a nutshell: man suffers from depression, a young girl brings life into him, kids gets kidnap, man wants revenge. Doesn't sound like anything special but it far superior than any other similar film out there. For instant, TAKEN is a similar film but when you compare them both, MAN ON FIRE wins hands down. The characters are engaging and everyone puts in a great performance and the directing is great. Mexico City feels alive , it looks like Mexico city, it smells like Mexico city. Everything is portrayed brilliantly . the style of direction was something I enjoyed and brought the best out of Mexico City  This is one of those films you'll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you'll beg your family and friends to watch. From start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist, making it a roller-coaster journey. There enough action to keep you happy, there enough character development to please you and then there's Washington to bring a smile to your face . Watch this film, you won't be disappointed\", \"Tony Scott can make good films and bad, personally I think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother, but this is quite possibly his best film.  What makes this film so great is that Scott gives Denzel (on scorching form, better than Training Day) and the revelation who is Dakota Fanning time to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness. The set up is absolutely NOT boring, although it takes time - it is involving, and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a superb role for Radha Mitchell as the mother. This all serves to make the action so much more effective, as we are so invested in the characters, for all their all too obvious weaknesses. This film has you on the edge for its entirety, and doesn't cop out at the end either.  The film would of course be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles, when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there (I can only really think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more on-screen power these days). This film should have been huge, given his status and the strength of his performance, and the quality of the film. It just goes to show you that if a studio doesn't back a film to the hilt, it ends up going straight to video. I wish I'd got the chance to see this on the big screen.\", \"Man On Fire tells a story of an ex-special forces guy with a drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in Mexico during the wave of kidnappings for ransom. At first he's not to friendly, but then they befriend with each other, he decides to stop drinking etc., etc... then one day she gets kidnapped... and killed...  And HE, won't stop at anything to get the revenge.  That's basically the story of Man On Fire but expect some big twists at least a few times including the ending which is beautiful and will probably make you cry.  That's also because of the great music Harry-Gregson Williams with Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator) composed.  But the strongest part of the movie... wait... the thing is, everything here is perfect.  First - acting. Denzel Washington is at his best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken good as always, great Radtha Mitchell and AMAZING young Dakota Fanning. And that's not the end of the list...  Then come the cinematography which is dazzling and along with superb editing, should have won an Oscar for sure.  The story is... not just a revenge movie. The story is intelligent, the story makes you think... and is pure beautiful. Really.  This is one of those movies you need to see in your lifetime, at least once!\", \"In Mexico City, the former CIA assassin and presently an alcoholic decadent man John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is hired by the industrialist Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), with the recommendation of his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken), to be the bodyguard of his young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changes the behavior of the cold Creasy, making him live and smile again, and he feels a great affection for her. When the girl is kidnapped and Creasy is informed that she was murdered by the criminals, he swears to kill each one responsible for the abduction.  \\\"Man on Fire\\\" is almost a masterpiece, and will become certainly a classic in the future. The story is excellent, never corny and although having 146 minutes running time, the viewer does not feel time passing. The cast is composed by excellent actors and actresses, their performances are outstanding, highlighting Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. The cinematography has wonderful moments, and the screenplay has stunning lines. I personally loved when the character of Christopher Walken explains to Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) that Creasey's specialty is death, and he is preparing his masterpiece. I agree with the user that commented that \\\"Man on Fire\\\" is one of the best, if not the best, film of the year in this genre. My vote is ten.  Title (Brazil): \\\"Chamas da Vingan\\u00e7a\\\" (\\\"Flames of the Revenge\\\")\", \"I am amazed that movies like this can still be made. I watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and i can say that this is one of the best i ever seen. Never thinked that a movie of 146 minutes can make me think about it on and on.  Washington, charismatic and intense as ever, plays Creasy, a washed-up ex-counter-terrorist agent who's taken to the bottle. Once he's assigned to protect young Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, his emotional and redemptive arc is jump-started in the way only an adorable little girl can provide. Inevitably, Pita is kidnapped by thugs, and Creasy decides that most of Mexico City must pay the price for daring to take away his character's teddy-bear-clutching catalyst. Yes, he has become...a Man on Fire.   You must see this movie.\", \"It's hard to top this movie in several ways. Everything works really well here; the casting, acting, script, and cinematography are all first-rate. For the moviegoer, it's a moving, violent story of love and human redemption. For the film critic, there's plenty of sharp technique and technical merit. There are some tactical blunders, and as has been discussed on the boards, the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the CIA agent training angle. However, I took the ending as being more moving due to the fact that rather than pursue the CIA agent's pragmatic approach, Creasy basically commends his soul to the Ultimate without considering the consequences. Like Jesus Himself, Creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice, whether it actually makes pragmatic sense or not. In any case, I appreciated the fact that Creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and just caps the bad guys one by one in his methodical quest for justice, which actually results in redemption both for himself and the innocent.   In any case, this film is very much worth watching if you're at all attracted to the genre. An excellent soundtrack, great writing, flawless casting, and solid performances across the board make this a top-100 (or better) film.\", \"Man on fire, is definitely one of the best drama/crime thrillers I have ever seen. Despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well. This is Denzel Washington's perfect role, in which he plays a body guard, called Creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9e, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, the very smart, enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things, and acts in a very convincing manner, she has a great future ahead of her. As I said the story is somewhat complicated, in order to fully understand it, you must watch it a couple of times.  This film is made in two parts, there's the first hour, where everyone is happy, nothing's wrong, everyone's just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of Pita occurs and where Creasy is almost killed. And then there's the second part, the rest of the film, where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing, when Creasy's recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and \\\"La Hermamdad\\\" that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of Pita.  Denzel Washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them. It is a real shame that this film hasn't been acknowledged enough, Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance, and so did Fanning and the director. And even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality.  If you like excellent, slightly deranged, suspenseful thrillers, this is the one to see. The most amazing thing is that elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10/10\", \"This comment does contain spoilers!!  There are few actors that have an intangible to them. That innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma, panache and swagger. It's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great. I think George Clooney has it and so does Jack Nicholson. You can look at Clooney's subtle touches in scenes like his one word good-bye to Andy Garcia in Ocean's 11 when they just utter each other's name disdainfully. \\\"Terry.\\\" \\\"Danny.\\\" You can pick any number of Jack's performances dating as far back as Five Easy Pieces in the diner to A Few Good Men and his court room interrogation scene. These guys just have it. You can add Denzel Washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does. If you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in The Siege to his impressive tribute to Malcolm X in Spike Lee's film of the same name, you can see that there is no finer an actor working today. I don't mention all of this to insinuate that Man On Fire is perfect just because of Denzel's work, but he is definitely the cog of the production. I was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw, emotional and incendiary all at the same time.  Washington plays Creasy a former spy or CIA agent or one of those covert government operatives. He has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led. He has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man. His friend and perhaps mentor, played very reservedly by Christopher Walken, is living in Mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich. Apparently the kidnapping business in Mexico is so vibrant that these paid former S.E.A.L.s and such can do very well while providing a needed service. Creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty. Marc Anthony is fine as Samuel, Radha Mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife Lisa and Dakota Fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as Pita. I don't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of Pita is nothing short of Oscar worthy. The film's entire first half is dependent on the relationship between Pita and Creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role, perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly. But Fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role.  It is the relationship between Pita and Creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema. Together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them. Tony Scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better. I am interested to see how his next film, Domino, turns out. I think Scott is one of today's under rated directors and with more films like this one, his name will surely be elevated to icon status.  The story has Creasy really taking to Pita, and vis-ca versa. There is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although Pita loves her dad, he is not around much. He is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family. Soon, Creasy is taking Pita to her swimming competition. He is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear \\\"Creasy\\\". It's not just a friendship between them, it is more of a kinship, and a deep parental love seems to be present.   The film changes gears when Pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and Creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her. This is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion. And this is where Denzel becomes a tour de force. Like I said earlier, I have seen Denzel give some outstanding performances in films like Crimson Tide and Training Day, but never have I seen him like this. He is a man possessed and with the possibility of Pita being dead, he becomes a literal man on fire. It rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance. Denzel's anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for Pita's violation. This all vigilante justice as the Mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind.   Also what is paramount to this film's audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance. I have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily. They inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die. But not in this film. Writer Brian Helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful. The perpetrators here feel Creasy's wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes. There is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice. He needs information and someone loses a finger. He wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things. There is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film.  Man on Fire is one the five best films of 2004. Now that it is out on DVD, my recommendation is to get the SE. It is loaded with bonus features that include about 6 hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks. 10/10\", \"This is an excellent, heartbreaking movie. It is by far the best I've seen that depicts the current reality in Latin America...kidnappings, corruption, ruthless and greedy police officials and heartless mayhem towards innocent victims. Denzel Washinton gives the most moving performance in his career, in my opinion. Dakota Fanning is an amazing young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed, I believed every minute. The cast is brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke are great as always. Walken lights up the screen for me like no other actor. I would have loved to see more of both of them. The authentic locations are remarkable. The camera work is interesting and different. There are many famous Latin actors in the cast, making it all the more interesting for people familiar with Latin American cinema. I highly recommend this movie.\", \"Man on Fire was hot. I love a classic tale of good ol' revenge, and what better cause for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl.  The writers did an excellent job in this movie of building the relationship between Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) so that the viewer would understand and actually feel the drive Creasy had to rescue Pita. It was also good that Creasy wasn't a choir boy type trying to rescue Pita through the \\\"proper\\\" channels, but instead used torture tactics and street smarts. Some may say, \\\"Torture is wrong regardless,\\\" and you may be right, but when you see the pain Creasy goes through due to the loss of Pita and the sheer passion he has for getting her back, you can't help but side with Creasy and pull for him to be even more merciless. There would be no progress if Creasy used diplomacy to deal with the different nefarious gangsters and criminals and he knew that.  Creasy's quest ended with the return of Pita to her mother and Creasy dying in the vehicle of the bad guys. But Creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the movie, it in fact enhanced it by showing that Creasy was willing to die to get Pita back. His death was noble in fact.  Denzel does an excellent job as do the writers. This movie deserves good marks because it definitely was a good movie.\", \"I get teased all the time by family and friends for my tears over movies, and they were not disappointed when I watched this one. I cried numerous times but believe me it was not over sappiness. I ached for the family and I ached for this man as he tried to redeem himself the only way he knew how. Denzel was fabulous as always, and so was Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, I did not even recognized though; the years have not been kind to him. My husband is not one to re-watch movies unless they are historically accurate war movies(snore!!!!) He has watched this movie 5 times now and I am going to have to get the DVD to watch it again because he has worn out the tape and it jumped the whole time I was watching.\", \"When I remember seeing the previews for this movie and not really thinking much about it. It was almost one of those movies that when you see the preview, its stunning, and then when it comes out, you hear nothing and totally miss it, and your memory totally doesn't correct the mistake of missing it. Man On Fire was one of those movies. I was curious on a rental one time, and I decided to take it home with me, my precious Blockbuster rental in my hands. I watched it, and witnessed such a beautiful movie. It is like none other...drama and action combined to create something amazingly spectacular. The cinematography done by Tony Scott is extremely well done and unique, unlike another movie. The subtitles can explain something without even listening to the actual voices, and the music is very intriguing for the setting. I got into this movie, and ended up buying it as soon as I could scurry out of the household and head over to Best Buy. I've watched it several times now. Denzel Washington (Creasy) does an amazing job with becoming this lost-minded ex-special forces man with no reason to live. Dakota Fanning (Pita) puts life back into him with her undying love for him right from the start. They bond and become good friends, until she is kidnapped by notorious gangsters part of the brotherhood, La Hermandad. Creasy (Denzel) tells the mother of Dakota Fanning that he will hunt down the killers, fearing that Pita is dead. This is where Creasy really shows the person he can become. He uses his contacts from Pita's kidnapping and Creasy's hospitalization to find one of the men and he begins his pursuit. My favorite line of all, is in this movie, when Christopher Walken tells the AFI agent that \\\"A man is a work of art, in anything that he does....cooking, whatever. Creasy's art is death...he's about to paint his masterpiece.\\\" He plays a very unique roll of Creasy's old partner and friend. After finally pursuing the brother of \\\"The Voice,\\\" leader of La Hermandad. Creasy arranges a meeting to trade Pita for himself and The Voice's brother. In the end, Creasy dies from being shot earlier, and his wound getting infected and massive blood loss. It is a very sincere and sad ending, but a great one. I love this movie and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a memorable flick. The story is in depth, everything is explained from beginning to end, and nothing corny at all in any way or manner.\", \"-Kidnappings in Mexico are as common as honeys giving me their phone numbers so if you're rich then you'll need a good bodyguard to keep you and your kids safe. A couple hires a washed up bodyguard called Creasy to protect their adorable kid Pita. At first, their relationship is a tad buggy but after a while, Creasy eases up to the girl and the two develop a father/daughter relationship. One day Pita is kidnapped and Creasy is badly injured in the process. When he wakes up he finds out that the girl has been killed due to a ransom negotiations that went wrong and this sets Creasy on a path find the men responsible for her death and make sure they are brought to his brand of justice.  -Keep some Tylenol next to you while watching this movie because you will need to take some after watching it. I really love the story here of going to the extreme to obtain revenge because most movies usually just want revenge but really never go too far where as this movie they show how far a man can go to do what he feels is right. The only problem is the annoying visual style, which will either make you hate the movie or hate Tony Scott. I really feel sorry for the cinematographer because I'm sure he came into this movie thinking he was going to be filming an action movie and probably got all excited but instead he got stuck being the DP for a filmmaker that feels that the whole movie should look like it's been possessed by demons. I wouldn't have mind if the crappy visuals were restricted to a few action scenes but when it's spread through out the whole movie then that's when we have some problems. The same annoying style was recently used on \\\"Domino\\\" and much like with this movie the style did hurt that otherwise great movie.  -Another person I feel sorry on this movie was the soon to be great Harry Gregson Williams who had the impossible task of trying to compose music out of the jagged images. Somehow, Williams wrote some decent music for the movie but I'm sure if the movie had been more stable then the music would have turned out a lot better. The sound is wrongfully used throughout the movie and instead of enhancing the movie experience, it rather makes you feel like you're being punished. The overuse of the subwoofer is irritating as every 5 seconds or so you can hear an ungodly low end sound coming out of it. I don't know why Scott thought the audience needed to be bombarded by the subwoofer but it really takes you away from the movie.  -The acting in the movie is a beast despite the visuals. Little Fanning does yet another great job here and the scene at the end of the movie just breaks my heart. If the end of the movie doesn't make anyone cry then they're dead on the inside. Denzel Washington breaks his rule of not making any action movies with this movie and luckily, for him he gets to play a great character. The whole idea of a man that's lost in life and all of a sudden due to a tragedy finds a purpose in his life is nothing new but Washington brings some heart and emotion to the otherwise flat character. I love how we witness him from being a loner to actually learning to have emotion and after the kidnapping becoming a cold instrument of revenge. Radha Mitchell plays Marc Anthony's wife and she along with Fanning are the two reasons why I can't hate the movie too much. J.Lo's husband comes and goes in the movie but he doesn't really stand out much. Mickey Rourke and Chris Walken all have minimal roles in the movie but they do make an impact.  -One thing that makes me laugh is how the filmmakers try to makeup for the crappy way they portray Mexico by calling it a fine city at the end of the movie. A little too late for that if you ask me. Let's hope that Tony Scott is done with this phase of intentionally trying to ruin his career because a filmmaker as talented as him CAN and must do better than this.\", \"You know you're in for something different when a movie has Christopher Walken playing the part of a professional hit man - and he isn't even one of the bad guys! Although it could do with some judicious trimming here and there, \\\"Man on Fire\\\" is a generally effective crime drama that ranges in tone from the openly sentimental to the downright brutal - and just about every tone imaginable in between.  Denzel Washington stars as Creasy, a former CIA assassin who has recently quit the business and is seeking some sort of redemption for the sins he's committed. So far, he's been looking for answers in a bottle and the Bible and not doing all that well with either. As the movie opens, Mexico City has been ravaged by a series of kidnappings aimed at the powerful and well-to-do, possibly perpetrated by the very police force assigned to keep law and order in the community. Creasy accepts the position as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy business owner who rightly fears for her safety. The first third of the film is devoted to the growing friendship between Creasy and his charge, Pita, a sweet little girl who, slowly but surely, works her way into Creasy's initially hardened heart and affections. The last two-thirds of the film turns into an Avenging Angel melodrama, as Creasy systematically seeks out and eliminates all those responsible for a tragedy that occurs early on in the story.  Based on the novel by A.J Quinnell, \\\"Man on Fire,\\\" astutely written by Brian Helgeland and flashily directed by Tony Scott, is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter. It takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is, for all intents and purposes, achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering (admittedly disreputable) people. These scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful, even if they do at times border on the exploitative. Even better are the quiet, intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the early parts of the movie. Washington and the wonderful Dakota Fanning establish an natural, easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow.  Washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic righteousness, making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing eludes us intellectually. In addition to the two leads, there are solid performances from Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin and Giancarlo Giannini. But it is Washington and the delightful Ms. Fanning who steal the show.  \\\"Man on Fire\\\" would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time, but this is still a better-than-average crime thriller.\", \"Although released among a flock of revenge-minded action flicks (KILL BILL VOL. 2; THE PUNISHER; WALKING TALL), MAN ON FIRE works as well as it does thanks in large part to the always-watchable Denzel Washington, one of the best actors around today.  In MAN ON FIRE, based on A.J. Quinnell's 1980 novel (first filmed in 1987, with Scott Glenn), Washington plays a down-on-his-luck ex-mercenary who has now stooped to drinking from a flash of Jack Daniels, until his old partner (Christopher Walken) offers him a chance at redemption. He is hired on as a bodyguard to the 10 year-old daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a Mexican businessman (Marc Antony) and his American-born wife (Radha Mitchell). While he and Fanning work like oil and water first (not mixing very well), he really gets to form a bond with her, encouraging her to do better at swimming, while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past. It is that very bond that will force Washington back into his old line of work when Fanning is kidnapped and held for a $10 million ransom, and he is nearly killed. With almost any other stock action hero (Schwarzenneger; Segal, etc.), the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we've seen a million times before. But Washington's character, though he's killing for a reason, does not particularly enjoy doing what he does. Still, he gets help from a very intrepid Mexican newspaper reporter (Rachel Ticotin) out to expose \\\"La Hermanidad\\\" (The Brotherhood), the kidnap gang responsible for Fanning's abduction.  MAN ON FIRE is flawed to some extent because of the hyper camera work, nearly headache-inducing montage editing, and various film stocks that are par for the course of its director Tony Scott (TOP GUN; CRIMSON TIDE), but which are not necessarily unique to him (witness Oliver Stone's use of montage in JFK or Sam Peckinpah's in his classic 60s and 70s films). Still, Scott gets a very good performance from Washington, as well as Fanning, who comes across as far more than a typical movie-brat kid. Harry Gregson-Williams' south-of-the-border Spanish guitar score is enhanced by soundtrack splashes of Chopin, Debussy, and even Linda Ronstadt's classic 1977 country-rock version of \\\"Blue Bayou.\\\" Although the film overall is quite violent, it is no worse than most action films of the last ten years, and overall it is much better than most.\", \"There are many reasons to watch this movie: to see the reality that whips Latin America with regard to the kidnappings thing, the police corruption at continental level, among so many realities that we live the Latins.   The performance of Denzel Wahington was brilliant, this guy continues being an excellent actor and that it continues this way. Dakota Fanning just by 10 years, an excellent actress has become and I congratulate her. The rest of the movie was of marvel, I have it in my collection.   I hope that they are happened to those producing of Hollywood to make a movie completely in Venezuela, where they show our reality better with regard to the delinquency, the traffic of drugs or the political problems. They have been few the movies that they play Venezuelan land (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly) they should make more, as well as they make in Mexico.  The song \\\"Una Mirada\\\" I hope that it leaves in the soundtrack, it is excellent. My vote is 10/10\", \"i liked this film a lot. it's dark, it's not a bullet-dodging, car-chasing numb your brain action movie. a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague, leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions. it's nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own minds.  in the end, motivated by love or vengeance, or a desire to repent - he does what he feels is \\\"right\\\". 'will god ever forgive us for what we've done?' - it's not a question mortal men can answer - so he does what he feels he has to do, what he's good at, what he's been trained to do.  denzel washington is a great actor - i honestly can't think of one bad movie he's done - and he's got a great supporting cast. i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone.\", \"Here's a gritty, get-the-bad guys revenge story starring a relentless and rough Denzel Washington. He's three personalities here: a down-and-out-low-key-now drunk- former mercenary, then a loving father-type person to a little girl and then a brutal maniac on the loose seeking answers and revenge.  The story is about Washington hired to be a bodyguard for a little American girl living in Mexico, where kidnappings of children occur regularly (at least according to the movie.) He becomes attached to the kid, played winningly by THE child actress of our day, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington goes after the men responsible and spares no one. Beware: this film is not for the squeamish.  This is stylish film-making, which is good and bad. I liked it, but a number of people found it too frenetic for their tastes as the camera-work is one that could give you a headache. I thought it fit the tense storyline and was fascinating to view, but it's (the shaky camera) not for all tastes.  Besides the two stars, there is the always-interesting Christopher Walken, in an uncharacteristically low-key role, and a number of other fine actors.  The film panders to the base emotions in all of us, but it works.\", \"Mean-spirited, ugly, nasty retro-action thriller, about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!), the killers of the girl he was supposed to protect. This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. Director Scott doesn't have any desire to apologize for the inherently immorality behind the film's dramatic structure. Scott is either not aware or doesn't care for 30 years of social advances. I really don't think we will see a more violent film any time soon, so you better go and see this one while you can. Despite its relentless grimness, I think the movie is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister, exploitative, and effective. Scott has a tough thing to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of this film are just too effective for me to ignore. Scott's directorial choices are simply astonishing, and he pulls a great performance out of Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls need to stay away from this one, but I recommended it to those viewers looking for a great, action-filled movie.\", \"This is by far one of the better made movies and didn't leave me disappointed at all. The sound track along with finely shot hand-held camera work was exquisite . The are always chances a movie won't hold ones beliefs as well as another, but I felt that rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent. Dakota Fanning is rapidly becoming a staple in movie that require a child with an old soul personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent. As for Mr. Washington and of course Christopher Walken they both exceed the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to move to the light.\", \"I loved this movie. I'm a Mexican and was in the least offended by it. In fact, I think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over Mexico. It's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse. It angers me to read in the news how killers, kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy, Denzel Washington's character. A bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante. Kidnapping is flourishing industry down here (at least in the big cities). I actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one's Creasy did his fine job upon. That would be so marvelous (Sorry, I am THAT resentful!). MAN ON FIRE is a gripping film that you can't miss. It might be hard on some of you, if you aren't used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do that ALL the time while watching American movies) but the effort will be well worth it. Some of the editing is a bit fuzzy...kind of like TRAFFIC, remember? (another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico is). The movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half. I swear you'll be cheering as you watch Denzel Washington dispatch the wrong doers. His performance is nothing short of Excellent. The ending (no spoilers, OK!!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the year's best movies. A \\\"must own\\\" for a DVD collection! 9* out of 10\", \"This has to be one of the best, if not the best film i have seen for a very, very long time. Had enough action to satisfy an fan, and yet the plot was very good. I really enjoyed the film,and had me hooked from start to finish.  Added blood and gore in there, but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the film, and even had a tear jerker ending for many people i should think.  It is a must watch for anyone. Seen many reviews, slating the film, but to be fair, most the films that get bad reviews, turn out to be some of the best. this proves it once again.  Rent this film, buy this film, just go out and watch this film. You will not be disappointed.\", \"...dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial, brain-dead and pointless. The film is excellent, the acting by both Denzel and Dakota (she will go sky high, trust me on that)are just fabulous, and the plot is mind blowing. Actually \\\"fabulous\\\" is a small word to use for such talented actors. The film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional, a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film. If you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films, you still haven't watched your favorite one yet...Trust me, in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling. The film is awesome, see it, rent it, buy it or whatever...just don't miss it\", \"Certainly one of the finest movies I have seen for quite some time. Exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film. Denzel Washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date, and the rest of the cast perform beautifully. Christopher Walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as I would have liked. A story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love. This is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener. All in all, a truly gripping film from beginning to end. Highly recommended!\", \"### Spoilers! ###   What is this movie offering? Out of control editing and cinematography that matches up with a terrible plot. It is sad to see Denzel Washington's talents go wasted in trashes like this.We are certainly hinted how the Mexicans cannot save themselves, outside forces needed, possibly militaristic, American ones. And we know the father is a shady character, he is a Mexican after all, unlike the wife who appreciates Creasey more because he is American. He killed all of them thinking she died. And did she? Of course, she won't, she is a young kid and you are not supposed to hurt the sensibilities of the Hollywood fan. The trade off scene was the only thing that prevents me from rating it below the \\\"implausibly successful\\\"(as some critic pointed out)'Taken'. The nausea of such movies will take time to go. It is in the rating of such movies that we have to doubt IMDb's credulity.7.7 for a movie like this and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho. Go figure! Mine will be in the range of 3.5-4.0\", \"Trust me, this is one let down movie that you want to avoid and this comes from one huge Denzel Washington fan. The frustrating part is that it's 1/3 of a GREAT film. The first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl he's paid to protect. The trailers to this movie all mention that she is kidnapped. So, I'm giving nothing away when I say that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess after she's kidnapped. Whatever the director was trying to accomplish, all he succeeds in doing is making the audience literally nauseous. Rapid, frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half-hour as Creasy tracks down the perpetrators. These cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is to jolt you out of the story. I'm sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story signified a change in Creasy's character and signified that a different movie was to follow. Well, he was right. The movie that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap. The result of which is a depressing ending that ruins even the quality first forty minutes of the movie.\", \"Don't get me wrong, I love action and revenge flicks, I've seen many of them since I was a kid, including Dolph Lundgren's latest \\\"The Mechanik\\\" which is quite good. And Tony Scott certainly know how to use a camera and even might be a genius shooting and editing films.  But with \\\"Man on Fire\\\" (and even more then with \\\"Domino\\\"), Scott shows that rather than using his film-making \\\"genius\\\" skills intelligently, he uses it puposelessly to show off and compensate a lack of substance that his material doesn't offer him. \\\"Man of Fire\\\" is close to 2 hours and half when it really should have been at least an hour less.  The way Scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you (the audience) to sit through his film because his constant camera moves and flashes really are a torture for the eye and makes you wanna leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes into it.  At times where the MPAA and studios have questionable attitudes regarding ratings, violence and making PG-13 movies, I find also suspicious that a $70 million movie is made of a B-movie script with a character who cuts fingers, puts a bomb in a man's ass and blows a guy's hand with a shotgun, all this to avenge the death of a little girl who ISN'T even dead! Go figure then why a studio will pass a better script because of the language or violence... Thus said...\", \"The thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy, shaky, camera-work and the fast, confusing cutting. I am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh proof with most of their movies, but in this case there was WAY too much. It seems like the jump-cuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over Mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end. For a movie that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that it's story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development. That is another disappointing aspect of the movie. If I want to watch an over the top action flick I do not need any justification, but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of Denzel Washington's character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances. The first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb archetypes and clich\\u00e9s are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens. So the movie does not work either on the level of a believable drama/thriller , nor as a pure action movie. Of course the movie is not as bad as some oft the totally messed up blockbusters of the last years, but I absolutely cannot understand why so many people claim this movie to be something fresh and so cool. For a video clip it is way too long and for a movie it has too little substance.\"], \"review_score\": [7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10, 10, 10, 8, 10, 10, 7, 7, 7, 10, 9, 8, 8, 10, 9, 10, 10, 10, 4, 1, 2, 4], \"review_category\": [\"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 8.166666666666666}, \"Marty\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0048356\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"MASH\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0066026\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Meet John Doe\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0033891\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Metro\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0119664\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Metropolis\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0017136\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Mobsters\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0102460\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Monkeybone\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0166276\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"My Mother Dreams the Satan's Disciples in New York\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0177023\", \"total_review_count\": 1, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"Appalling because a student film had won the Academy Award for best live-action short.

It thinks it's a lot better than it is. So, apparently, does the AMPAS.  Maybe I shouldn't be at all surprised that it won an Oscar. Winning one these days seems to be more of an insult than a compliment.  \"], \"review_score\": [0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Mumford\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0140397\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Mummy\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0120616\", \"total_review_count\": 1, \"total_rating_count\": 1, \"review_content\": [\"There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets.

Jeez. It is mindless, it isn't polished and it is (as I am reading) wasted on some. The cast of this movie plays their characters to the 'T' (If you watched Permanent Midnight and became a Ben Stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed). These are misunderstood, well-intentioned misfits trying to save the city/world with nothing but grit and determination. The problem is they don't realize their limits until the big showdown and that's the point! This is 3 times the movie that The Spy Who Shagged Me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group, likely the same people who feel the first AP movie pales in comparison to the sequel. I just don't get it. The jokes work on more then one level; if you didn't get it I know what level you're at.\", \"This is an very good movie. This is one that I would rent over and over again. It is not like your normal superhero movie. This movie blends comedy, action and great special effects. It even has a person in it that does a lot of voices on The Simpsons. William H. Macy is the bomb.\", \"I can't say that this film deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol being heaped on it by some reviewers. Yes, it's bogged down by an overly-padded running time, hamfisted editing, and an overreliance on cheeseball special effects. And it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience member to sit through it without checking his or her watch.   On the other hand, it's also got some laugh-out-loud funny lines, a talented and earnest cast, and the classic underdog premise. Macy, Stiller, and Azaria are brilliant as the \\\"core\\\" team, and Garofalo and Studi do superb work adding conflict and variety to the team. I can't say Reubens or Mitchell added much to the film overall, though each had a few chances to shine.   The plot, as I said above, is your classic \\\"underdog-makes-good\\\" stuff. No surprises there, since you know they're going to triumph. What makes it worthwhile is not the absurd, gaudy heroes and villains, but the dialogue and interplay between the characters. Underneath it all, these people are children at heart, who just want to do right. The best scenes in the film give this film its emotional grounding. Look at Azaria's relationship with his long-suffering mother; Macy's endearing innocence in his unwillingness to accept Cap. Amazing's secret identity; Stiller's rage (not unlike that one weird, spazzy kid you once knew who'd always go into quivering, impotent rages on the playground); Garofalo's desire to avenge her father. This childlike belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place, is the true appeal of super-hero comics; and underneath its parodic exterior, \\\"Mystery Men\\\" shows us why these hackneyed comic-book tropes matter to so many.  It never really gels into a satisfying whole, due to the huge number of half-baked subplots (romance, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the main plot is such loopy fun that it makes up for that. The fact that it's supposed to be good, nonsensical fun seems to be lost on some of the reviewers here, so I'll issue a caveat: if you're the type of viewer who finds his enjoyment of an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon ruined by the unexplained and illogical (\\\"Am I to believe this is some sort of.. *snort*... _magic_ xylophone?\\\"), then you are far too literal-minded and humorless for this film. Go rent a Sandler film instead.  (7/10)\", \"OK. There are people who should not see this movie.  1) Don't see it if you don't like satire or black humour. 2) Don't like it if you got offended by _The Watchmen_. 3) Don't see it if you want a serious superhero movie.  The rest of you, run, don't walk, to see _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's quirky, it's a delightful sendup of every bad superhero cliche known to man. Occasional forays into junior-high humour don't ruin the tongue-in-cheek low-key fun of Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller, and Hank Azaria, as well as a couple of amusing smaller parts by Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (Good to see Louise Lasser getting work, too.) I laughed all the way through. Utterly unserious, somewhat weird, but -good-.\", \"I've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time. \\\"Mystery Men\\\" takes its place among the classic comic-strip spoofs on TV like \\\"Batman\\\" and \\\"Captain Nice\\\" and cartoons like \\\"Underdog\\\" and \\\"Super Chicken.\\\" The same spirit lives in all of them: the comic tongue-in-cheek tone; the courage to aim for the heroic in life at the risk of looking ridiculous; the not-so-sure-footed way that these characters manage to prevail over their adversaries. It's the misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and the ordinary, and it's wonderful to see it glow so high and bright here.  \\\"Mystery Men\\\" opens on a party at a nursing home. I wish Kinka Usher had had the sense to give more energy and life to the old people in the scene. As it is, it looks like something George Romero might have devised. We need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else, or it feels patronizing. By the time the Red Eyes crash the festivities, you half expect Tom Waits who plays a weapons inventor with a penchant for ladies in their eighties to stand up and shout: \\\"Just what this party needs--a little excitement!\\\" If writer Neil Cuthbert had any sense, he would have had Waits mixing it up with the intruders and egging on the partiers to do the same. It would have made for a rousing beginning, and a better introduction of the troublesome trio: the Shoveler (William Macy); the Blue Raja (Hank Azaria); and Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day.   There are many other problems to \\\"Mystery Men\\\" than I care to go into; among them that the villain Casanova Frankenstein needs to have as cultivated a sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in this movie, and he doesn't. Geoffrey Rush is the wrong actor for the part; he needs to be way over the top to make the conflict between good and evil a galvanic one. And Rush has never exhibited a talent for the outre. You hope for the ripe theatrics of a John Lithgow in \\\"The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai\\\" or the dry, debonair diffidence of a Paul Freeman in \\\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\\" Instead what we get is pastiche; something half-baked and not fully realized.  There are too many ideas running through \\\"Mystery Men\\\" for anyone to tie them neatly together, and that may be its deepest problem. But whatever kind of a mess it is is the kind of mess I love. Ben Stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the roles he takes. This one is no exception, but he goes at it with such conviction that you come away feeling that he'd learned something about comedy growing up in a household run by Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. His Roy is related to all the put-upon, overly sensitive, chronically defensive types that Woody Allen made popular. And whether it's wheedling his way into the affections of the waitress at his favorite hangout (the sleek Claire Forslani), or questioning the wisdom of a fellow superhero (Wes Studi as the Sphinx), or giving a new member of their \\\"elite\\\" group (Jeaneane Garofalo in what are possibly her funniest moments on screen) a hard time, he makes it always fun to watch. I couldn't exactly say that about him in \\\"There's Something About Mary.\\\"  Jeaneane Garofalo proves with this performance that she should have been the star of \\\"One True Thing,\\\" not Renee Zellweger. I don't think I have ever seen funnier exchanges between a daughter and father (okay, so he's dead and his skull is in a bowling ball, so sue me) in the movies. And the funny part about this role is that it feels like a screwball reprise of Emily Watson's spellbinding talks with God in \\\"Breaking the Waves.\\\" And in this version, the girl doesn't die, and bells don't ring in your head.  William H. Macy does something very difficult; he makes stolid magnetic. You understand right away what's attracted Jenifer Lewis' Lucille to Eddie. You can also understand her exasperation. The barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge, but when Eddie's adorable, half-breed son looks up at his father and says \\\"I believe in you, Daddy.\\\" to which Lucille sighs and exclaims, \\\"Roland, don't encourage your father,\\\" you feel like standing and hailing Neil Cuthbert as a first-rate wit.   With Hank Azaria (whose only moment of note in film up to this point was his bare behind in \\\"The Birdcage\\\") and Louise Lasser (Has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in \\\"Bananas\\\" and \\\"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman?\\\") as son and mother who share a fondness for silverware; Greg Kinnear as Captain Amazing and Ricky Jay as his publicist; Kel Mitchell as \\\"Invisible Boy\\\"; Paul Reubens as \\\"The Spleen;\\\" and Lena Olin who, if she didn't have the few lines in this movie that she has, would seem to be visiting the set.\", \"I saw this movie the day it came out last year. Hilarious I thought. Well, now it's on video and I saw it again. I love this movie! The things they do are sometimes dumb but that's what makes it my third favorite movie of all time. The special effects are okay, but the witty dialog will have you rolling. I'm the kind of person that'll say i'm inspired by this movie, so if you like dramas and other stuff, avoid. But for all others, enjoy! The acting is superb. Hank Azaria is hands down the best (he's neither a commie, nor a fruit) followed by Ben Stiller (uh, don't correct me. it sickens me) and then William H. Macy delivering his best performance (outshining fargo) Everybody has praised everyone from macy to garafalo, but I think Kel Mitchell was pretty good as Invisible Boy. Two problems: The most boring part of the film is the subplot of the romance between Stiller and Claire Forlani, and the Casanova parole hearing. Some scenes absolutely advance the story in no way, but they're a blast. Kinka and especially the writers tend to drag on a scene untill all it's hilarity is gone, but bam they switch and you're ready for more. I swear after seeing this, you will be tired from the explosive climax (which I think was pretty cool) The camera is pretty cool also, moving at a furious pace with the actors. Also, Tom Waits delivers an outstanding performance (he has this kinda cool bad hero coolness to him) and like someone else said, the best parts are when the characters show some humanness to them. Captain Amazing is pretty funny, (especially his speech to Casanova about his perfect plan-I was rolling) and rush is pretty cool as Casanova. One beef: the funniest comedian ever (eddie izzard) is almost wasted, but his heart is in the right place. So all in all, a wonderful movie. I give it twenty stars and hope that someday, everyone will see the brilliance in the film's best parody, the Six Million Dollar Man one. Laughing right now as I think about it. 20/10\", \"There are many problems with Mystery Men. First of all there are too many different characters for all of them to be given complex or even interesting personalities. The special effects detract from the story and are not really that special. Paul Reubens is wasted in a pathetic, juvenile role as a character who merely farts and speaks in an inaudible accent.  Now onto the decent parts. William H Macy, three heavenly words, and his performance as the shoveler is pitch perfect. The sphinx is an exceptionally funny character who is only mysterious and merely spouts out the traditional mystical proverbs. Ben Stiller is very amusing as well, showing a weak character trying to make it into the big leagues of superheroes. All of the characters do, and that is an area which I found particuarly ironic. That is because all of the actors are Indie film actors trying to make it into the big leagues of Hollywood.  To be honest, the reason I thought it failed at the box-office is that America doesn't get irony.  All in all I loved the film, but I feel it would have worked better if more effort was put into tweaking the script rather than having unneccesary CGI landscapes and effects.\", \"MYSTERY MEN has got to be THE stupidest film I've ever seen, but what a film! I thought it was fabulous, excellent and impressive. It was funny, well-done and nice to see ridiculous Super Heroes for a change! And being able to pull it off! This was great! I'll definitely watch it again!\", \"I've seen Mystery Men cop a bit of stick in the press and with the general public ( take the imdb vote for instance), but my overall feeling is that Mystery Men is more fun than most films, definitely wittier than most so-called comedy films and very nearly 'clever'.  The cast is superb; Greg Kinnear is excellent, as are Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Kinnear's limo scene with Ricky Jay is perfect 'spoiled movie star' and he imbues his character with the right balance of comic book quality and realism to make him work.  I will admit the pacing is a little off in places, and visuals are certainly very flash bang, possibly to the detriment of further characterisation, but at the end of the day, this is high concept film making - it's about the little moments \\\"What's Up Tiger Lily?\\\" - and there are so many great ones in this film to make it worth repeated viewing.\", \"A lot of the user comments i have seen on the IMDB for this movie don't really do it justice. First of all, let me just say that this movie is not to be taken seriously. It's supposed to be a fun, yet stupid movie, that doesn't require one to think, only to enjoy it. If you watch this movie with the intent to see a masterpiece in either filmmaking or in humour, then you will be sorely disappointed. Yet, if you want to just watch a goofy movie with some talented actors/actresses, and some good catch-phrases, then you will enjoy it.\", \"The first thing I thought after watching \\\"Mystery Men\\\" was how could this movie be so unpopular? I found this movie so adorable and funny that it's status as a bomb defies logic. Well, I hope that in the future it becomes a cult hit, and you can count me amoung it's fans.  Simply put, and without giving too much away, this movie does for comic books what \\\"the Princess Bride\\\" did for fairy tales and \\\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\\\" did for classic cartoons. That should give you a more accurate idea of the tone of the movie then the marketing commitee it was unfortunately signed to (this is one of those cases like \\\"the Iron Giant\\\" where the studio had no clue what it had on it's hands). Rent it the next time you're in the mood for something a little offbeat. You won't listen to the BeeGees in the same light ever again.\", \"The directing behind this film was fantastic for a comedy. Many of the scenes appear to be out of a comic book and much darker (visually -- not story wise) than what I expected. Granted, this may not be the funniest movie ever made, especially if you are into very crude sexist jokes as this has very little of that (compared to others like Something About Mary or American Pie). As you rewatch it, several jokes stand out and get funnier. If you have ever read a comic book or watched a comic book-type movie (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and liked them, you will probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the movie. If you didn't like them, you may like the respectful ridicule that this film has for those. If you did like this movie, the dvd has some cool extras. (8/10)\", \"******WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**************  So who are these \\\"Mystery Men?\\\" Simply put, the Mystery Men are a group of sub-Heroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while botching both their real identities and their super identities. The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works construction during the day, and at night, leaves his wife and kids at home while he cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique Shovel-fighting style. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villians by night, if his mom isn't keeping him busy with the latest snooping. Mr. Furious works in a junk yard to earn his pay, then takes out his frustration on his friends at night, tossing ill-conceived one-liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry (leaving everyone to wonder, So What?). Ben Stiller breathes such life into this character, you can't help but love him.  These three spend their nights trying to capture that 'moment of glory' they've dreamed about... becoming real Super Heroes. Obviously, it could happen. Champion City has Captain Amazing, after all... a flying, fighting super-cop with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two. Greg Kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle-aged sellout trying to recapture his fans attention in the twilight of his career.  To bring back that 'extra magic' that might win the endorsements again, C.A. frees Casanova Frankenstein, a WAAAAAY over-the-top menace played to chilling perfection by Goeffrey Rush. This lunatic genius has created a 'psychofrakulator' to warp Champion City into a reflection of his own insanities... and ends up capturing C.A. within hours of his release from prison. This leaves only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with such henchmen as the Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio are going to need a little help.  Recruiting commences, and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles in with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father; the Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who CLAIMS to turn invisible when ABSOLUTELY NO ONE is looking at him; the Spleen (Paul Reubens), granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the much underused Sphinx (Wes Studi), who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind, then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wise.  This film really is a cross-genre romp. Anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle. This is a spoof/parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-Burton sets recycled endlessly (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up. But at the same time, it is a serious superhero flick, as well. Both at once. While not a necessarily unique idea in itself (for example, this movie is in some ways reflective of D.C. Comic's short-lived Inferior Five work), it is fairly innovative for the big screen. It offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if superheroes were real, so would these guys be real. If the Big Guy with the S were flying around New York City, you'd see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis. Sure, the Shoveller fights pretty well, and the Blue Raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world. But does that make them genuine super-heroes? Only in their minds.  This movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one. Inevitable, when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics. One-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of. Particularly marvelous is the dialogue by Janeane Garofalo with her bowling ball/father. Yet, it isn't a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes. It mixes in a dose of drama, of discovery and of romance, but never really ventures fully into any of it.  What really makes Mystery Men a good film, in the end, is that it is very engaging. The weak/lame good guys are eventually justified and, for one shining moment, really become super-heroes; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism (as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to label the film, then the film can be a great romp.  Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani comes off as bored and directionless as Mr. Furious' love interest, in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience. Tom Waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor Dr. Heller, although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone. And the villians are never more than gun-toting lackeys (a point of which is made in the film). The cinematography is choppy and disjointed (such as happens in the average comic book, so it is excusable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery, and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well.  Yet, overall, this film is incredible. You probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest.  8/10 in my opinion.\", \"A film about wannabee's, never-were's and less-than-heroes making it against all odds. Where have we heard that before. But when the unfortunates are the Shoveller, the Blue Raja and Mr.Furious you know this is not your conventional rags to riches story.  A classic performance by Eddie Izzard as Tony P. one of the Disco boys leaders and Geoffrey Rush as Arch Villain shows actual thought went into the casting.   Even Greg Kinnear, at first glance an odd choice for the role of Captain Amazing turns out spot on.  Watch this film if you're sick of comic-gone-film stereotypes. Why couldn't anger be a super power?\", \"I really didn't expect much from this movie, but it wasn't bad; actually it was quite good. This movie contained a couple of the funniest bits of writing I have ever seen from a motion picture. Now am not saying this is one of the funniest movies of all time, but I laughed pretty hard at some parts. \\\"The police ruled my father's death a suicide. They said he fell down an elevator shaft. Onto some bullets\\\". Now this movie is not for everybody, its mostly stupid humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball; so if you hated these movies I would probably recommend you to steer clear. Overall it was an enjoyable movie, about a group of superhero wannabes, who end up becoming real heroes in the end. It's a vastly overrated comedy that many people probably haven't seen yet, because like me before viewing it expected it to be utter garbage. After viewing this film, I finally understand why this movie was able to assemble such a superstar cast which includes Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria, and even that kid from Good Burger. It's because Mystery Man is full of excellent comedic writing period 7 out of 10. A very big surprise.\", \"I make just one apology for this film: there are far, far, too many wide angle close-ups, and if they irritate you beyond endurance, fair enough. They drove ME barmy for the first ten minutes or so. But after that I made a kind of a truce with the terrible cinematography; and long before the end of the film, I had ceased to care. This is too rich a comedy to be destroyed so easily. It's hilarious, it's witty, the comic delivery of ALL of the cast is flawless, and however much Usher peers at his characters through a cold, fish-eye lens - HE may not care for them much - he manages to present them with warmth. `Mystery Men' is, in fact, not only funnier, not only more clever, but also deeper, than anyone seems to have given it credit for being. The jokes in the Austin Powers movies, for instance, as well as being less funny than the jokes here, are also much more toothless. The satire of `Mystery Men' bites when there's something worth biting and gnaws gently when there isn't. It doesn't mock just any old thing. Which is why, contrary to what some (I must regard them as unobservant) critics have said, it never runs out of ideas.  The `super' heroes are an attractive bunch. Sure, they're second-rate, but they're not merely second rate. The Blue Rajah, for instance, does nothing but throw cutlery at people, and he isn't THAT good at it. On the other hand, neither is he comically bad. He's better in his limited field than most people, and he DOES practise diligently. He's not a buffoon, which makes him a much funnier character than if he was. If Superman is Christ in a cape, the Mystery Men are all the minor demigods from the foothills of Mount Olympus, in capes. Much funnier; also much more endearing.\", \"This was different, that's for sure. Just look at the cast! Talk about oddballs.  William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars, although a bunch of actors almost share the spotlight, in this farce about superhero-wannabees. The most outrageous was played by Paul Reubens of \\\"Pee Wee Herman\\\" fame.  There is lots of humor, garish colors and no lulls. It's a pretty entertaining, lightweight comedy with nothing but goofy characters, all of whom want to be heroes a la Superman, Batman, Spiderman, you name. They have talents in strange areas, however, that the real heroes don't (and don't want to!). It's silly, but you know that going on.  It's also a film you can watch in installments and not really miss any continuity. It's a long movie for one so hectic, so taking a break here and there is okay. The language was tame so kids could enjoy this, too. In fact, I don't recall any swearing in here, except the guy in the theater next to me who kept uttering, \\\"What a dumb, f---ing movie.\\\" I thought it was fun two hours but I'd rather watch it on DVD and take a few breaks.\", \"This movie deserved better It's great fun, has some wonderful jokes and sight gags, some in-stuff for the \\\"Geeks\\\" amongst us (And we know who we are), and the effects are indeed effectual. Watching Paul Reubens fart in the face of an Academy Award winner is worth the price of admission alone. I never read the comics series before I saw the movie, but have since. as good as they are, I still recommend MM the film. (Although having the Flaming Carrot as a character would have been cool, too) Greg Kinnear is, well,...amazing as Captain Amazing, and NO ONE ELSE could be The Shoveller except William H. Macy My favorite line in the film? \\\"We've got a blind date with Destiny. And it looks like she's ordered the lobster.\\\" See this film. BUY this film! It's only 5 bucks and some change at your local Wal-Mart. You'll thank me. Really you will. Oh, and Ms. Garafolo is in it. THAT ALONE makes it watch-worthy\", \"I saw this in theaters and absolutely adored it. Geoffery Rush gave the best performance as a super villain that I have ever seen since Gene Hackman as Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a match maid in heaven. This film also introduced me to William H. Macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was great as the Blue Raja, and I especially loved that the character wasn't really British. The scene with him and telling his mom that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes. I loved the fact that The Bowler talked to the ball. Some of the funniest stuff involved Stiller and his character Mr. Furious's false rage, and the fact that his threats and one-liners were all gibberish, and that they never made any sense. I could barely stop myself from applauding when he said \\\"fraculater, Freinken-puss,\\\" was said. But one of the things I most enjoyed was that Captain Amazing actually dies in the movie. I HIGHLY recommend this film for any occasion, and I give it my own personal two-thumbs-up.\", \"Forget depth of meaning, leave your logic at the door, and have a great time with this maniacally funny, totally absurdist, ultra-campy live-action \\\"cartoon\\\". MYSTERY MEN is a send-up of every superhero flick you've ever seen, but its unlikely super-wannabes are so interesting, varied, and well-cast that they are memorable characters in their own right. Dark humor, downright silliness, bona fide action, and even a touching moment or two, combine to make this comic fantasy about lovable losers a true winner. The comedic talents of the actors playing the Mystery Men -- including one Mystery Woman -- are a perfect foil for Wes Studi as what can only be described as a bargain-basement Yoda, and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most off-the-wall (and bizarrely charming) villains ever to walk off the pages of a Dark Horse comic book and onto the big screen. Get ready to laugh, cheer, and say \\\"huh?\\\" more than once.... enjoy!\", \"This is a great movie. I love it more each time i watch. Most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags, but mystery men has so much integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again -- as Ben Stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo, or Hank Azaria says good-bye to Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush flashes his fuhrer choreography, or Tom Waits mumbles while he watches the news report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses a kiss from Paul Reubens -- is a pleasure. This is pitch perfect ensemble acting. The story develops directly and consistently, the action sequences are creative and not too dominant, all the set-ups payoff by the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, watch it again, and if you haven't then get started. You can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, the tryouts scene. Too much good stuff!)\", \"Director Kinka Usher stays true to his own credo, \\\"Play it straight and they will laugh,\\\" and with the help of a superb cast has crafted what should become the #1 cult film of all time, `Mystery Men.' When an evil villain, Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) is released from a mental institution, captures the local superhero, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), and threatens to take over Champion City, three wanna-be superheroes, Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), The Shoveler (William H. Macy) and The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) come to the rescue. Frankenstein has been joined by a myriad assortment of underworld scum, however, and has become a formidable opponent. The trio realize that help is needed, and decide to recruit; what they end up with is nothing less than the most unforgettable team of `superheroes' ever assembled in the history of the cinema. Mr. Furious has his rage; The Shoveler, his shovel; The Blue Raja flings silverware (mainly forks, and the occasional spoon, but never a knife); the Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell) can turn invisible as long as no one is watching; the Sphinx (Wes Studi), a heavy hitter from down south, is very mysterious and can break guns in half with his mind. Maybe; the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo) can fling a ball with deadly accuracy; and The Spleen (Paul Reubens) wields flatulence that can incapacitate an entire room. This is a brilliant ensemble piece that delivers the laughs without ever becoming condescending or patronizing the audience, while playing it straight at all times. The dialogue is witty, and the performances given by Stiller, Macy, Azaria and Garofalo are exemplary. There is a number of memorable, hilarious scenes, especially the one in which they throw a pool party and barbecue to recruit, and conduct interviews with a stupefying assemblage of applicants; and another, in a bar, when the Bowler has a conversation with her long-dead father, whose skull has been implanted in her bowling ball. The funniest of all, however, has to be when the team actually attempts to rescue Captain Amazing. But these are only examples, for the entire movie is composed of one hilarious scene after another, laced with subtle humor that will keep you laughing and thinking about it for a long time. The real secret of it's success, though, is that Usher keeps it all real; the relationships between the characters are true, and the whole concept of being a `Superhero' is played as being entirely reasonable, which somehow gives a sense of credibility to the entire proceedings. In this world, the aspirations of Mr. Furious and the rest are tenable, and Usher keeps the laughs coming without ever resorting to slapstick or mere sight gags. The solid supporting cast includes Lena Olin (Dr. Annabel Leek), Eddie Izzard (Tony P.), Tom Waits (Doc Heller), Claire Forlani (Monica), Louise Lasser (The Blue Raja's mother), Jenifer Lewis (Lucille) and Pras (Tony C.). `Mystery Men' is a truly inspired movie that can be seen over and over again, with a new chuckle to be had with every viewing, guaranteed. In the immortal words of the Sphinx, `We are number one! All others are number two, or lower.' Is it an Oscar-worthy movie? Hardly; but for a good time and a lot of laughs, treat yourself to this masterwork of comedy; it's the real deal, and you won't regret it. I rate this one 10/10.\", \"This movie was a brilliant concept. It was original, cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who aren't really 'conformist' movie pickers. Don't get me wrong - there are some great movies that have wide appeal, but when you move into watching a movie based on \\\"everyone else is watching it\\\" - you know you're either a tween or don't really have an opinion. This had a lovely subtle humor - despite most people probably looking only at the obvious. The actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and I thought there was a lot more \\\"personal\\\" personality in this film. Has appeal for kids, as well as adults. Esp. nice to find a good movie that's not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos! A great film, not to be overlooked based on public consumption. This one is a must buy.\", \"Though I can't claim to be a comic book fanatic, I have read my share, so I guess I'm part of the audience of this film, and I wasn't disappointed. It does run out of steam near the end, it's almost overflowing with ideas, and it seems like Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, was left on the cutting room floor. Also, a little of Hank Azaria's Blue Raja can go a long way. Still, it's easy to forgive all of these faults when you have a film which is this much fun. All the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles, especially William H. Macy as the straight-arrow Shoveler, and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike some, I found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier. I also liked how disco was the music of choice of the bad guys; somehow, it seemed appropriate.\", \"In the history of movies based on comic books, \\\"Mystery Men\\\" is one of the most underrated ones. This is no regular comic superhero movie! It follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes, which include Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens). \\\"Mystery Men\\\" spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like \\\"Superman\\\" or \\\"Batman,\\\" such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities. Most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. So it looks as if director Kinka Usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to. I found \\\"Mystery Men\\\" to be visually stimulating and very funny. Even if it doesn't turn into a franchise, it's still a joy to watch!\", \"As a comic book reader, who still sees myself as a total kid at heart, I admit I might have been a bit biased towards this movie. I mean, there hasn't been a good superhero movie out for quite some time (NOTE: Batman Forever was NOT a good superhero movie). I really wanted this film to be good, and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema (read Blair Witch Project) I wasn't disappointed.  Mystery Men was definitely not a high-effects, tension-filled action flick, it was a comedy. And on that basis, it was a success. It had everyone in the small theater laughing, and got applause and laughs right through the final scene. Stiller and Garofolo are hilarious together, as always, and Azaria adds just the right touch of craziness. William H. Macy plays a great straight man, while Kel Mitchell and the fart-powered Paul Rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happy.  Though the sets are bizarre (and at times seem like ripoffs from both Batman and Blade Runner), and some of the jokes are obvious, it is still just plain funny. There are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer off-guard, and bring tears from the belly-laughers among us.  I definitely recommend this movie. Although not an all-time classic, it is twice as funny as the latest Austin Powers retread. The writing is good, and the cast is GREAT. If you're worried, plan on the matinee and pay less, but either way you'll be pleasantly surprised. I mean, who among us doesn't root for the losers once in a while?\", \"Mystery Men is one of those movies that gets funnier over time. There is a naive innocence and \\\"niceness\\\" to the characters. It has become part of our family \\\"culture,\\\" and we quote the characters often. It is my favorite film of the last two years. My kids are 13 and 11 and we all three love this film. Great acting and comedy. We love Galaxy Quest and Monty Python flicks too. Okay, we're not talking intellectual here, just Family bonding!\", \"This movie is a lot of fun. What makes it great especially are two things: one is the straightforward way the characters embrace the stereotypes, with discussions of their costumes and superpowers. There's an endearing earnestness to the parody that's very appealing; the second is basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves particular note as the object of Mr. Furious's desires. There's a boatload of talent here. I realize some with high expectations may have been disappointed, but this movie is a lot of fun, and kind of sweet.\", \"I saw \\\"Mystery Men\\\" on my birthday in 1999 while I was away on vacation. When I came back home, I went to see it again. Keep in mind, I was twelve, but at that time it was the coolest movie ever. I even collected the ultra-rare action figures (I have them all except for the Bowler, which is the hardest to find. They made Mr. Furious, The Shoveler, The Blue Raja, The Spleen and Captain Amazing, in case your wondering. There IS a William H. Macy action figure in existence!). I've watched it many times over the years and it still remains a favorite of mine, due mostly to fond childhood memories. It's not a perfect movie, but it definitely deserves another look and perhaps a cult following.  The story: a bunch of low-level superheroes save the day. This was executed again in the mediocre, direct-to-video \\\"The Specials\\\" as well. But this is the other end of the spectrum: big budget (huge budget, almost $100 Million I think) studio comedy. Yes, the effects are overblown and the huge sets and wonderful production design are a bit much considering the plot. But don't think this as a stupid, special effects-y superhero movie--it's a PARODY. They fight a villain named Cassanova Frankenstein, people. He has a psychofrakulator, whatever that is (it's a doomsday device, he'll take over the world, yada yada.) And resident superhero Captain Amazing (a Zapp Brannigan-esque Greg Kinnear, with commercial-product-logos on his costume, nice touch) is kidnapped. Time for the Mystery Men: Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller, gets mad), The Shoveller (William H. Macy, beats people with shovels), The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria, British, throws forks), The Bowler (Janeane Garafolo, bowls), Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell, guess what he does), The Spleen (the great Paul Reubens, farts), and The Sphinx (Wes Studi, cuts guns in half with his mind, I am not kidding). The rest of the fantastic cast of character actors includes Geoffrey Rush as Cassanova, Lena Olin heavily edited out as Cassanova's bride, and the one and only Tom Waits as a crazy weapons dealer. So...with Macy, Kinnear, Olin, and Rush there are four Oscar-nominees (and one winner) and Tom freakin' Waits! It's not perfect though. It's overlong and there are some gushes of corniness here and there (The Shoveller's full of them).  The dialogue definitely outweighs the physical comedy, which is sometimes lacking (there's a guy who farts for his power, case closed). The dialogue is definitely a highlight, the cyclical ramblings of the Sphinx, the mixed metaphors of Mr. Furious, etc. It's downright a funny movie, (it will almost make you forget that this was the film that let \\\"All Star\\\" by Smashmouth out into the world.)   Unfortunately, the film did not do as well with critics and audiences as it should have. A sequel was originally planned (the film is in fact based on a comic book and characters from \\\"The Flaming Carrot\\\" comics. The Flaming Carrot was planned for the sequel I believe) but this did not do well at the box office. It could have been a hard sell, a superhero comedy with the guy from \\\"There's Something About Mary.\\\" It also could have been the fact that it was released on the same day as \\\"The Sixth Sense\\\"--which ended up being the biggest hit for the month of August--as well as \\\"The Thomas Crown Affair.\\\" Two other misunderstood classics were released on the same crowded weekend, oddly enough--\\\"Dick\\\" and \\\"The Iron Giant.\\\" Critics gave MM passable reviews, but it was quickly forgotten. Sadly enough, on Comedy Central's Roast of Jerry Stiller, comedian Jeffrey Ross commented to Ben Stiller that, \\\"I saw 'Mystery Men' and I fired MY agent.\\\" Ben is then seen to mouth the words, \\\"I should have to.\\\" Don't listen to him. Give \\\"Mystery Men\\\" a chance.\", \"This movie is pure guano. Mom always said if you can't say anything nice... but even Mom would say I had to do my part to warn others of this movie.  I can guarantee this is the film that Geoffrey Rush wishes would just go away. I would hope that Greg Kinnear fired his agent..from a cannon for giving him the script. After this Ben Stiller is probably praying for someone to pitch \\\"There's Still Something About Mary.\\\" I have always been a fan of Wes Studi's, thank whatever you hold holy that he wore a mask through the film so maybe people won't identify the film with him.  It starts of promisingly with a stylistic spoof of the cinematography of the Batman films and then just loses something...like a coherent plot and half decent effects.  The jokes are telegraphed an hour before the punchline comes, and even then they fall flat. If you want to see an effective spoof of the comic book world see \\\"Chasing Amy\\\".  RUN!

It's the kind of movie that you walk in to expecting a more mature \\\"Dumb and Dumber\\\" what with temporarily insane waitress goes on a cross country adventure while avoiding crooks trying to kill her.  The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams. The best part about \\\"Nurse Betty\\\" is it's unpredictability. Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.\", \"After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play the hitmen who killed her husband and are now on her trial. The trick to the film is that Freeman and Zellweger are really parallel characters. While Zellweger falls in love with the image of the handsome and polite Dr. Dave Ravell on a soap opera, Freeman idealizes Betty. Nurse Betty is a brillant film, full of life, humor, love and graphic violence. My Grade: 10/10.\", \"Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately. It was funny, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, & the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real. The story took such twist & turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula movies, see Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!\", \"This movie just might make you cooooo. The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger)is the lone \\\"acceptable\\\" soap groupie out there. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George... And speak of the devil; \\\"looker\\\" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well. While Charlie (Morgan Freeman) makes you wish for his wish to come true, Wesley (Chris Rock) makes you want to tie him to a chair. And Rosa(Tia Texada)takes you back to those luminous grade-school friendships. The sheriff encourages you to feed him donuts and loose his name. The remainder of the cast fits well. Never one to do the same movie twice, Nurse Betty is the exception. One of these long, cold, needing to smile about something winter days.\", \"Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. Neil Labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while Ren\\u00e9e Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.\", \"A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?  The answer become less clear as the film goes on.  Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.  This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.  Chris Rock \\u0096 though as foul-mouthed as usual \\u0096 is fairly subdued as Wesley. He is able to sublimate his manic energy and it only occasionally surfaces and always when it is needed most.  There are some interesting allusions: the first time you see Betty she is dressed almost exactly like Dorothy Gale from the `Wizard of Oz' \\u0096 then later in the film she is compared to Dorothy when she says she has never been out of Kansas before. At one point the song that Doris Day was best known for, \\u0091Que Sera Sera' is on the soundtrack and then later Charlie (Morgan Freeman) describes her as having \\u0091a whole Doris Day thing going on.'  This is an extremely quirky film with good performances by everyone including the supporting cast.  It has a surprising ending that, as contrary as it sounds, is actually fairly predictable.  If for no other reason see this film just to listen to the master of the human voice: Morgan Freeman.\", \"Goof: Factual error  When Charlie walks out of the room to commit suicide he takes his gun with a silencer. After a few seconds we hear a loud bang from the same gun being fired.\", \"I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that ren\\u00e9e zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock \\u00e0nd ren\\u00e9e zellweger. A strange mix of romance, violence and roadmovie. And for all a story that takes other directions every moment you think you're on the track. Many soap-opera-lovers will love 'nurse betty' - the movie as well as the character!!! - but they can bring all there non-soap friends, 'cause they will enjoy the story even more for the hard and humorous lines - freeman and rock - for the cruel scenes, the thriller-aspects and for the beautiful pictures. And I'm quite sure that at the end everyone will love 'nurse betty' for her captivating and innocent charm!!!\", \"Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I loathed Fargo on first viewing, then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.  Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain). Chris Rock was good but not a standout. Rene Z. is so natural it's unnerving -- i.e., unnerving to be \\\"natural\\\" playing someone not well in the head. Also liked the sort of \\\"abrasive sparkle\\\" performance from Allison Janney in a small part.  Don't go expecting as much of a \\\"road movie\\\" as you might assume from some synopses. (There is \\\"road,\\\" but it's only barely relevant.) Rated 8/10.\", \"I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera. Because of this, she goes on a journey to Los Angeles to reunite with her supposed soap opera character lover Dr. Rubell. To add fuel to the fire, she is also being chased by some ruthless `one life not to live' hitmen who think she has stolen their drugs. You could say that is how Nurse Betty spends `the days of her life' throughout the movie. This very `ungeneral' situation eventually leads her to the `hospital' set of her beloved soap opera. However, the only problem is that Betty thinks this is all real. It is like her mind is in `another world.' Ok! Enough! I will wipe off my mouth with soap and not mention any more soap names. I have already registered my vote for Renee as a best actress oscar nominee. Also, Greg Kinnear's performance as Dr. Rubell was as good as it gets in his acting biography. To sum it up, my final diagnosis is that everyone should call in for `Nurse Betty.' ***** Excellent\", \"Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor. He has the ability to perform those over-dramatic soap scenes with just the right facial expressions and voice intonations. His scenes with Betty seem like something out of \\\"Sleepless in Seattle\\\" or some other romantic comedy like that. You almost forget that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are searching Betty down. Morgan Freeman's fascination with Betty was rather creepy, considering that he could practically be her grandfather, but the scenes where he is conversing with her photograph are definitely worth a few laughs! Chris Rock's performance seems rather wooden, but he has his moments. Renee Zellweger is so sweet as Betty, the lovable waitress with the crude, unfaithful husband who treats her like dirt. It's very unlikely that she would have actually gotten a job at a hospital without any real credentials, but, hey, it's a movie, just go along with it! Her roommate, Rosa, shines as well, as a woman who cares about Betty, but doesn't quite know how to deal with Betty's sickness. And, lastly, there is Crispin Glover. As a fan of his, I, naturally, thought that the movie could have been funnier had he been in it more. No one else has the same style of acting that Crispin has, and the argument between Chris Rock, Crispin, and the sheriff about the soap opera is hilarious. I guess I'm saying that I liked this movie quite a bit! If you can stomach blood, violence, and a lot of foul language, it's worth the watch and will give you plenty of laughs!\", \"*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it,I laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the film.However I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say.The plot is very simple.Betty(Renee Zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her \\\"true love\\\" for a soap series character,Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film. And here comes the big question.What is the film all about? The reference to \\\"The Wizard of Oz\\\" is obvious.Betty and Dorothy are both from Kansas however while Dorothy come at the end of that film to the conclusion that \\\"there is no place like home\\\", Betty doesn't come to any conclusion and by the end of the film we are left wonder what has she learned from her experience and the answer is simply nothing.It seems not to affect her at all.  Than is the film about the different between reality and fantasy? could be,but the scenes that are dealing with this subject are short and serve no more than a joke and not as a serious plot line that can take the film to other places.(and by the way \\\"The Truman Show\\\" dealt with this subject in a much better way).  The film could be about obsession.Betty is obsessed with the soap series and Charlie(Morgan Freeman) is obsessed with Betty.LaBute show two sides of obsession and he seems to forget that obsession,in any form is dangerous,and should be condemned.He seems to have sympathy to Betty's obsession because he sees it as a harmless one.  All a long the film we have scenes that in itself could have been a subject for a whole film,but are left for us to think about without that they will have impact on the characters.  The ending is simply a make -up that has nothing to do with what we saw before.It's a shame because the film could have been sharper if he would have concentrate in one or two subjects.As it is,it's about a lot but actually say nothing.  What we are left with is the feeling that we have seen a little film,amusing and weird that could have been much much more.\", \"Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.  When soap opera obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show).  As the two oddly paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona. Renee Zellweger turns in an innocent, candy-coated, and sometimes terribly sweet performance as Nurse Betty. She exudes goodness, warmth, and is irresistible. While the script sometimes feels like a sit-com, is filled with sometimes unbelievable characters and contrived situations, Zellweger is so likeable and so utterly disarming that it all comes together.  With just a few splashes of black comedy to keep things interesting, a winning performance from Zellweger, a great supporting cast and a competent script, Nurse Betty is utterly delightful.  7 out of 10\", \"I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through. It has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.  If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see Rock isn't going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore. Hell, Kiss the Girls was watchable with him in it.  Renee Zellwegger does the best she can with her role, and Kinnear is good as her obession.  Sweet movie with a nice touch of gratuitous violence in it to satisfy the bloodlust of the male. 9 outa 10  \", \"If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as \\u0091nurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock.   The film bounces continuously between comedy, drama, romance, and thriller. Yet despite this apparent identity crisis, it holds up quite well. I found my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end always waiting for the next twist in the story. The entire cast is strong, if not spectacular.   My only real complaint is that director Neil Labute (who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and dark \\u0091In the Company of Men') relied much too heavily on many cliched Hollywood conventions. The mood-creating musical effects he crammed down our throats during each sentimental scene were unbearable! And he did the standard old \\\"let's take some of the minor characters and pair them up at the end in an illogical and unnecessary romance\\\" trick, just to make absolutely certain everyone goes home with a smile on their face. Why must directors and writers treat their audiences like idiots??  But the movie is still much too enjoyable to be dragged down very far by these annoying irritations. In a very subpar year for movies, 'Nurse Betty' ranks as one of the more pleasant surprises of 2000. 8 out of 10.\", \"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. The unbelievable story of A GUY who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. Gosh, is this what life made us be? People deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? \\\"Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore\\\".\", \"Renee Zellweger is a Kansas housewife whose domineering husband is mixed up in drug trafficking. Two professional hit men -- Morgan Freeman and his son, Chris Rock, murder the husband in his dining room. Zellweger, unobserved by the killers, witnesses this and undergoes a dissociative reaction, assuming the personality of a nurse -- the eponymous Betty -- who is a character in her favorite soap opera. Believing herself to be the TV character, Zellweger takes off in her husband's car, which has a load of dope in the trunk, and travels to LA where she hopes to link up with another character in this mindless afternoon drama, \\\"Dr. David Ravell\\\", Greg Kinnear. Not realizing she is being pursued by the two hit men, she drives to LA where she manages to link up with Kinnear and is actually written into the show as a nurse named Betty. A handful of men in the know, including the local sheriff, catch on to what's happening and also seek Zellweger in LA. The ending is believable and poignant.  If that sounds crazy, it's because it is. And it's the writer's responsibility, John C. Richards. The curious thing is that Richards and the director, Neil Labute, with considerable help from the performers, just about pull it all off. This isn't a plot that has been cast in a familiar mold. Nope. I give it bonus points for sheer originality. Somebody went out on a limb. Somebody took a chance on a movie that was NOT a copy or remake of something that had made money ten years or fifty years ago. I imagine the people involved, down on their knees every night, praying fervently. I don't know if the film was remunerative but it's mostly successful on its own aesthetic terms.  It's what might be called an \\\"initial premise\\\" movie. You start off with a single transformative event, in this case the murder of Zellweger's husband and her adoption of a genuinely new personality, and follow the resultant logical paths realistically. \\\"Groundhog Day\\\" is another, better and more intricately plotted, example. \\\"Nurse Betty\\\" has its logical cracks, where the incidents give up their plausibility. Eg., at a party in LA, Zellweger finally runs into Kinnear, the guy who plays her ex-fianc\\u00e9 on TV. She's stunned (because, after all, she thinks she's Betty, who lost her fianc\\u00e9 long ago). She approaches Kinnear and a couple of his colleagues and introduces herself as \\\"Nurse Betty\\\", the character. She addresses Kinnear by the name of his TV character, \\\"David Ravell.\\\" The group are puzzled at first, then convince themselves that she's an aspiring actress who insists on staying \\\"in character\\\" during the conversation -- and afterward, too, after Kinnear has become fascinated by her and the others bored. Kinnear drives her home and even when she kisses him goodnight, she's still in character, leaving Kinnear wide-eyed with astonishment at the relentless way she captures the character of Betty. On the next date, Kinnear returns her love. That development, the relationship between Zellweger and Kinnear at this point, is a crack in the logic, the kind that's absent from \\\"Groundhog Day.\\\" By the end of Night One, Kinnear, like any other person, would realize that Zellweger is a few clowns short of a circus.  The rest of the film, which includes many digressions, succeeds beyond expectations. The relationship between Morgan Freeman and his insolent, nihilistic son is marvelously spelled out. Morgan is flawless in his exasperation. He manages to fall in love with the image of Zellweger as he unearths clues to her whereabouts and activities, and at the end he can't bring himself to shoot her. She's too sweet to shoot. After her transformation into Betty, she left a note behind in Kansas. \\\"I want to help all life, whether it be animal, plant, or mineral.\\\" Who could harm the author of such a preposterous connative statement? His admiration of her comes as an epiphany, as he stands near one of the floodlights at the rim of the Grand Canyon. Zellweger, dressed as Dorothy, or maybe the Good Witch of the East -- well, characters that, like Zellweger, are from Kansas anyway -- appears to Freeman and he embraces her and kisses her tenderly. It's a scene that's at once eerie, romantic, and a little spooky. I once stood at one of those lights and threw some shredded paper into the updraft from the dark canyon and found myself surrounded by a thousand swirling bats who had misperceived the fluttering shreds as moths.  Right. Where was I? Okay. I was trying not to run out of space. Zellweger's performance deserves plaudits. Everything she does, every movement, every utterance, is naive and tentative. She really IS a likable character -- and that despite the fact that she's no glamor girl by Hollywood standards. But -- what an actress. Compare her performance as the bumptious 19th-century hick in \\\"Cold Mountain.\\\" Just the opposite. But then everyone is up to snuff in this enjoyable film. Allyson Jannings does a fine job in a minor role. Watch her when she tells Greg Kinnear that she's considering killing off his character in the soap opera in a drowning accident. Kinnear is one of those narcissists who wears the kind of ten-thousand dollar thin black leather jackets that were popular at the time. He chuckles and says, \\\"Oh, one of those castaway deals, right? Okay, how do I get back?\\\" Jannings doesn't answer. She just smiles at him with those enormous blue eyes and tilts her head mockingly.  Not a masterpiece of film-making but a good, original, professional job by everyone concerned.\", \"Minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.  Held together by a wonderful central performance from Ren\\u00e9e Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.  Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress Betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fianc\\u00e9 and sets off from Kansas to Hollywood to find him.  Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless. Crucially she's never really a victim despite this and while she undoubtedly suffers horribly the motives of the characters who treat her poorly are all understandable - even Greg Kinnear as the object of her deluded affections may be an egotistical, blinkered, arrogant pig but he genuinely believes that she's merely a quirky wannabe actress with bags of talent rather than an insane stalker.  The farcical ending where all the main protagonists descend on the same place (in this instance Betty's house) at the same time to have it out is as old as cinema itself but it works quite well here, even if the shift in tone is unfortunate.  Zellweger is ably supported by Kinnear and Morgan Freeman both doing solid work, and it's especially pleasing to see Chris Rock show restraint in his earlier scenes.  Not nearly as cruel as you might expect, and not at all mean-spirited, Nurse Betty - while far from being a laugh riot - is a solid entertainment elevated to something considerably more by the lead actress.\", \"Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while Betty secretly watches. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his RN ex-fianc\\u00e9e. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk. Pursuing her are Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock respectively), the hit men who inadvertently killed Del before they found out where the drugs were hidden. They pursue her across the country, while Charlie gradually falls in love with his image of her.  And in LA, things get totally bizarre, as no one realizes that Betty is delusional. Alternately funny and touching, this movie is almost perfect. Stop reading commentaries and go see it.\", \"Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) lives her life through soap Opera \\\"A Reason to Love\\\" as a way to escape her slob husband and dull life. After a shocking incident involving two hit men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), Betty goes into shock and travels to LA, believing that she is destined to marry the show's main character (Greg Kinnear).  Nurse Betty is that rare thing, a lesser known film with an all-star cast and a fluffy Rom-Com plot that surprises with it's terrific script and spot on acting. Indeed, such a plot makes one question the R rating, but it's warranted all right. The shocking incident that sends Betty over the edge is a tad too graphic compared to the light, amusing comedy that is to come and feels like something out of a different movie, but at the same time it is necessary to believably show Betty's transformation into the doe eyed, lovable nut job she becomes.  As we go along with Betty on her journey, director Neil LaBute works some extraordinary magic which makes the movie unique and high above your bog standard comedy of error. An example of this would be Betty's first meeting with her crush. She pours her heart out to him and he plays along, thinking she's auditioning for a part on the show. Even as we are aware of the ludicrous nature of Betty's ramblings, the music swells as she speaks, giving us, the audience, Betty's emotional perspective. We almost believe what she is saying, yet we understand that her mind is fractured. Whereas other filmmakers would try to accent the ridiculousness of the situation to wring every ounce of possible comedy out of the scene, LaBute is sensitive to his main character and treats her with the utmost sympathy and understanding.  The banter between the hit men played by Freeman and Rock is priceless, the excellent script doling out clever line after clever line for them to riff off of. Freeman in particular is excellent as always, pacing himself as his character slowly and blindly falls in love with his own ideal of Betty, not even truly knowing who she is or what has happened to her. Aaron Eckhart once again shows versatility in the thankless role of Betty's no-good husband and he is almost unrecognisable. The other revelation here is Kinnear, whose portrayal of the soap's star is not too overcooked. There's a tendency to lay on the celebrity bastard clich\\u00e9 as thickly as possible, and Kinnear resists, instead imbuing him with a pompous yet restrained self importance, despite simply being a soap star.  The soap opera is realised so well, it could almost exist. LaBute and co hit the nail on the head with this one and a good thing too. If the soap opera had been too satirical, a large part of the film would not have worked. To do a \\\"Days of Our Lives\\\" spoof as seen in Friends would have been the wrong move for this movie. The dedication to detail pays off, as the style and feel of the soap opera begins to bleed into Betty's reality more and more, while keeping with the overall unintentionally comedic aspect of the genre. The scenes on the set feel real, as opposed to some films in which the atmosphere feels so manufactured, you wondered why people who do it for a living can't get it right.  The neat resolution of the final act, while being a tad predictable, is wholly satisfying overall. It's a shame that after LaBute directed this wonderful film, the mainstream came calling for him to direct the abysmal remake of The Wicker Man, a fine example of a man so totally above the material given to him. Unfortunately, one cannot absolve him of all responsibility.  If you haven't seen Nurse Betty, it's something to discover. If you have, it's worth a re-visit. There is a charm to Nurse Betty that is infectious, even if it may not leave you thinking that much afterwards. A hidden gem nonetheless.\", \"As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for \\\"Dr. David Ravell\\\" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of \\\"A Reason to Love\\\", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles. Immune to reality, Betty arrives in L.A. and becomes \\\"Nurse Betty\\\" as she tries to belong in the hospital world of her dream lover. Meanwhile, the angered Charlie and Wesley track Betty down, convinced she is a dangerous witness who also knows about their compromising dealings with Del.  Nurse Betty creates comedy and suspense by contrasting its main character's extreme innocence and optimism with the evident hypocrisy and violence that surround her. By clearly defining the protagonist's difficult life, Nurse Betty justifies its character's tendency to turn away from reality. Thus, while offering a comment about the popularity of the soap opera within the film, Nurse Betty also makes a comment regarding the widespread addiction to television and its celebrities. In addition, Nurse Betty benefits from the effective manipulation of its protagonist's mental state, particularly in those scenes where she cannot distinguish between \\\"Dr. David Ravell\\\", the character, and George McCord (Greg Kinnear), the actor who plays him. Betty's incapacity to recognize George as an actor leads to funny misunderstandings, which stress the magnitude of her delusional state. However, in spite of these successes, Nurse Betty suffers from the troubling characterizations through which the narration evolves. For example, while Charlie and Wesley are consistently portrayed as a comical pair, the brutality of their actions undermines any sense of appreciation or acceptance the viewer might have initially experienced. Similarly, although the initial scenes establish Del as a detestable man, the humiliation and violence he experiences with his murderers surpass all the humiliation and violence he caused his wife Betty.  Finally, toward the end of the film, Charlie undergoes awkward transformations as he develops an obsession for Betty; an obsession which results in noble feelings of love, and which ultimately destroys him. Consequently, since the characters' roles as victims lack consistency, the story's victimization processes seem random and unsubstantial. All in all, Nurse Betty's indeterminacy --rather than creating suspense-- weakens its characters and pollutes its plot.  \", \"I'm not sure why I picked for a borrow from mom for \\\"Nurse Betty\\\". I think just because I had heard a little bit of this movie. But I'm glad I did. \\\"Nurse Betty\\\" is an original and clever movie that has humor and a darker side.   This was one of Renee's first big one's before hitting it major in Hollywood. I can see why, she is an incredible actress. The scene where she finally realizes what had happened and she's on the set of her favorite soap opera, you can see pain, confusion, fear, and embarrassment on her face. Just to let you in on the movie, she plays Betty. A shy and insecure woman who stands by her abusive husband, she's a waitress, and is in love with soap operas, especially one where a certain cute doctor, Dr. Dave Revell. When she happens to see her husband's murder accidentally in separate room, the murders she notices are two customers she just had, Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. She then just looses her mind and leaves town after talking to he police and says she needs to find her former fianc\\u00e9e, Dr. Dave Revell. So, she travels along the country to California to find Dr. Revell, and wants a job as a nurse to work with Dave, she's seen the show so many times, somehow she's just awesome at being a nurse when she saves a woman's brother. Despite everyone telling her that she is delusional, she just looks at them like as if they were the crazy one's. When she meets the actor who plays Dave Revell, George(his real name) thinks she's just a crazy fan trying to get on the show. She just looks at him with confusion and believes that he and her belong together.  Renee was terrific, she was so believable on loosing her mind in the movie. She has come such a long way, and wither you want to admit it or not, she's adorable and a great actress.  Morgan Freeman plays one of the assassin's, Charlie, who is the father of the two. He is so charmed and smittened by Betty and while chasing her around the country, he becomes almost just infatuated with Betty to the point where he almost falls in love with her. He and his son Wesley must find Betty when they find out she was there at the murder scene and could give away their identities. When Charlie sees Betty and catches her finally, she's scarred at first, but calms down and they know they have a real connection. It was a beautifully played scene, my opinion is that Morgan gave a stronger performance. He's just great.  A surprisingly decent performance by Chris Rock, the son, Wesley. He is so \\\"gun\\\"-ho about just getting the job done in a rush and taking care of business. I loved his comedic performance at the end where he and the gang he's holding hostage by gun point are just watching the soap opera's together. Classic. \\\"Nurse Betty\\\" is a great movie that I'd recommend for a good laugh and just in all a nice honest little movie I think anyone could enjoy.  9/10\", \"Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her.  What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Only problem: Dr. David isn't real, he's a soap opera character on the show `A Reason To Love' and he's really an egotistical actor named George McCord.  To say any more regarding what develops would be too much, but Nurse Betty is certainly original. Its hit men are, like the hired killers of Pulp Fiction, are violent yet philosophical, its take on soap operas terrific spoof material, and its acting is the best feature of all. This has to be one of the best cast films in recent years. Renee Zellwegger is perfect for Nurse Betty, with the constant gleam in her eye that pushes her in her quest. Morgan Freeman brings his constant state of grace to the role of a killer at the end of his career, and Chris Rock is his partner, a man of rage and great impatience. Greg Kinnear is at his comic best as the vain actor/soap opera doctor. There are also great supporting performances from actors such as Emmy-winner Allison Janney (The West Wing), Harriet Sansom Harris (Frasier's agent Bebe Glazer), and Kathleen Wilhoite (Chloe on ER). Actually, the supporting cast is a Who's Who of television best character actors.  A unique film that is funny one moment and chilling the next, Nurse Betty is a mix of great acting, casting, and a terrific screenplay.\", \"Nurse Betty is really an interesting movie. I guess we all know someone who is so convinced that the characters in a soap opera are real, that you can't explain them with any means that these are just actors and not real persons.  'Nurse Betty' isn't a nurse at all. In real life she is an ordinary housewife who works at a diner. To escape from her awful husband and the problems in her miserable life, she has become a very dedicated fan of a soap opera. After she witnessed her husband being murdered, she goes into some kind of a shock and she loses all grip on reality. She thinks she's in love with one of the characters from the soap opera, a doctor, and decides that she'll visit him and start a family with him. The hit men however think that she knows too much and go after her to kill her.  As I already said, the subject is quite recognizable (if you leave the professional hit men and the murder out of it) and the movie was funny. The story was well directed and the actors did a fine job. It had everything I always want to see when watching a comedy. I give it a 7.5/10.\", \"With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing. Nurse Betty is one of the darkest comedies to be advertised towards a mainstream audience in years, and considering its moderate box office and critical success, perhaps moviegoers weren't as dumb and brainwashed as we though they were. The story follows (both figuratively AND literally) a naive waitress (Zellweger) who has fallen in love from afar with a handsome soap star (As Good As It Gets's Greg Kinnear) but is trapped in a loveless marriage to a slimy car dealer (Aaron Eckhart, who made his big-screen debut in Company). When her husband is gruesomely murdered by two hitmen (Freeman and Rock), she's sent into shock and obliviously sets out for Hollywood to meet her object of affection -- unaware that he's only an actor. When Freeman and Rock discover that the car she took contains 10 kilos of cocaine, they hit the road as well and outrageousness ensues. Fans of LaBute's previous work might have a hard time figuring out how this could possibly be the same guy who directed In the Company of Men -- a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist pigs who play a practical joke on a deaf co-worker --, but when you think about it, the connection is rather clear: in Company, a vulnerable woman is unaware that she is being ruthlessly taken advantage of. In Betty, a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man she's chasing thinks her genuine adoration is nothing more than a joke. Some might begin to wonder if LaBute is really some sort of misogynist himself -- considering that his recurring theme involves the downfall of innocent women. But personally, I think he's coming to the defense of the fair sex and dealing far more harshly with the abusers in his pictures than the abused. One of the many charms of this film is that it's absurdity is full-fledged: most directors, when handling a script such as this one, would leave the story at two hitmen chasing a woman chasing a dream. But LaBute knows better, and has one of the hitmen (Freeman) fall obsessively for Betty as well. This was an interesting role for Freeman to take, because it allowed him to play off of his trademark `this-is-the-last-time' character (see Unforgiven, Se7en, and 1998's stinker Hard Rain); the supporting cast also includes the likes of famed weirdo Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Allison Janney, and `Mad About You's Kathleen Wilhoite. The script, written by first-timers John C. Richards and James Flamberg, is deliriously over-the-top (honestly: have you ever seen a comedy -- or ANY movie, for that matter -- in which a man is scalped in his own dining room?). You could argue that the ending is a little too perfect, but it's really not worth denying everything that's great about the film for one trivial complaint. If Nurse Betty is any sign of what LaBute has in store for us next, you can bet that I'll be lining up for whatever he decides to follow it up with.  Grade: A-\", \"To sum this movie up, it is LaBute carrying his sadism over into the realm of comedic farce. The predictable result is that he is constantly stepping on all the jokes by insisting on surrounding them with blood-curdling violence and extremely hateful characters. There is also evidence of his continuing efforts to insult and ridicule everything in sight but then to apologize for it with weak gestures to the PC. Basically the movie just doesn't work, its plot is beyond contrived, the characters are one-dimensional cliches, there is no consistency or development of anything, and the comedy (where it is not totally out of place) is the worst kind of High Concept drivel.  Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger are completely wasted on characters that seem like parodies of studio-driven audience pandering--no matter what, make them likeable, neutral (and neutered), and full of moral platitudes. Crispin Glover is in here just long enough to convince you that he doesn't belong in movies anymore. Chris Rock actually has negative chemistry with fellow hitman Freeman--it's as if they are acting in different rooms even when they are two inches away from each other. In effect, Chris Rock seems like a digital insert. At least he isn't as annoying as Jar-Jar.  LaBute's 15 minutes may well be up by now. It's already looking like he's overstayed his welcome.\", \"Renee Zellweger is radiant, but the rest of this movie just does not work. It's like a hamburger-jello-mold salad--interesting idea, but who ever thought it would actually work on film? I like director LaBute's two previous films--they were mercilessly honest and chillingly funny. This film manages only to be merciless and chilling--with jumbo dollops of the cutes. (As high concept, think: the Doris Day-Rock Hudson movie Sam Peckinpah might have made--now reduce your expectations to match the present, mass-produced state of Hollywood.) That actors as talented as Freeman, Kinnear, Eckhart, Vince, and Janney ALMOST make their scenes come alive is a testament to the immensity of their talents to rise above material that just does not cohere. I would have found Freeman's corny, feel-good-about-yourself speech at the end of the movie funny (in a Lynchean way) if it weren't for the nagging suspicion that this unconvincingly tacked-on moral is meant to be accepted seriously.\", \"Okay, this movie starts out and it *looks* like it's going to be a cute comedy about a completely obsessed soap opera fan. She has no touch with reality whatsoever outside of the soap (sort of the inverse of the main characters in \\\"Pleasantville\\\") and runs away to Los Angeles to meet a fictional character. Well it is a cute movie... but at the same time, it is ALSO a dark, very violent movie about two hitmen who are out to kill Betty for reasons way to complex to recount here. Either plotline would have been enough on it's own, but \\\"Nurse Betty\\\" contains both stories at once, and the effect is very jarring. I didn't much enjoy it.\", \"I was pretty enthusiastic about seeing this movie when it came out. Commercials for it made it look quirky and I generally like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea. Sadly, I was terribly disappointed with Nurse Betty.  Personally, I've usually found that graphic violence and comedy don't go all that well together, and the only directors that have ever combined the two successfully, in my opinion, are Tarantino and the Coens. There isn't that much violence in Nurse Betty, but what violence is in it made me feel kind of weird when I was supposed to laugh. Of course, for me, part of the problem was also that there didn't seem to be many places where I was being asked to.  The film doesn't much work as a drama, either. Renee Zellweger's Betty, the story's protagonist, is clinically insane and impossible to relate to in any real way. I will say Zellweger acts the role quite well, and Freeman, Rock, and Greg Kinnear all do good jobs too. The problem is in the writing; Freeman is the only person that gets to play an interesting character. It's really too bad. 3/10\", \"A wildly uneven film where the major problem is the uneasy mix of comedy and thriller. To me, the unusual premise is clearly a comedic one, and they should have gone for an all-out comedy. For example, Rock has some funny lines but occasionally he is too unlikable for a comedy. The scene where Betty's husband gets scalped is too nasty for what should have been a less violent comedy. An even better example is the Hollywood leftist writer preaching to us tritely through Freeman's character, early on, about the plight of the Indians; I mean - yawn! They should have given Freeman something funny to say in that segment, but that is of course much more difficult than to simply write him a boring PC speech.  There is yet more New Age PC-ness in the form of the ending: the girl not only doesn't get the boy - she gets no boy at all; in fact, the message is that the girl needs no boy at all! Bit of a feminist statement there. The first half-hour is weak, but the movie gets better - ironically - once Zellweger gets to Kinnear. I say \\\"ironically\\\" because I'm not much of a fan of Kinnear's, though he's solid here. Zellweger is very cute, as usual; she has the sort of all-American cute looks which should appeal to almost every guy, and I have to wonder why more of such women aren't \\\"represented\\\" nowadays, instead of the dogs who inexplicably became stars, such as Diaz, Roberts, Aniston, Lopez, or Barrymore.  Since the movie tries to be very serious at times, I have no choice but to criticize Freeman's character which is the gangster's equivalent of the movie world's hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold. There is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between Freeman and Rock to suggest even remotely that they were father and son.\"], \"review_score\": [10, 10, 8, 9, 9, 9, 7, 10, 8, 9, 8, 7, 7, 9, 8, 7, 7, 7, 10, 8, 7, 9, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4], \"review_category\": [\"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 7.3}, \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0190590\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"An Officer and a Gentleman\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0084434\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Panic Room\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0258000\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Panther\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0114084\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Patriot\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0187393\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Pet Sematary\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0098084\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 30, \"review_content\": [\"when i saw the movie at first i thought that it was boring because nothing was happening but when all the scary things started to happen like when church dies and is brought back to life and also gage and his mom die and there idiot dad has to bring them back to life even though he nows the warnings and ignores Jud.this is not Steven kings best work. i thought that his best work was the shining. i don't think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking. as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick. i mean making the gage evil and how he kills Jud is genius. making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool. people who didn't like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all. don't expect something from a movie that it isn't. it still in a general area wasn't that good. i still recommend people to watch the movie\", \"There is something about Pet Sematary that I never felt anywhere else.

Overall I give this movies a 7 out of 10 for its good parts (relative accuracy and overall making sense) and for its bad parts (large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies).\", \"Personally, I absolutely love this movie and novel(I read the book first and decided to see the movie). First of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind. The acting is also great and i love the cast. Judd Crandall (plays Fred Gwynne) fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you. There are also a few corny lines thrown in there (Idk if they were meant to be corny), but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh. The Maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie. Not only will you love it but you'll want to see it again and again, I recommend this 100% to any horror fan!!\", \"Ah, clich\\u00e9s, clich\\u00e9s, clich\\u00e9s; They're a main part of a wide variety of horror films.This one, has a lot of them.Still, it's Stephen King, one of the best masters of horror. This movie was really good, just TOO predictable. And what horror movie doesn't have stupid people? This one is overcrowded with retarded victims just practically begging for their life to be taken. Pet Semetary I found to be creepy a little. The way everything is set up was REALLY spooky, but not terrifying. For the most part, the acting was SOMEWHAT believable, the suspense wasn't that suspenseful, but the entertainment level is set at a major rank; My eyes were practically glued to the screen.All Stephen King fans must see this movie, but as for anyone else, expect an OKAY thriller.\", \"Probably the most accurate Stephen King adaption yet. Not surprising, since King himself wrote the screenplay. The story follows the Creed family moving into a beautiful Maine house. One of the other residents is Jud, a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area. One is the highway that runs right through their frontyard. The other is a path leading to the Pet Sematary, where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway. Soon enough, Ellie Creed's cat, Church, is found dead. Luckily, this happens while the family, with the exception of Louis(the father), is away for Thanksgiving. Jud takes Louis to another burial ground, beyond the Pet Sematary, where Church is to be buried. Later, Louis is greeted(not so politely) by Church. He's returned, appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in. Maybe he was buried alive. Maybe not. Nothing more I can say without ruining the story.  Of all the King adaptions I've seen this would be the most terrifying. The characters are real and the situations are normal. Mary Lambert does a great job directing the proceedings. Suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film, due in part to the plot development. The scene where Gage is killed will stick in your mind forever. Then, of course, we have the conclusion. Easy to determine what's going to happen, but Lambert pulls off some genuinely scary, and sometimes disturbing, moments.  Overall, this is a good film and an excellent adaption. If you enjoy being scared and don't mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then \\\"Pet Sematary\\\" is just what you're looking for. Non Horror fans will want to avoid this.\", \"So often with Stephen King adaptations, you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from the books. This really captures the heart of the book. Maybe because they DON'T use large chunks of text straight from the book, but it's a bit more of an improv of the events in the story. A big part of its success is Miko Hughes as baby Gage. Dale Midkiff and Denise \\\"Tasha Yar\\\" Crosby really act like his parents. There's a scene where Louis is cuddling Gage, and they are very natural together. Fred Gwynne is WONDERFUL. He nails the Maine accent perfectly without lapsing into parody, and is wise and warm just like Jud should be. (8 out of 10)\", \"Ok, first I have to point the fact that when I first saw this flick I was 9 years old. If I had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time, I\\u00b4d probably have noted that this is just another cheaply-made-cable-TV horror film with some well-made scenes. But when you\\u00b4re nine you just don\\u00b4t care about those facts. This scared the hell out of me back then, especially those aforementioned Zelda- scenes (and they still do). Nowadays I\\u00b4m kind of hooked to this film. I have to see this maybe once in a month, and on every new year\\u00b4s eve I watch this with a 12-pack of beer & bunch of friends. It\\u00b4s like an appetizer for a good party! I kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense. Midkiff and Crosby do look like I wanted Louis and Rachel look like, but one can\\u00b4t see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two. Hughes and Gwynne pretty much save the scenes which \\\"the Creeds\\\" underact. What I actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to Pet Sematary, and I don\\u00b4t mean the zombie stuff here. THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS CERTAINLY A NOVELTY AND ONE OF A KIND. Honestly, how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable-TV one, but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror-chillers out there? Alright I busted some of the cast\\u00b4s balls a minute ago, but I have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection. But hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to Pet Sematary! I really would love to know...And I don\\u00b4t mean night of the living dead here...this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff.\", \"*****Spoilers herein*****  What really scares you? Killer sharks, or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message? Maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath?  Maybe. But those fears don't even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider--and that is the death of one's own child. \\\"Pet Sematary\\\" taps this base, primal adult fear, and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore.  I've read comments about this film that include poor acting, characters making stupid decisions, etc. I disagree. The acting is actually first rate for a film like this. Maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario. But the film's events are not only logical, they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible. This is the true horror of \\\"Pet Sematary\\\": It isn't that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels, it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that Louis Creed does. Despite warning, or even past history.  The movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart. The heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect. And the results are horrifying. In fact, when the film dives into slasher territory near the end, it's almost a letdown, although I believe it's perfectly logical how it got there.  I am a true horror fan, and I contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made. If you don't think so, see it again after you have children.\", \"MINOR SPOILER  Underrated little Stephen King shocker. It's not perfect, by any stretch of the imagination--even if the limp performances of Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby were better, there'd still be the mismanaged mystical story elements to contend with. The old Micmac burial ground, Rachel's terminally ill sister, and the Jacob-Marley-an Victor Pascow never really come together into anything coherent, and the film in places feels confused and overstuffed. But few horror movies really are perfect, and what this one may lack in other areas it makes up for in its willingness to shock. `Pet Sematary' may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory, with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive portrayal of Zelda. It's politically incorrect, it's tasteless, it's gratuitous--and yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way `safer' horror movies never can. Add to that one of Fred Gwynne's best performances and Mary Lambert's witty direction, and you have an intensely satisfying scary movie--even with the hokey ending. Highly recommended for genre fans. 7.5 out of 10.\", \"\\\"Pet Sematary\\\" succeeds on two major situations. First, it's a scary Horror movie. Those that just aren't produced in these days. Second, it's an emotional, clever movie overall. So if you are looking for chills, scares, creepiness and visually stunning settings, great acting, dialongs, and gruesome effects; this is the movie you are looking for. A classic now and truly a must see for any Horror fan.   Probably, the best adaptation to any of King's novels. The events feel a little rushed compared with the novel, but that doesn't means that this underrated movie isn't a complete Horror/Drama accomplishment.   Stephen King's novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time. The movie captures the same feeling mainly because there's a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it's members. Then, when everything seems to be happiness (technically happy, because the title \\\"Pet Sematary\\\" does not offers appiness!) a tragic event changes the movie's atmosphere, now it turns very dark. The movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits, but after Gage is killed the movie becomes sad, gray, creepy. Dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family's entire life, and \\\"Pet Sematary\\\" proves it dramatically.   The legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience, but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot. Sadly enough, the legend comes true and baby Gage returns from the dead. The previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it's something much, much worse. What will happened with the lives of our All American family? Could Pascow prevent this tragedy? What is it with the surreal nightmares?   Watch \\\"Pet Sematary\\\" to witness one of the most touching, emotional Horror movies of recent times. You won't regret. The acting is very good although I didn't dig the actor who portrayed the father. He didn't seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation. But that's just my opinion. Denise Crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble, tender mother. Baby Gage was amazing even on his creepy parts. *Shivers*. Overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people's deepest fears... the loss of someone you love, the dead returning to life, and a feeling of desperation.  Something is for sure... I don't wanna be buried, in a pet sematary!!\", \"Making a book into a movie by following the story page-by-page is NEVER a good idea. When people read the book, they automatically start making their own \\\"mental movie\\\" of who the characters look like, the places they exist in, how the situations progress. And everybody's mind's-eye opus is different, which is why when the 'REAL' movie finally comes out, you're always going to have a ticked-off segment of the movie-going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn't measure up.  All a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is, and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see.  There is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of Stephen King. When filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories, the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying (CARRIE, 'SALEM'S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE), or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd-awful mess (Kubrick's version of THE SHINING; the miniseries for IT and THE TOMMYKNOCKERS).   Although it's not even close to being the perfect King adaptation, PET SEMATARY has so many moments of just skin-and-bone-deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book, that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings. For that, we have music video-turned-film director Mary Lambert to thank, (she also directed SIESTA, not exactly a horror movie, but another freaky-as-hell must-see you should put on your list), working from a screenplay by the 'Man-ster' Himself, and probably one of his better ones.  Since the majority of you know the story, I won't put you to sleep with too many of the details. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country. Well, almost perfect, except for two nasty little details: the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front, and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back. Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son...well, even if you haven't read the book, do the frickin' math. It IS a King story, after all, so no mystery where this is headed.   It's not so much the destination that counts here, but the spooky stops along the way. Certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery, scream-inducing life here: Rachel Creed's (STAR TREK'S Denise Crosby) horrific memory of her terminally ill, crippled sister; Louis's encounters with the mortally injured jogger Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist), both before and after his death; the trip into the \\\"other\\\" cemetery beyond the pet cemetery. And that third act...if it doesn't give you a few nightmares, maybe you should check your pulse.  Good performances by all here, especially the late Fred Gwynne as the well-intentioned neighbor, Jud Crandall, who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up: \\\"Sometimes, dead is better.\\\"  About the only problem with the movie version is the casting of Louis's son, Gage (Miko Hughes). Knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this, Lambert and crew still did the best they could, and unfortunately, Hughes at the time was just too damn CUTE to \\\"sell\\\" his intended role as an evil, demon-possessed zombie. This takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up, though the scenes where he's featured are still masterfully staged, (especially Gwynne's death scene.)  Other than that, everything else is still about as good as it gets. CARRIE still holds the title for best King adaptation as far as I'm concerned; but SEMATARY is right up there in the Top Five.  Still, will anything adapted for the screen based on a King book be as terrifying as reading the story? Not BLOODY likely...for now.\", \"This is one of the creepiest, scariest and most heartbreaking horror movie EVER!   Dr Creed (Louise) and his family moving in to new home with his wife (Rachel), Daughter (Ellie) and little son (Gage) Everything seems normal until Dr Creed loses one his patient who had a terrible head injury,Then he is haunted by the ghost know as Victor takes him to the Pet Sematarty and show him that where the dead come to life.  Louis not knowing if that was all dream and is talking to Ellie who worried about her cat that could be killed by lorry and then later on Rachel tells Louis that it really hard for to talk about death because of her sister Zelda who was really sick (As we see in a flashback how sick her sister really was and this is one of the most creepiest scene ever!)   The next day Louis gets a call from Jed saying there cat as been killed by lorry and Jed take him to place where Victor the Ghost told him not to go! And bury the Cat, His wife and kids have go to see their Grandparents and Louise is home alone shocked to see the cat is back and now it as evil in it eyes so he goes to see Jed then Jed tell him that he also buried his dog there too (As we seen other flashback).  Later on in the movie The Family out having Picnic, Gage is playing with kite and Gage say's I drop it\\\", The wind blow the rod near the road where a lorry coming at fast past, Gage is get closer to road, Louis is rushing to get him, The most HEARTBREAKING scene in any horror movie will leave with your Jaw on floor or Shivers will go down your back when you hear Louis screams, Soon he missing him so much, Louis then buries Gage in same place where is buried the Cat.   The scariest thing about this movie is that some scenes in this movie are not too far from really life.   This movie is just Amazing and the acting from everyone was great! 10 out 10\", \"I am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on Stephen King's books - this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable.  I have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and I still find it heart-wrenching as well as scary.  The scene where Gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out. And the \\\"No fair\\\" uttered by little Miko Hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance.  \", \"\\\"Pet Sematary\\\" is an adaptation from the Stephen King novel of the same title. The story follows the Creeds - an all American, middle-class family, who move into a house out in the country. The family consists of Louis and Rachel, and their two young children, Ellie and their toddler son, Gage. The house couldn't be better, and the family meets a strange but friendly old man, Jud, who lives across the road. He leads them down an old path into the woods one day where a pet graveyard lies - filled with a huge amount of animal graves. And just beyond there, lies a sacred Indian burial ground that seems to possess a strange power. When the family cat, Church, is killed, Louis sees it fit to bury him in the pet cemetery - and strangely enough, soon after, Church returns to life. But there's something evil about him now, he isn't the same cat he used to be. And when a tragic accident takes the life of young Gage, Louis decides to apply the same concept in hopes of reviving his dead son... unfortunately, he gets more than he bargained for.  Having read Stephen King's novel, I can say that the book is much better than the film. Not to say the movie is bad, because it isn't - the book is just a little bit better. The real strength in this film lies in it's story, which is both bizarre but extremely original, something that King's stories are typically known for. The script is very well adapted from the story, and while it minorly differs in some aspects, it's a pretty good page-to-screen transformation. There are a few plot holes here and there, nothing major though. Besides that, this movie is actually pretty scary, and it succeeds in it's intention to do so. There are some really disturbing scenes throughout the film, and I'd have to say that the flashback sequence of Rachel's sister Zelda is the number one. Honestly, that is one of the most disgusting, disturbing things I've ever seen in a horror film - it's not gory and bloody, it's just flat out sickening. One thing's for sure, that image won't leave your head anytime soon.  The performances in this film were all very up to par and I really had no problem there. This film is actually on the gory side, there are plenty of nasty little sequences to please all of the gore hounds out there, including the shocker of an ending. I really liked the way they ended the film, it was abrupt and somewhat inconclusive, but it worked better that way with all things considered.  Overall, \\\"Pet Sematary\\\" is a good horror movie that I'd recommend to those who are fans of either Stephen King or just fans of the genre in general. The story is the film's greatest asset and it's a creepy one too. One of the better Stephen King adaptations I'd say. 7/10.\", \"Louis Creed, a doctor from Chicago, moves to a large house near a small town, since he is going to be giving classes in the University of Maine's. Along with him, is his wife Rachel and their two kids, Ellie and Gage,as well as Ellie's cat, Church. Soon, they met their new neighbor,and old man named Judd Crandall.Judd not only warns Louis and Rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their house(that is constantly a way used by big trucks) but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house. Judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery, but Rachel is against to talk about death and spirituality with her children, since she has traumas from her sister Zelda's death.  During the first week of the family in the new house, Louis already has dead people to deal with: Victor Pascow, a student who has been fatally injured in an automobile accident, addresses his dying words to Louis personally, even though the two men are strangers. On the night following Pascow's death, Louis experiences what he believes is a very vivid dream in which he meets Pascow, who leads him to the pet cemetery and warns Louis to not \\\"go beyond, no matter how much you feel you need to.\\\" Louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was only a dream, until he discovers his feet and the bedsheets covered with dirt and pine needles. Anyway, he dismisses the dream. Many strange things starts to happen and Church, Ellie's cat, dies while walking on the highway. Louis stays worried in how he is going to talk about Church's death with Ellie, but Judd, sympathizing with him, Jud takes Louis to the pet cemetery, supposedly to bury Church. But instead of stopping there, Jud leads Louis farther on a frightening journey to \\\"the real cemetery\\\": an ancient burial ground that was once used by the Micmac ('...Indians...'). There Louis buries the cat on Jud's instruction, with Jud saying that animals buried there have come back to life. And that is where the real horror story begins...  I personally find this movie very good. It's not THE most horrifying of all, but it is one of the best horror movies I watched. The way Gage dies, is almost impossible to not stay in your memory, specially being a toddler. It's cool to see Stephen King's cameo as the minister of the funeral.  Of course, there are some script errors: How can a rich doctor with two small kids, goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house? How Gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck? Why Louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters? Things like that doesn't make any sense, but I can understand that all horror's scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work.  A good thing I saw in this movie, is the necessity to talk about death with the children, no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist, and also that avoiding important subjects doesn't help anything. Because of Louis being afraid to be honest with Ellie, confronting her and saying that her cat wouldn't be back again, all the nightmare began.\", \"As this happens to be one of most favorite novels , I was very excited to see the move. I was not disappointed! Yes of course there are a few things that I could pick on , but I think that the movie stuck true to the book, and was a really good movie. It seems that Stephen King films mostly get a bad review , but this is one of the good ones. It is such a dark story , which I guess is why I like it .. and what is better than the dead coming to life.. and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too. If you have seen the movie do yourself a huge favor and now read the book!! It is a well written screen play , the actors could have done a better job ( I only say this for Rachel , and Ellie .. she was so whinny ) I liked everyone else a lot.. and most important to me .. it stuck true with the novel.\", \"In the trivia section for Pet Sematary, it mentions that George Romero (director of two Stephen King stories, Creepshow and The Dark Half) was set to direct and then pulled out. One wonders what he would've brought to the film, as the director Mary Lambert, while not really a bad director, doesn't really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of King's novel, of which he wrote the screenplay. There are of course some very effective, grotesquely surreal scenes (mainly involving the sister Zelda, likely more of a creep-out for kids if they see the film), and the casting in some of the roles is dead-perfect. But something feels missing at times, some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably King-like atmosphere, which is in this case about as morbid as you're going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in (who knows if he'll save that for his final novel...)   As mentioned though, some of the casting is terrific, notably Miko Hughes as Gage Creed, the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80's horror movie, to being a little monster (I say that as a compliment, of course, especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel). And there is also a juicy supporting role for Fred Gwynne of the Munsters, who plays this old, secretive man with the right notes of under-playing and doom in tone. And applause goes to whomever did the make-up on Andrew Hubatsek. But there are some other flaws though in the other casting; Dale Midkiff is good, not great, as the conflicted, disturbed father figure Creed, and his daughter Ellie is played by an actress that just didn't work for me at all.  In terms of setting up some chilling set-pieces, only a couple really stand-out: a certain plot-thickening moment (not to spoil, it does involve a cool Ramones song), and the first visit to the pet sematary (the bigger one), including the sort of mystical overtones King had in the Shining. For the most part it's a very polished directing job, though it could've been made even darker to correspond with the script. If thought out in logical terms (albeit in King terms) it is really one of his more effective works of the period. But it doesn't add up like it could, or should. Still, it makes for a nifty little midnight movie.\", \"Pet Semetary (1989) 9/10 The Creed family have just moved into the small town of Ludlow. The family consists of a father, Louis, a mother, Rachel, a brother Gage, and a daughter, Ellen. They are greeted with kindness by Jud Crandall. Jud is 89, and could basically tell you about the entire history of Ludlow.  Behind the Creed's new house, there is a path leading to a pet cemetery (spelled pet sematary). When Ellen wants to go up to see it, Jud willfully takes the family on a trip. That is the start of hell for the Creed family.  When Rachel and the kids are gone, Ellen's cat Church dies. Jud feels that Ellen isn't ready for the death of her cat, so he suggests Louis follow him further up the path, past the pet cemetery.  Jud tells Louis of this burial ground, once used by Micmac Indians. Louis buries Church, without Jud's help. A couple of days later, Church returns, alive, but from hell.  This movie was one of two horror movies that could actually scare me, aside from \\\"The Exorcist.\\\" The greatest performance would ever be Zelda, Rachel's sister with spinal meningitis, or Victor Pascow, a ghost who tries to help the Creeds from making the mistake of bringing back things from the dead.  The music in this movie plays an extravagant part. It is at the same time sad and mysterious. It goes along with the movie wonderfully.  9/10\", \"I am a big fan of Stephen King's work, and this film has made me an even greater fan of King. Pet Sematary is about the Creed family. They have just moved into a new house, and they seem happy. But there is a pet cemetery behind their house. The Creed's new neighbor Jud (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery. That burial ground is pure evil. Jud tells Louis Creed that when you bury a human being (or any kind of pet) up in the burial ground, they would come back to life. The only problem, is that when they come back, they are NOT the same person, they're evil. Soon after Jud explains everything about the Pet Sematary, everything starts to go to hell. I wont explain anymore because I don't want to give away some of the main parts in the film. The acting that Pet Sematary had was pretty good, but needed a little bit of work. The story was one of the main parts of this movie, mainly because it was so original and gripping. This film features lots of make-up effects that make the movie way more eerie, and frightening. One of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back, was in fact the make-up effects. There is one character in this film that is truly freaky. That character is \\\"Zelda.\\\" This particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise. Zelda is Rachel Creed's sister who passed away years before, but Rachel is still haunted by her. The first time Zelda appears in the movie isn't generally scary because she isn't talking or anything, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time scares the living **** out of me. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it is almost perfect. Pet Sematary delivers great scares, some pretty good acting, first rate plot, and mesmerizing make-up. This is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time. 10 out of 10.\", \"Pet Sematary is a very good horror film and believe it or not somebody can make a good horror film out of a Stephen King novel. Mary Lambert does a great job with this film and manages to bring across King's creepy story pretty well. Most people may avoid this, but they should check it out.\", \"One of the best (if not the best) Stephen King's screenings.

The father (Dale Midkiff) then finds out about the Micmac burial ground beyond the pet cemetery that has powers of resurrection - only of course anything buried there comes back not quite RIGHT.  Below average \\\"horror\\\" picture starts out clumsy, insulting, and inept, and continues that way for a while, with the absolute worst element being Midkiff's worthless performance. It gets a little better toward the end, with genuinely disturbing finale. In point of fact, the whole movie is really disturbing, which is why I can't completely dismiss it - at least it has SOMETHING to make it memorable. Decent supporting performances by Fred Gwynne, as the wise old aged neighbor, and Brad Greenquist, as the disfigured spirit Victor Pascow are not enough to really redeem film.  King has his usual cameo as the minister.  Followed by a sequel also directed by Mary Lambert (is it any wonder that she's had no mainstream film work since?).  4/10\", \"\\\"Indian burial ground\\\": If those three words appear anywhere in a real-estate listing, look for a different neighborhood. A young couple with a young daughter and a toddler-age son move into a Maine house adjacent to a pet cemetery--and, after a l-o-o-o-ng hike, an ancient Indian burial ground. Seems the Indian ground can bring Fido or Fluffy back from the dead--if you don't mind having a raving hell beast for a pet. It can do the same for dead people--if you don't mind having a homicidal zombie around the house.  Throw in a busy two-lane blacktop, speeding big rigs, a well-meaning (if somewhat dim) old neighbor, and one kid who really doesn't get enough supervision, and I think you can figure out what happens from there--an over-the-top, illogical mess, which, in all fairness, does offer up a few scares.  Well, there are worse Stephen King adaptations (such as \\\"Maximum Overdrive,\\\" which King also directed). But there are far better ones, too (such as \\\"Salem's Lot,\\\" \\\"The Dead Zone,\\\" and both versions of \\\"The Shining\\\").\", \"Fot the most part, this movie feels like a \\\"made-for-TV\\\" effort. The direction is ham-fisted, the acting (with the exception of Fred Gwynne) is overwrought and soapy. Denise Crosby, particularly, delivers her lines like she's cold reading them off a cue card. Only one thing makes this film worth watching, and that is once Gage comes back from the \\\"Semetary.\\\" There is something disturbing about watching a small child murder someone, and this movie might be more than some can handle just for that reason. It is absolutely bone-chilling. This film only does one thing right, but it knocks that one thing right out of the park. Worth seeing just for the last 10 minutes or so.\", \"Pet Sematary , though a nice 80's Horror movie, with a nice Director and atmosphere, IS a copy of the Italian movie ZEDER by Pupi Avati. It's clear that Stephen King has copied almost all the ideas from this director (the movie Zeder was made before King wrote the book)  The cat, the ground, everything was copied, this is a case of plagiary , but, being Stephen Kind a famous American writer , it's totally normal that he can get away with this , it's obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of Italians movies with no -budget (and in part, it's crap itself ... ) but the original idea, I repeat it, it's Italian director Avati  Let the world know\", \"Stephen King is generally known for the morbid, and that's fine, but this story is too morbid. Some movies, by the end you feel sad for the characters or the situations they were put through...here you just feel depressed. The movie has a nice feel to it (at first), with the family moving to the country, and creepy old Fred Gwyne greeting and warning them of the pet cemetery, but this plot leads nowhere. It starts with so much potential, but by the end, it loses the potential to be a good horror movie, and becomes corny, extremely stupid, and ultimately depressing.  Louis (Dale Midkoff), his wife Rachel (Denise Crosby), their kids Ellie and Gage, and their cat move to a new home in Maine. They are warned by the loony farmer neighbor Jud (Fred Gwyne) about the local pet cemetery and how it is cursed. Louis thinks nothing of this and everything's fine until the family cat is killed. He bury's it in the cursed cemetery and it comes back to life, constantly hissing at the family and wanting to be left alone. One day, infant Gage runs out in the road and is run over and killed by a truck, and Louis knows he must bury him in the cemetery. When Gage comes back to life, he is changed and wants to murder.  With many of Stephen King's works that don't translate well into films, I blame the directors and screenwriters. In this case, Mr. King was the screenwriter, but I'm going to blame him for his awful story. By the end it's so pointless, and though unfunny, the premise is laughable. A little boy comes back from the dead and manages to kill people with what looks like a tiny scalpel, and not only that, but he manages to lift their bodies and in one case, carry a body from the ground to the attic!(?) I know this isn't set in reality but seriously, how stupid can this get? The scene where Louis injects his deceased, now living again cat to kill it is strangely sad, because the cat did not deserve this. All it did was go around minding it's own business and he killed it. The scene where he injects his own infant son is almost unbearable. Not unbearably sad, but the whole situation is just awful to think of. After being injected Gage staggers drunkenly around before falling down dead....why did they need to make a movie ending with the death of an infant? But...even worse, the actual ending of them film involving Louis burying someone else (Not going to give away who) in the cemetery after Gage kills them....what did he expect? Why did Mr. King write this horrible story and why was it made into a movie? It's depressing and pointless!  My rating: * out of ****. 90 mins. R for violence.\", \"Now, I haven't read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here, so I'm not going to go down that path here.  But I have some time ago learnt that Stephen King movies simply -are not- horror films, with perhaps a couple of exceptions. This was not one of them. It started well enough, and for once I'm not going to complain about the acting, although Fred Gwynne was as usual wonderful.. Also I will forgive the total lack of parenting skills, as they were necessary to make the story here move forward...  But there was one consistent point that I couldn't help but get annoyed with. And that came pretty close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters partook in the activity of dumb stupidity. The moments I refer to are thus: There is a tiny zombie running around the house. You suspect it is under the bed. Do you   (a) get as close to the bed as you can before blindly raising the duvet cover up, exposing pretty much your whole body to whatever damage such a teeny undead cannibal might inflict on you, or   (b) move a little away from the bed so you can peer under the completely open end from a position of slightly increased safety, or at least see the mini terror coming at you, giving you a little reaction time.  I know, let's go with (a). I feel like offering myself up for the slaughter today. Bleh  Fun enough film though... Just not very scary.\", \"A family with dad Louis (Dale Midkiff), mom Rachel (Denise Crosby), 10 year old Eileen (Blaze Berdalh and about 3 year old Gage (Miko Hughes) move to this beautiful house in Maine--seemingly unaware of the semis that roar down the highway in front of their house every 90 seconds or so! The neighbor across the way (the wonderful Fred Gwynne) makes them feel at home...and shows them a pet cemetery where children bury their pets. But a little further on is a sacred ground which can bring the dead back to life...but the dead come back in a nasty mood.  \\\"\\\"DEFINITE SPOILERS** The novel by Stephen King was good--it was long but it developed characters and situations that made you care what happened. This movie jettisons ALL the character development and just plays up the gore and violence. Animals are killed ON camera (I know it's faked but it's still repulsive); a little boy is hit by a semi and his casket pops open during the funeral (in a totally sick scene); he's brought back to life and attacks and kills people including his mom (I DO wonder how a 3 year old was able to hang her); a ghostly jogger (don't ask) tries to help the family for no reason...The movie just works the audience over shoving every gruesome death or violence into your face. It just goes out of its way to shock you. **END SPOILERS**  Acting is no help. Midkiff is just dreadful as the father--he's handsome and buff but totally blank. Crosby isn't much better. The two kids are just annoying. Only Gwynne single-handedly saves this picture with his effortless good acting.   This picture shows a total contempt for the audience taking large leaps in logic and having characters do incredibly stupid things (especially Midkiff at the end). This movie was (inexplicably) a huge box office hit in 1989 which led to the even worse sequel in 1992. I saw it in a theatre back then and was disturbed how the audience kept cheering on the violence and was just appalled by what I saw. A sick repulsive horror film. A 1 all the way.

Same, I'm going through puberty humor jokes, just  dumber and grosser. This movie is really a disgrace to movie goers. They  try to shock you into laughing because you can't believe the levels they  have to stoop to make you laugh. So my offer above stands as\", \"After coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes. Though i guess not. If the first one wasn't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch. With all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever. Though they couldn't, they had to take all the same raunchy, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again. Though the thing is i didn't laugh at it the first time. They tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level. Most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes, that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to watch it and enjoy it. Then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene. Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience, well i fit into the age range that it's supposed to be funny for. While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you do find this funny then you probably aren't one of the more mature or intelligent people around. It doesn't take that much skill to write that kind of a script, though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie Spaceballs. It's a movie parody that's actually good and well done and it didn't have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either.\", \"Given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its shortness (81 minutes - including end credits, so roughly 76 minutes of actual film). But what it cannot explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed.  The gags are quick and sometimes not even funny. The only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the Nike basketball spots, James Woods' portrayal of Max Van Sydow's character in the Exorcist, and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film. Very unfunny was the take off of Charlie's Angels, which like the first Scary Movie and the Matrix spin off scene, basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it.  Today's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70's such as the Exorcist and maybe of the 80s' Poltergeist, et. al.  Hopefully Scary Movie 3 will take some time to put together, making the spoofs more enjoyable.  One thing though, the film features more than the last one of promising young actress Anna Faris (whom I will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel). Just for her casting and acting ability, I give this movie a \\\"3\\\" out of \\\"10\\\".\", \"The script for \\\"Scary Movie 2\\\" just wasn't ready to go. This is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident, to the actors and the audience alike. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans, and many of the actors are funny people; and so the movie isn't completely humorless. To their credit, the film has several funny moments. But as a whole, \\\"Scary Movie 2\\\" is not even close to being as clever and amusing as the original.  The first \\\"Scary Movie\\\" was a laugh a minute film. It turned the smallest subtleties of the slasher film genre into comedic gold. The humor in \\\"Scary Movie 2\\\" is as heavy handed as it is un-original. They even miss obvious opportunities for parody. Two of the movies stars are former cast members of \\\"Beverly Hills 90210,\\\" and this was a show that was begging to be parodied! In the final analysis, \\\"Scary Movie 2\\\" is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened far too soon. The script needed a lot more time to age. 2 stars out of 5.\", \"The first one was different and funny. This attempt should have never left the studio. This movie does not make you laugh. It is a weak attempt at gross out humor. The movie picks out current and old movies to rip-off. This time the jokes seem used and overdone. The audience that I saw it with only re-acted to Hannibal dinner scene and was otherwise asleep.\", \"I know a few things that are worst. A few. It had a couple of funny scenes. It is a movie not appropriate for kids but, only a child would find this movie hilarious. This is definetly a movie that you would like to use a free rental coupon for. Don't waste your money just to laugh a couple of times.\", \"I was very disappointed by this movie. I thought that \\\"Scary Movie\\\" although not a great movie was very good and funny. \\\"Scary Movie 2\\\" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and at times plain stupid.  The Exorcist/Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great.  Now, I'll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first, where I had basically seen them all. But bad comedy is still bad comedy.  Something that really hurt this movie was the timing, which ruined some of what might have been good jokes. Scenes and jokes drag out way to long.  Also, the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again. For example, the talking bird. Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying. The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless.  Some jokes even got repeated from the first movie. For example, the 'creaming' I guess you would call it of Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in \\\"Scary Movie\\\" because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long, that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he 'creamed' her. But this time around it was out of place and not funny.  The bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around. The scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film.  Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie.  But I did enjoy Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film. The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film.  Don't get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their humor. That is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes.\", \"Scary Movie 2 was a grave disappointment. Simply referencing movies, like Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to comedy. The movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods ands Andy Richter. The movie plummets from there unfortunately. The acting is awful. Tori Spelling looks and acts completely out of place. The movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced. Some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie, involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie, werent funny to anyone in my theater. The movie, thankfully, comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending. (I say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor) I dont know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make Miramax some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers. Overall, a very poorly done movie.\", \"\\\"Scary Movie 2\\\" is a let down to the Scary Movie Franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny. Luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great Scary Movies.  This film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night. Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape.  This movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things. It is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise then give this a watch - but I don't think you will like it nearly as much.\", \"Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films, for there is not much of a plot , bad acting, pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes. But. And this is a big but, there is one good actor, one good recurring joke, and a good beginning. The good actor being Tim Curry, the one good recurring joke is the creepy,weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does cringey but laugh worthy things. And the good beginning is the spoof of the Excorsist.  The plot to Scary Movie 2 is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion, but will they survive the night? This film is not very good but if your bored you might as well watch it!\", \"I *loved* the original Scary Movie. I'm a huge fan of parody- it is my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor. The Wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film, then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel. I think the Wayans' are a family of comical geniuses. Alas, even geniuses make mistakes.  The movie begins with promise. I liked \\\"The Exorcist\\\" parody, especially the \\\"come on out, ma\\\" gag. Now, that's Wayans-quality material. But, other than that, I can only think of two other times I laughed: 1) when Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit, then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him. Meanwhile, he's saying, \\\"It was just a booty call!!\\\" That was kinda funny. 2) The \\\"Save the Last Dance\\\" parody where the Cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves. But even the short-lived giggles are no match for the side-splitting laughs of the first Scary Movie.  The rest of the movie is pure trash, filled with cheap gross-out gags. Jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone. For example, in Scary Movie I, several innuendos are made to imply that the character Ray is gay. This was hilarious. But, in Scary Movie II, the whole penis-strangulation scene with Ray under the bed was mind-numbing and incredibly unfunny. This is the pattern of the whole film. Shock humor *alone* doesn't take a movie very far. This was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately.   As much as it pains me to rate a Wayans movie so low, I have to give this one a 2 out of 10.\"], \"review_score\": [1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 4, 2], \"review_category\": [\"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 2.6363636363636362}, \"Serial Mom\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0111127\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"SERIAL MOM, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy which will leave a big smile across your face.

If you want to know why, you'll have to see the movie. I really didn't like Dottie (Mink Stole) and Mrs. Jenson (Patsy Grady Abrams). However, when Beverly made those crank calls to Dottie, I laughed absolutely hysterically. When I saw an extreme close-up of the Sterner's (Doug Roberts and Kathy Fannon) mouths as they ate their dinner, I was absolutely disgusted.

Unlike Waters' earlier films, which were meant for a niche audience (i.e., weird people--and I don't mean that derogatorily). So if you are looking for the ultra-low budget over-the-top films starring Divine, you may be disappointed that this film has a lot more polish and higher production values. However, this is NOT to say that SERIAL MOM is normal--just a lot more normal than these earlier flicks. Plus, this is one of the few Waters films you can watch with your kids--provided they are older and not terribly impressionable!  Kathleen Turner turns in her best performance as a combination between June Cleaver and Ted Bundy--complete with the pearl necklace. This movie, start to finish, is very funny and a great satiric look at life in the suburbs. In addition, like his later CECIL B. DEMENTED, it's an interesting satire that is a way over the top look at America's fascination with celebrity and how we admire and are fascinated with anyone if they are famous--even the vile and horrific.  NOTE--Like many of John Waters' later films, this one features a cameo by Patty Hearst.\", \"I`ve just seen this movie and would like to say its fantastic.

After wimpy Cry Baby and feelgood Hairspray he gives us a movie about a housewife (brilliantly played by Kathleen Turner) so eager to protect her children, her marriage and the wildlife that she is forced to harass and kill neighbours, ex-boyfriends and schoolteachers. Never before has John Waters given his characters so much room in an environment so nice and cosy. I loved this movie. And don\\u00b4t miss what's under the spandex pants at the concert with the group Camel Lips.\", \"Serial Mom was witty funny and extremely exciting and suspenseful, along with being thoroughly entertaining. I expected to enjoy the film for many different reasons.; But after the opening 15 minutes of the film and breakfast seen. I knew this would end up being a film of high quality and laughter. The camera styles of the breakfast scenario made the scene go beyond capturing the reality millions of families experience in real time. just excellent.  I found Kathleen Turner portraying the innocent, harmless killer, perfectly. The character came to life and seemed real. One of the best scenes thought, even I have to admit, was the very end scenario and expressions given between Kathleen Turner and Susan Summers for the closing scene which included Patricia Hearst; which only goes to show that even the most elegant and ravishing can not escape from bad fashion critics. Also Looking forward to seeing Patricia Hearst in longer more involved roles. A natural getting polished and learning to fly.  I know I will receive many hours of pleasure from this film for I will see it again.  D.A.T.\", \"SERIAL MOM.

Only a film like this can combine so many great elements into one entertaining movie.  Kathleen Turner is just purely brilliant as sweet mother Beverly Sutphin, who would look more at home in a show like Bewitched. However, we soon learn that she's not all that she seems. I love any movie that takes a classic element (in this case the innocent housewife) and completely turns it on its head.  And so the film leads us on a journey through Beverly Sutphin's life and motivations. The film grabs on, and doesn't let go, keeping the pace until the very last scene.  In bad taste? Well, yes. Sick humor? Quite often. Good? Oh yes. If you have a dark sense of humor, don't miss it for the world.\", \"John Waters meets mainstream and the resulta are spectacular! This was Waters' first real studio film-- 13million budget and it really took us where we wanted to go.

He's a sort of campy, joyful and irreverent filmmaker. He's not too much of a serious artist -- at least not from what I can tell here -- but he's a heck of an entertainer. He is, well, a master of schlock. He's nowhere near as creative as the Coen brothers and not as uproariously funny as the Farrelly brothers, but we're almost in a state of awe watching the movie, smiling, but wondering if we should be when an overly-sweet, caring mother beats a woman to death with a leg of lamb. Thing is, it never seems bad -- it's not even morally reprehensible the way Waters shows it. It's like when you've just watched a gag in extremely poor taste done pleasantly with such giddy amusement that you just shake your head and say, \\\"That is just wrong!\\\"  Kathleen Turner plays the mother who, underneath her thin veil of perfect mother normalcy, has a latent desire to murder those who offend her sensibilities. Sam Waterston plays her husband, a good-natured dentist who stands by his wife as long as he can. It's an interesting pairing of Sam Waterston and Kathleen Turner, two actors blessed with raspy, gasping voices. Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard play the two's children. Lake, the daughter in search of a boyfriend, is the first to suspect her mother's dark side and Lillard, the son with a love for classic gore horror movies, is interested when he's told his mother may be a killer.  It's sort of like a David Lynch movie, if you were to focus only on the \\\"gee whiz\\\" part of America and replace all of Lynch's darkness with campy situations, like a punk rock band called Camel Lips.  A lot of the dialogue and the satirical jabs were pretty obvious, but I wasn't quite sure whether this was just unsubtle comedy or if the joke was in how obvious some of the stuff was (\\\"I made a killing!).  The acting by Turner reminded me of Annette Bening's in \\\"American Beauty,\\\" but demented instead of one-note. All the leads are fine, but the big chuckles come from the supporting players like Mink Stole as poor Dottie Hinkle, the victim of a crank caller. Or Patricia Hearst, as a juror who's not in tune with what Turner sees as a fashion faux pas.  I had a big smile plastered on my face for about the first half-hour, which is the best part of the movie, and while the last half-hour loses some steam, it's still a joy to watch Turner and especially Mink Stole. It's not really a criticism, though -- most movies start with a great premise and have trouble resolving it. It's not so much that there's no satisfying resolution, it's that some of the more shocking moments come in the beginning and middle of the film.  The best way I can think to describe the movie is that it exists in a realistic place populated by unrealistic characters. It's a satirical, farcical black comedy that, despite its gruesome murders, is perpetually cheery and without a trace of mean-spiritedness. (Any modern movie that still uses wipes for editing...) With no pun intended (well, maybe some), it's a movie definition of \\\"queer.\\\"  I think I'll have to go look for \\\"Cry-Baby\\\" and \\\"Hairspray\\\" now. And if I can find it (and be able to stomach it), I probably owe it to myself to see \\\"Pink Flamingos,\\\" which may help me understand the \\\"filth\\\" label Waters is often given. This movie isn't filthy or vile; I had a good time and it's a nice break to see a movie as demented as this and not feel as if you were just subjected to watching a director stomp on someone already on the ground.  ***\", \"Ever have that day when someone gets on your nerves and you feel like pulling the axe on them?That's exactly what John Waters demonstates in his dark comedy Serial Mom.After starring in the cheesy family movie \\\"House of Cards\\\", Kathleen Turner has created one of the best performances in her life as the beautiful, heroic, misunderstood, law-obeying serial killer Beverly Sutphin.Eversince six murders, she has been placed with some \\\"terribly untrue charges\\\" and the only 'serial' she knows \\\"anything about is Rice Krispies!\\\".But she has good reason for butchering six people: they all commited a crime that no one understands, like dumping her daughter, eating poultry (because Beverly loves birds),smart-alacing about her dentist husband, refusing to rewind a rental tape, critisizing about her family skills, and witnessing one of the other five crimes.You may think she's insane, but really, she's just expressing things we'd rather hide inside of us.Like, say you work in a store and someone wants to return something but they don't have the recipt.It can't be returned without the recipt, so you tell them \\\"No can do\\\".Then they start cursing you out like you're worthless.Wouldn't you get the urge to shove a bullet in their brain?Well then, you now know how Beverly Sutphin feels when someone decides to be a wise guy.This movie is perfect for anyone who loves to laugh.Plus, the DVD contains the theatrical trailer, a behind-the-scenes featurette, several TV spots, four interview clips, and extra behind the scenes footage.I give this one a 10/10!\", \"Serial Mom is an absolute gem of a movie. Turner's acting is truly excellant, as is the whole casts. Although a little ridiculous at first, any flaws it has are made up for in the way Beverley carries out her murders, my favourite being the guy in the toilets gruesome demise.\", \"I really enjoyed this movie because Kathleen Turner and John Waters just let loose with the demented psychotic energy of a parent who takes many legitimate parental urges to the next level - or maybe the next 5 levels. She is protective, proactive, and supportive where her family is concerned, just a bit more so than is good for her or the rest of the world. The movie is funny and Turner is superb. The various strategems she uses to distract witnesses at her trial are delivered with the precision of a knife and she does more acting in the defendant's chair than most actors manage in a typical Hollywood flick today. I gave it a 7 rather than something higher because the action around her is okay but delivered more as a set-up for her various exercises in family values, and the plot itself doesn't seem driven by anything other than her proclivities for a particular problem solving approach. But it is a very entertaining film, though I wouldn't watch it with a kid under the age of 15, however jaded by the media today's youths may seem to be.\", \"This is one crazy house wife that you don't want to be a rude kid or adult because she will find you and hunt you down till you are dead.Man this was the best movie that I have seen that is based on true events that is horror that I know and love.This b****Y mom was finally on the louse and insane to kill people that are rude,dressed badly,and anyone that messes with her family,any jokes.And when she went to court was really when she became wild and made each eyewitness into trouble.She is using facts about them and her body to make them crack.And very funny when the judge was flirting with Suzanne Somers when she came in the Court.And lastly,great ending when she kill a woman for wearing   white after Labor Day.And that jury woman taught she was innocent right from the beginning,can you believe this damn woman.And she kills when she was just set free and kill,very stupid thing to do and stupider was the jury setting her free.Now she will continue her work,make a part two Mr. Waters.\", \"Serial Mom is another mainstream film in a way like Polyester (Considering both take place in suburban homes). Unlike the mom in Polyester who becomes an alcoholic, the mom in this film becomes a psychopath. Beverly Sutphin at first seems like the perfect mom. She has a great husband, Eugene, who's an orthodontist. Her son, Chip, is a horror fanatic. Her daughter, Misty, loves boy. Despite her perfect motherly image, Beverly has a dark side. Beverly secretly starts a series on phone harassments and vulgar letter to fellow neighbor Dottie just because she stole her parking space. She soon becomes a murderer after Chip's teacher criticizes about the way she raises Chip. They she does it is by running him over with her car. Soon, 2 nosy detectives try to find evidence that Beverly murderer Chip's teacher. Eventually, Beverly continues murdering people who get on her nerves. She uses fire pokers, scissors, air conditioners, and so on and so forth. Now the cops are prepared to arrest her and after that happens, she will appear in court and manipulate people into declaring her innocent. Despite being a mainstream film by John, Serial Mom shares a lot in common with Female Trouble. Both films have the leading lady committing crimes (Mostly murder), getting famous for it, and a classic courtroom. Another 10 out of 10!\", \"Black comedy can be a difficult genre to get right, in the cinema as well as in the theatre. We can, I am sure, all think of films which were intended to be gross but hilarious and ended up as simply gross. There are too many examples to list them all, but high on my personal list of offenders in this regard must be \\\"The Sweetest Thing\\\", \\\"Beautiful Creatures\\\" and \\\"Drop Dead Gorgeous\\\". On the other hand, when black comedy succeeds, the result can be superb. Two of my favourites are Kubrick's \\\"Dr Strangelove\\\" and Scorsese's \\\"King of Comedy\\\", both of which derive humour from serious subjects (nuclear war and crime) but do so with a brilliant satirical wit.  John Waters's \\\"Serial Mom\\\" is not quite in the same class as those two films, but is one of the better black comedies of recent years. The main character is Beverley Sutphin, a middle-aged, middle-class Middle American housewife. Beverley, happily married to dentist Eugene with two teenage children, Chip and Misty, lives in an affluent, idyllic suburb which looks as though it has been taken from a fifties sit-com. (Like most of Waters's films, this one is set in his home town of Baltimore). There is only one thing which disturbs the peace and tranquillity of the area. Beverley combines her role as a housewife and mother with a part-time career as a serial killer. Her first victim is Paul Stubbins, a teacher who makes some unkind remarks about her son at a PTA meeting, and she progresses to her daughter's unfaithful boyfriend, a couple who are rude about Eugene's dental practice and various people who commit minor social gaffes such as failing to rewind rented video tapes (the film predates the coming of DVD), failing to recycle their garbage, and wearing white shoes after Labor day. (This last is, apparently, regarded as a major fashion crime in America). Eventually she is arrested and put on trial.  Waters has the reputation of being a director to whom the notion of good taste is quite alien, and, with a plot like this, \\\"Serial Mom\\\" could have ended up as nothing more than horribly tasteless garbage. It is, of course, horribly tasteless and not a film to see if you are at all squeamish- Waters does not spare us sight of plenty of blood and gore- but is saved from ending up as garbage by two things. The first is an often very witty script, displaying a refreshingly cynical sense of humour, which includes some great lines such as \\\"He killed people, mom- We all have our bad days\\\". and \\\"Jesus said nothing to condemn capital punishment as he hung on the cross, did he\\\"? (the local priest is preaching a pro-death penalty sermon).  The second is Kathleen Turner's manically over-the-top performance as Beverley, alternating between a model of bourgeois domestic virtue and a bloodthirsty maniac, and playing both with equal relish. My favourite parts were the courtroom scene where Beverley conducts her own defence with great brilliance and the scenes where she makes obscene phone calls to her neighbour Dottie, a woman who can be shocked by a phrase as seemingly innocuous as \\\"Are those pussy willows?\\\" Turner is an actress who has somewhat disappeared from view in recent years, but in the eighties and nineties she was one of Hollywood's best known leading ladies and gave some excellent performances in films like the neo-noir thriller \\\"Body Heat\\\" and \\\"The War of the Roses\\\", another very good black comedy.  Like most good black comedies, \\\"Serial Mom\\\" has some serious points to make. The mores of suburbia have been fair game for satirists ever since the first suburbs were built, and here Waters is sending up the culture of middle-class conformity which all too often attaches to such places. Beverley is far from being the only all-American soccer mom who looks with horrified disfavour on her neighbours' minor deviations from accepted norms; all that distinguishes her from millions of others is the extreme lengths to which she will go to punish such deviations. The satire, however, is not just aimed at Beverley, but also at her victims, some of whom are such obnoxious individuals that it is impossible to have any sympathy for them, despite their horrific fates. There is one grotesque scene where Emma Lou Jensen (she who fails to rewind her videos) sings loudly and tunelessly along to \\\"Tomorrow\\\" from the musical \\\"Annie\\\" while allowing her dog to lick her feet all over suggesting she is, to say the least, a somewhat strange person. Stubbins, who suggests that Chip is in need of \\\"therapy\\\" because of his love of horror films, is the sort of arrogant, self-important teacher who thinks that he is paid not just to teach maths but also to control every aspect of his students' lives, down to their taste in films.  \\\"Serial Mom\\\" may not be the best cinematic satire on suburbia of recent years (that must be Sam Mendes's \\\"American Beauty\\\"), but it is, for all its lapses of taste, a witty and entertaining black comedy. 8/10\", \"Even after 15 years, this movie is still pretty much amazing, even though it's surely not as half as shocking as it was before. The story is fickle. You have one perfect family, on top of which a Stepford mom resides, like a queen bee. She hates swearing, bugs, and don't even think of chewing a piece of gum in her kitchen; if there's one thing she hates the most, is somebody messing with her family. She's perfect: she's the Brie Van Der Kamp of the 90s. And one might think, that she takes her parental duties a little bit too seriously. Is she? The basic core of the movie is for a viewer to confess: didn't you ever want to kill your neighbor? Of course, one might say, but I'd never do it. Didn't you ever want to kill that bitch from across the street? She's never been nice. Of course, but I'd never do it. The victims of Beverly Suthpin aren't nice people: they're fake, they're nasty, they're everything that's wrong with the world. In some people's eyes, they should be eliminated. And that's where the true genius of the movie emerges: the silly comedy has an actual moral discussion going on under the layers of ridiculous rage and gore. Waters is a genius: he knows exactly how to play with all of the ingredients of his movies. He places words in right situations as it was a breeze; he puts some black humor when it gets too serious and just a little bit of scare and creepiness when it gets too kitschy. He's always one step ahead of the viewer: he knows his stuff. Or maybe he doesn't care and just goes with his guts? Either way,\", \"This film won't be to everyone's liking, but is certainly an all-time favorite of mine. Only a film like this can combine so many great elements into one entertaining movie.  Kathleen Turner is just purely brilliant as sweet mother Beverly Sutphin, who would look more at home in a show like Bewitched. However, we soon learn that she's not all that she seems. I love any movie that takes a classic element (in this case the innocent housewife) and completely turns it on its head.  And so the film leads us on a journey through Beverly Sutphin's life and motivations. The film grabs on, and doesn't let go, keeping the pace until the very last scene.  In bad taste? Well, yes. Sick humor? Quite often. Good? Oh yes. If you have a dark sense of humor, don't miss it for the world.\", \"I'm not a John Waters fan by any means but i thought this movie was a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Kathleen Turner plays serial murderess Beverly Sutphin who on the outside is a loving mother but upset her family in any way and she will kill you. Kathleen Turner was great in war of the roses but in this movie she was simply majestic.The way she combined her light side with her dark side was inspired. Some parts of the movie might make you turn your away in disgust and after the dentist scene I will see to it that I never have to go to the dentists again However some parts of the film are absolutely hysterical and during the masturbation scene I had to stop myself having a serious accident i was laughing so hard. Sam Waterston was superb as Beverlys husband and Matthew Lillard and Rikki Lake did a fine job as her children but this was Kathleen Turner's film from start to finish and i cant remember any film in which she has been better The way she manipulates the judge and jury at the end of the film is clever and really ,really funny.By the end you are actually hoping she will get away with it, This film is a masterpiece and deserves only the perfect score 10/10\", \"I am a hardcore John Waters fan, but this is not my favorite film of his. I can't really think of anything I would want to change about it, however, other than maybe setting it in the 50's or 60's so Van Smith could have worked his costume magic. I personally consider this film and Pecker to be his weakest. However, even my least favorite Waters film beats most movies. If another director, say Robert Zemeckis or someone had directed this, then based on the subject matter, I probably wouldn't have had any interest in seeing it. But hey, any movie containing the credits \\\"Written and Directed by John Waters\\\" (in this case, the credit is superimposed over an image of a pulverized fly who has just been swatted by the title character...he always picks the best shots for his credit, doesn't he?) well, I'm there, no matter what the premise is. Waters' films often center on 'troubled' but lovable female characters, and this one is no exception. Kathleen Turner does a great job portraying Beverly Sutphin, a June Cleaver-esque, devoted happy homemaker who doesn't even allow gum in her house, but has a short fuse and keeps a secret scrapbook (I wonder if it was from Waters personal collection) of clippings about serial killers. We don't know how long she's been killing, but the first half of the film follows a week in her life and the various neighbors and acquaintances she dispatches simply because they pi$$ her off. Ever momentarily had an urge to kill someone when they stole a parking spot from you, badmouthed a member of your family, or committed an obvious fashion violation? We don't act on it (well, *I* don't anyway, maybe some of you have and I just don't know about it) but Serial Mom sure does.  Again, only Waters could have pulled this movie and subject matter off. If you're a Waters devotee, then you are well aware that criminal behavior, trials, and serial killers are subjects near and dear to his heart-this is a man who is a self-confessed \\\"trial groupie\\\". With any other filmmaker, it could have been boring. Many probably would have been extremely offended by a movie about a lovable serial killer played for laughs (especially those who knew the victim of a violent crime) but the tone of the movie is so light and over-the-top that only people with no sense of humor could think it might condone murder. Who else but Waters could think of a victim being bludgeoned to death with a slab of pork chop (because she made the mistake of not rewinding a movie before she returns it to the video store) while watching a videotape of \\\"Annie\\\"? This is not the funniest Waters movie I've seen, but it has its moments. Among the funniest are the scenes where Beverly torments her neighbor Mink Stole with hilariously obscene phone calls to drive her over the edge. Also very amusing are scenes where Beverly's whitebread manner (\\\"oh honey, the only \\\"serial\\\" I know anything about is Rice Krispies!\\\") contrasts with the horrified stares of her family and neighbors. Turner is best in the moments when she goes from a harmless Donna Reed to Charles Manson within seconds when someone makes the mistake of annoying her- just watch her face. Waters fans should also watch for cameos /small roles by Alan Wendel, Traci Lords, Susan Lowe, Mary Vivian Pearce (I only recognized her from her distinctive voice) and though he doesn't appear in the credits, Waters manages to work in Don Knotts.  This is one of the few Waters films that I rent from time to time rather than own, but it's still lots of fun. I'll take one of Waters less memorable films over a teen slasher flick or anything starring Jean-Claude Van Damme any day of the week.\", \"The above is just one of MANY great lines offered up by the cast of 'Serial Mom'.....  The Sutphins seem to be the picture of a normal 50's-esque family - dad (Sam Waterston) is a dentist; mom (a FANTASTIC Kathleen Turner) is a grand house wife homage to Donna Reed, June Cleaver and such; daughter (Rikki Lake) and son (Matthey Lillard) seem to be your average teens with a perfect family life.... Or is it?  Based upon actual real life events, John Waters manages to bring us another great film - and this time - he takes dead aim on the 'celebrity' we make of murderers and criminals....  I'm sure that many of us have gone through our lives, being annoyed by this person or that object and we've never done anything about it.... Not Betty Sutphin.... When this suburban mom goes off - she goes off.... From minor annoyances (white shoes after labor day!) to major anger management issues, Betty takes matters into her own hands - by going on a killing spree - taking 6 victims to an early grave....  Sure, in typical Waters way, it's a bit over the top and corny, but the film is great! Some of the humor is very low brow - in bad taste, but, as Waters mentions in interviews - bad taste can be good taste!  I gave this a 9 - a greatly enjoyable film!\", \"Imagine this: the main character is a woman called Beverly Sutphin. Her husband is a dentist and she does her best to bring up her children. In short, she is a respectable human being with the particularity of being a real stickler for good manners . Maybe, a little too respectable so that when someone speaks ill of one member of her family, Beverly is ready to kill to defend her family!  Only one filmmaker seemed designated to shot this highly entertaining black comedy: John Waters, the king of bad taste and extravagance. In \\\"Serial Mom\\\", most of the comical situations are structured about the two quoted characteristics. The whole is condensed in one hour and a half. You don't get bored one moment and you honestly laugh in front of all these murders. In \\\"Serial Mom\\\", you also recognize Waters' strong taste for bloody, gore and horror movies. Moreover, for this extraordinary director, it is the occasion to harm the model image of the American family.  All in all, a delightfully politically incorrect comedy led by a Kathleen Turner on top form.\", \"I saw Serial Mom for the first time as a fairly young kid, and thought it was pretty good. I've just seen it for the first time as an adult, and it turns out that I'd forgotten just how good this film really is! It's certainly not to everyone's taste, and if you can't handle high camp, you definitely don't want to see this; but if you like your films wild and wicked, Serial Mom is a treat indeed! The film follows a slasher plot line, but it's clear that director John Waters didn't want to merely make a slash flick. The film is a parody of life as a housewife, the media and modern society in general; with a heavy dosage of sick humour and a very unique mean streak running throughout. Serial Mom is the sort of film that puts a smile on your face, and it follows the story of a not quite so normal American mother. While her fellow housewives are cooking dinner and cleaning the house, Beverly R. Sutphin is out dispatching people that have got on hers and her family's nerves in a variety of nasty, yet hilarious, ways. Her kids think it's cool, and her husband is duly worried...  Kathleen Turner takes the lead role, and does an excellent job of performing in a serious, yet jokey way; which does the film no end of favours on the parody front. She looks the part, acts the part...and really, I cant think of a better middle-aged actress to take the lead in this film. The support cast, which includes Matthew Lillard and Ricki Lake, is good; but it's the director that's the real star of the show. John Waters has made a name for himself by creating odd and twisted films, and although I haven't seen a great deal of them; Serial Mom is his best as far as I'm concerned. It's one of those films that constantly make you laugh (providing you've got a sick sense of humour), while poking fun at society and offending all the right people all at once! I love originality in movies, and this really is one unique film. The nineties saw the release of lots of obscure social commentaries that were lost under films like Schindler's List and Fight Club, and Serial Mom, along with Francois Ozon's 'Sitcom', is one of the best 'under the radar' films of the decade. It's not a film that everyone will like, but everyone should see it just in case!\", \"  An uproariously witty satire on \\\"petty\\\" bourgeois American values, John Waters brings his own distinctive madness to the screen by focussing on cardboard cut-out caricatures of pop culture Americana.  Turning his outrageous gaze on an archetypally perfect housewife and mother from the Baltimore suburbs in Maryland, supportive to her loving husband and teenage kids and possessing a real tlent for cooking, it appears that she is everything a stable, hard-working business man could want. However, there is a slight catch. She is also a serial killer.  Mom's tendency to take bloody revenge on any poor neighbouring housewife who fails to observe her rigid socially acceptable guidelines, like not recycling rubbish or driving too fast, is so barmy you are sure to find it absurdly and darkly funny. Kathleen Turner, alternating between dizzy, unquestioning devotion to her family and clinically cool, yet psychotic anger to offending neighbours, either appears to possess a martyr's yellow halo above her head, denoting divine lightness and freshness, or a focussed smile as she carefully contemplates her next victim.  If you are on the lookout for some perfectly vibrant, yet malicious black comedy, subscribe to \\\"Serial Mom\\\", one of the most ruthless, patronising skits on good manners and nosey, voyeuristic neighbours ever to hit the screen. If you like Waters' latest irreverent venture into visceral, cutting black humour, then get all his other movies, because they are all even more extreme and grotesque - \\\"Pink Flamingos\\\", \\\"Hairspray\\\", \\\"Cry Baby\\\" - all kitschy, underrated classics in their own right.\", \"Just last year, Roger Ebert sang the praises of the serial killer B-movie Kalifornia, citing it -- and vastly overestimating it -- as a brilliant character study with something intelligent to say about our culture of violence. While that film took itself way too seriously, Serial Mom manages to get Kalifornia's attempted message across by a far more successful means: humor. It is a John Waters film in the purest sense, in that it's entirely IMpure. More edgy than his last movie, Cry-Baby, but not nearly as extreme as Pink Flamingos, Serial Mom is filled to the brim with his trademark over-the-top gross-out humor -- but this time it has a purpose. It tells the simple story of a conservative housewife (played indelibly by Kathleen Turner) who murders whomever is unlucky enough to get on her nerves. While her husband (acclaimed actor Sam Waterston in a different light) and two children (Matthew Lillard and Ricki Lake) begin to suspect her criminal nature, the suburban town's death toll rises as more and more people make the mistake of p***ing her off. Turner's performance does for suburbia what Al Pacino in Scarface did for the mob: it wallows in its outlandish excess (Oscar snub, anyone?). The murder scenes themselves are so outrageous (they range from stabbing a man in the back with a poker and removing some anonymous inner organ to lambasting a woman with a pot roast) that the film can't help but NOT be taken seriously, and this is where it makes its point. As Stanley Kubrick did with A Clockwork Orange, Waters rubs our faces in our own inner obsession with violence -- but unlike others who have attempted this feat, he remembers to do more than just condemn his audience. Rather, he exposes us for what we really are -- and shows that he wouldn't have it any other way. While others might have stopped as soon as Turner is caught, Waters keeps the story moving throughout her trial -- which features the most entertaining act of courtroom self-defense since Woody Allen in Bananas. One of her killings involves dropping the stage lights at a concert on the head of her son's friend and then proceeding to set him on fire while the audience applauds her sadism, but Waters doesn't glorify the act: during the trial, the prosecutor displays photographs of the burnt corpse, but everyone in the courtroom is distracted by the presence of Suzanne Somers. Critics who have attacked Waters for being gratuitous are mistaken: he DOES show the consequences of the corrupt acts he depicts -- but he also reveals the sad truth, which is that no one really cares anymore. Along with taking on our culture's passion for depravity, the film also addresses our OTHER potentially dangerous problem: repressed conservative housewives. Having no life outside of the home, Turner is so obsessed with doing the best for her family that she's willing to (permanently) get rid of anyone who gets in the way. Rather than being frightening, her killings are just examples of how soccer-mom perfectionism can go too far. In one scene, a future victim of hers is watching Annie and singing along to \\\"Tomorrow\\\" while her dog licks her feet: now THAT'S frightening.  Grade: B+\", \"Beverly Sutphin (Kathleen Turner) seems to be a typical Betty Crocker suburban housewife. Unfortunately, people are dropping like flies around her! Could this perfect mom be a serial killer?   \\\"Serial Mom\\\" is a ridiculously charming and clever film that never really received the credit it deserved. It is John Waters' best mainstream film, and its tongue-in-cheek portrayal of suburbia, domesticity, the media, and conventional gender roles is delightfully subversive. Kathleen Turner was criminally underrated--this was her best performance to date. The dialogue is hilarious, the murders are wickedly funny, and the overall atmosphere of the film is disturbingly bright and shiny. Co-stars Waters regulars Mink Stole, Ricki Lake, Traci Lords, and features a dynamite cameo by grunge goddesses L7.

Even though I knew it was his first--and therefore probably cheesy--I still hoped for something of value. I was mostly disappointed. The production values were so incredibly awful they made Roger Corman movies look like epics; the lapses in logic were big enough to drive elephants through; and the acting was so bad it actually became entertaining. (I've never seen anyone \\\"act\\\" walking across a room before!) There were two saving graces: if you're in the mood for a blast from the past, the ultra-hip 70's feel is totally groovy, man; and if you still happen to have a dusty bag of grass in a drawer somewhere, this is the movie for which to bring it out.\", \"In 1976, L'il Davey Cronenberg must have seen how the US dominated Canadian culture. So he made Shivers, his first feature. On the surface, this movie is a fun horror romp, but unlike most generic horror films, it carries a deeper meaning.  Without giving too much away, Shivers (or \\\"They Came From Within\\\") deals with a virus that preys on civilians in a remote apartment complex, and turns them into sex-crazed zombies. The virus, which is the representation of America in the film, starts out in the host, and then quickly spreads throughout the building, much like American culture does in Canadian society. Soon the whole building is filled with mindless, sexual cravists...I think you can see where this is going. American films filled with sex, violence, and mindless story lines infecting Canadian cinemas? All signs point to this theme, and it's fun to watch this film, and pick out all the parallels. Although, if you're not for motifs, watch Shivers for the classic twisted horror Cronenberg brings to the screen. We are treated with references to Night Of The Living Dead and many other classic horror flicks along the way. In closing, if it says Cronenburg in the credits, you can guarantee a pretty grotesque/insane/outrageous experience.\", \"Shivers starts by introducing us, the viewer that is, to Starline Tower a luxury high rise apartment complex situated on an island. The only access is a bridge connecting the island to the nearest city which happens to be Montreal. Starline Tower is almost totally self contained with it's own shops, swimming pool, golf course & even it's own medical clinic manned by Dr. Roger St. Luc (Paul Hampton) & Nurse Forsythe (Lynn Lowry). On a seemingly ordinary day like any other something terrible is happening in Starline Tower, a university professor named Dr. Emil Hobbes (Fred Doederlein) has just brutally killed a young girl whom he was both having an affair with & using as a guinea pig for his bizarre experiments & he slits his own throat shortly after. Since he knew Dr. Hobbes Dr. St. Luc decides to do a little investigating himself & talks to Hobbes partner Rollo Linski (Joe Silver) who says that they were working on breeding a parasite that can take over the function of a diseased or damaged human organ. Meanwhile back at Starline Tower a resident named Janine Tudor (Susan Petrie) is worried about her husband Nicholas (Allan Kolman) as he seems 'very ill' which he is. Nicholas begins to vomit up leech like creatures that then start to bite & infect the other residents of Starline Tower who in turn go on a violent, sexual deviant rampage as the strange disease carried by these grotesque parasites spreads rapidly through Starline Tower. Dr. St. Luc & Nurse Forsythe discover the truth but while it may already be too late for Starline Tower & it's unfortunate residents they must stop the parasites from escaping the island & into the city where they will be all but impossible to stop...  This Canadian produced film also known as The Parasite Murders & They Came from Within, both Orgy of the Blood Parasites which would have been a fantastic name for a film & The Parasite Complex were apparently working titles, was written & directed by David Cronenberg. Shivers is considered to be his first proper film & I personally liked Shivers much more than the rest of Cronenberg's early films like The Brood (1979) & Scanners (1981) for instance. The script moves along at a nice pace & I never found it became boring unlike the Cronenberg films I've mentioned. I must also give Cronenberg credit for giving credibility & substance to a somewhat silly premise as he directs with deadly seriousness. Cronenberg throws in all sorts of everyday metaphors & messages as you would expect, the perils of sleeping around (you may get a parasite which will then possibly go on to infect the entire population of Earth!), modern scientific techniques, human isolation & the dangers of taking a bath & not noticing a large slug like creature crawling towards your privates! All of the characters are interesting & well flesh out so we actually care for them which helps the film enormously. Shivers doesn't contain much blood or gore, a few slimy parasites crawling around, the parasites themselves poking around around inside people causing their skin to bulge & a bit of blood is about as graphic as Shivers gets. Technically Shivers is a little on the rough side but this is to be expected since it was Cronenberg's first film, having said that it's not badly made but it's just not as polished as maybe you might expect from Cronenberg. Shivers was obviously a low budget film but Cronenberg managed to create a film better in style, atmosphere, substance & originality than the means & tools he had at his disposal would have suggested he could. The acting is pretty good & I suspect we have Cronenberg to thank for that, Joe Silver as Rollo Linski stands out in particular & dominates every scene he's in. Overall I enjoyed Shivers more than much of Cronenebrg's early films & I'd say definitely worth watching for both fans of Cronenberg & horror in general.\", \"Watching this again after a gap of so many years I was amazed at how much sex there was in it. I remembered the nasty little dog prick like parasites that get inside and cause the skin to undulate horribly. I also remembered the whole exclusive accommodation block concept (just looks really 70's now!) but I did not recall that this was a bit of a swipe at the free lovers and swingers of the time, most interesting. Much under rated this movie wastes no time in getting going, so far so fast in fact that with the knickers showing, then nude teen girl getting killed so vigorously before we know what is going on, a most uncomfortable start. Still, 'comfortable' and Cronenberg are not words that many would use together. This is a truly fine feature debut and whilst budgetary constrictions make a little of it look slightly amateurish this takes nothing from the overall effect and let us not forget that this much overlooked film was an obvious inspiration for Alien.\", \"In a posh apartment building there seems to be more to a bizarre murder/suicide than first apparent. When this proves to be the case a scheme by an eccentric biology researcher to fund his project come to light and we see what led to the initial grisly murder. The resulting aftermath is even more horrifying.  David Cronenberg's first feature film has all the visceral themes of his early works and they are executed with a vengeance. Venturing far into dark and unsettling horror territory Cronenberg crafts a spiraling nightmare of zombie outbreak and promiscuous sex. The film is almost a prelude to the much revered \\\"Dawn of the Dead\\\" by George Romero as it shows the beginning of a zombie outbreak. It is also better and much richer in its story and horror metaphor though the characterizations are slightly more shallow than in \\\"Dawn of the Dead.\\\" But the presentation of the irrational horror and unsettling gore is at least on par with \\\"Dawn,\\\" despite this film's many obvious limitations.  That makes for a must see for horror fans and this is a great first film from a great director. 9/10  Rated R for graphic violence and gore\", \"Hard to believe that I once thought this ludicrously daft horror-comedy, (although I'm not sure the laughs are intentional), was about the sickest movie I'd ever seen. It is fairly nasty in a visceral sort of way but it's also derivative, (it's \\\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\\" in all but name), and appallingly acted, (look out, in particular, for the elderly European couple with the walking frame), so that any serious point it may be making is lost. It's really another mad scientist movie, in this case the creation is a parasite, part aphrodisiac, part venereal disease, let loose in a self-contained Montreal apartment block. It could be seen as an AIDS metaphor and it's full of Cronenberg's usual queasy motifs but it's also pretty terrible.\", \"David Cronenberg's Shivers is a very clever, calculated piece of film making. The fashion it's made in is very similar to George A Romero's Dawn of the Dead, being lo-fi and confrontational, with a rich vein of social commentary running under the madness. Shivers is a disturbing concept, made unnervingly believable with it's low-budget realism.  The basic premise of Shivers is this, a mad scientist unleashes a parasitic organism into an apartment complex that multiplies rapidly and turns its hosts into sex-crazed zombies, with the goal of bringing man back to his savage roots. Cue lots of scenes of people charging down corridors in attempts to rape everybody they can get their hands on, and mass orgies in various bits of the complex.  As you can tell, Shivers intends to disturb. In fact, it doesn't waste ANY time getting on with that, opening with a scene that intercuts a new couple being shown around the complex with the graphic strangulation and dissection of a young girl (I might add though NOT a minor as many have suggested). This scene is later put into direct context by the rest of the movie but it's a stark, shocking opening to a stark shocking film.  Unless you've been living under a rock for the past thirty years, you've probably heard a lot about how sick and warped Cronenberg's films and the man himself are. Rubbish. Shivers is shocking yes, but that isn't the point of the movie. Through the medium of scary worm like parasites and hordes of horny zombies, Cronenberg manages to effectively flag up a warning about the potential dangers of an increasingly sexualised society, and seems to wrestle with a lot of internal demons. He also works a lot of warmth and wit into the movie. In fact the bottom line with Shivers is that if you can stomach the graphic violence and dizzying horror of the concept, Shivers is a very human, emotive movie. The cast are all very convincing, and by and large the characters are very likable, meaning you will be rooting for them.  So, I'll recommend Shivers whole-heartedly, but it is NOT for the faint of heart. It'll probably disgust conservative viewers, and I understand totally that the idea of a movie that's about the spread of a mutant parasite that turns you into a brain dead rapist is probably not gonna be for everyone, but if you dig intelligent horror, especially that of the 60s and 70s, Shivers'll probably be a movie you'll really dig.\", \"Satire on the sexual seventies? Parable on man's growing devotion to science? Simple horror film? It just might be all three. You could also put this in the Invasion of the Body Snatchers or Living Dead mold, a group that never stops, you either become one or die. However you look at this movie, it is real fun. There are plenty of gore scenes, most featuring strange growths on people. Then, there is also a heaping helping of bare breasts. My favorite scene is where one of the hotel staff tricks a couple into a large room where a parasite orgy is going on. He undresses while sticking out his tongue. Now, that is scary. The sole weakness of the film is that it is seriously dated, some scenes are funny now simply because of people's clothing. But the best joke of the movie is intentional; when sex is the sickness, who doesn't want it?  P.S. They Came From Within is the the best of titles, but It Comes From Within would have been better.\", \"I like Cronenberg. I even wrote a paper on \\\"Dead Ringers\\\" in a film class, so I am not coming to this movie unbiased.  I enjoy horror movies, but usually find that the horror movies from the 70s are drastically lacking in anything worth keeping. For example: \\\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\\" is one of my least liked movies not for the movie itself, but for the fact that by time I saw it I had seen so many others do the same thing much better many times before. I was underwhelmed.  Not so with \\\"Shivers,\\\" which does an excellent job of dealing with horror standards (the good doctor, the mad doctor, secluded victims, and a parasite/disease/curse running rampant) and not kowtowing to the standard uses of them.  Sure, we can read \\\"Shivers\\\" as being a warning about the excess of promiscuous sex and the lack of control human beings exhibit when it comes to sex, potentially leading to hedonism (if not a modern Sodom and Gomorrah) and, eventually, death. That's an easy read for any kid in Film 101 to do.  But the movie does actually work on the very superficial level that a horror movie should: It horrifies, terrifies and titillates (and with a young Lynn Lowry in the nurse's role you know very well it's going to titillate). Sitting through the entire movie becomes well worth it simply for the sensual, seductive, and scary shot of Lowry in the pool at the end.  This movie, like much of Cronenberg's work, is designed to make you think, but it also to reaches into the basest emotions you have. Lowry, Susan Petrie, and Barbara Steele (can we say \\\"MILF\\\" in a review?) become objects of lust for the viewer (yes, this is assuming the viewer is male and/or into women, I agree) just as we know that the film is a warning to us about the excesses of sex and emotion.  Not all of Cronenberg's work is great art, but \\\"Shivers\\\" is one of those movies that has stood the test of time and continues to work. Considering how few movies from the 70s can say that, I take my hat off to you, Mr. Cronenberg.\", \"\\\"Shivers\\\" of 1975 is a nasty and highly entertaining exploitation flick and furthermore the first feature film directed by cult filmmaker David Cronenberg. Although this does not yet reach the greatness of Cronenberg movies such as \\\"Scanners\\\", \\\"The Dead Zone\\\" or \\\"The Fly\\\", \\\"Shivers\\\" is definitely an atmospheric and creepy film that delivers gore, shocks and sleaze and, in spite of resemblances to films like \\\"Night Of The Living Dead\\\", quite some originality. This movie of many aka. titles (such as \\\"They Came From Within\\\" and \\\"The Parasite Murders\\\") is furthermore recommended as it features the great Barbara Steele (my all-time favorite actress) in a supporting role, as a lesbian.  Scientists have developed a certain form of parasites that are supposed to replace organs. What the scientists have not thought of, however, are the side-effects. Their disgustingly looking little parasites are not only anything but healthy, they also turn people into braindead and murderous sex maniacs...  This movie's wicked story and atmosphere as well as the nasty sleaze and gore make \\\"Shivers\\\" a real treat for a fan of exploitation. Barbara Steele is, as always, great in her supporting role. Apart from Steele, the performances are not too memorable, bu that doesn't lower the movie's quality as a highly entertaining little classic of weird exploitation cinema. Fans of David Cronenberg should definitely not miss \\\"Shivers\\\", a film that I highly recommend to any lover of bizarre Horror and exploitation cinema!\", \"When I first tried to watch this film, I was around ten or eleven and though it was lame, boring and disturbing. Nowadays I'm a huge fan of Cronenberg and think that this is a quality film. It's not without its issues, the characters mostly aren't terribly interesting and neither are the actors, and the writing and direction are efficient and sometimes ace, but not as overall gripping as Cronenberg's later works. However, the plot is genius, a kind of twisted allegorical look at sexual revolution and the bourgeoisie, and the crude but effective special effects make for many effective shock scenes. Of the acting, Barbara Steele stands out the most, though her role isn't too big, she is as majestic a horror queen as she was when she began and the role makes best use of her. The main lady with infected husband is pretty decent too, although her role is kinda thin. The film is watchable throughout though it does feel often like somewhat of a b movie. The ending is fantastic though, showcasing Cronenbergs subversive wizardry. Altogether, this is an influential, highly entertaining grisly sci fi horror classic, just a whisker away from the directors superlative later work.\", \"Undoubtedly one of the most frightening things about David Cronenberg's debut feature film \\\"Shivers' to modern audiences, is the cavalcade of sheer 1970s \\\"look\\\" in both interior decor and clothing. The apartment building in which this zombie sex party occurs somehow becomes a character of its own, celebrating material ugliness as a mirror to the human ugliness which eventually occurs within it's soulless interiors. Somehow, the patina of years passed since the filming of this movie has rendered \\\"Shivers\\\" a more gut-wrenching experience. Which is worse, having a parasite (which is an obvious metaphor for fecal matter) shoved down your throat by a sex-crazed maniac or having to live in a boxy cinder-block apartment that boasts both zebra-print and daisy-print wallpaper battling for dominance in the same tiny kitchen? Still, this slice of Cronenberg's diseased reverence for \\\"the flesh\\\" carries the same \\\"I need a shower now\\\" feeling when it ends, as it did when it first unspooled on movie screens back in the day. Say what you like about this truly nasty movie, it broke a huge number of societal taboos and went many places other directors feared to go. Memorable set pieces include the appearance of the waiter at the elevator door, squeezing some kind of cherry crepes between his fingers before raping a mother and daughter...the daughter will have the dessert for her own when the door reopens. The two gay men in bathing suits who stand outside a door shielding the doctor, whispering \\\"hey..you wanna go to a party?\\\" through the peephole. The ugly woman attacking the waiter screaming \\\"I'm hungry for love!\\\". The two little girls on a leash on the basement stairs, barking. While dated, \\\"Shivers\\\" still packs a punch by daring to show the loves that dare not speak their names. Ugly wallpaper optional, but just try to block out the paper shade lamp-covers in the bedroom of the happy young married couple. Unforgettable!\", \"A parasite that's \\\"a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal disease, and will hopefully turn the world into one beautiful, mindless orgy\\\" is unleashed in a luxurious Canadian hotel. Despite director/writer David Cronenberg's script, \\\"Shivers\\\" isn't any great shakes as a bloody erotic horror. Mr. Cronenberg shows promise, however; and, there are at least three sexy scenes. First, you have luscious Lynn Lowry (as Forsythe) sexily undressing. Also, still beautiful Barbara Steele (as Betts) takes a bath; and, later, engages Susan Petrie (as Janine Tudor) in a seductive Lesbian kiss. Other than that, the movie features more bad hair than anything else. Cronenberg could have gotten off more steam by setting the maniacal sex parasites loose in a college. Paul Hampton (as Roger St Luc) emerges as the last man standing. Imaginatively re-titled \\\"They Came from Within\\\" and \\\"The Parasite Murders\\\".  **** Shivers (10/10/75) David Cronenberg ~ Paul Hampton, Lynn Lowry, Barbara Steele, Joe Silver\", \"This is one horror movie I would find sexually moving. \\\"Shivers\\\" is a movie that is mostly that way itself. Here you have a apartment complex that has a lot of couples there. Unknown to anyone, there's something unnatural going on. One doctor makes a parasite that should replace a diseased organ. That plan did work, however, the side-effect was increased sexual desire. Once that gets out, all hell's break loose. The young girl whom he had an affair with is the first, the second victim is the guy who works for a firm keeps a secret from his wife. The more people getting infected by these parasites, the wilder eerything gets. Everyone wants the desire for sex. Well, there's no telling how an infected person looks like. The only way you can tell is when you're getting mobbed by these horny, over-sexed freaks. Like most zombie movies you would smel dead flesh in the air. In \\\"Shivers' it's not love, it's sex, and it's wild. This movie should be titled, \\\"Invasion of the Sex Fiends\\\". But that title can be considered pornographic! 3 out of 5 stars!\", \"A virulent strain of ugly and lethal parasites turn the residents of a swanky deluxe apartment complex into depraved sex-crazed fiends. Doctor Roger St. Luc (the hopelessly bland Paul Hampton) and his amiable colleague Rollo Linsky (a wonderfully engaging portrayal by Joe Silver) try to figure out what's going on before it's too late. Writer/director David Cronenberg concocts an unsparingly bleak meditation on the horrors of mankind being reduced to sheer psychotic libido impulses (check out the scene with a homely fat middle-aged woman jumping a younger man while exclaiming \\\"I'm hungry for love!\\\") and does a sound job of creating and maintaining a cold, icky tone which becomes more increasingly creepy and unnerving as the grim narrative progresses towards a wild pull-out-all-the-stops climax which plays like a perverted version of \\\"Night of the Living Dead.\\\" The acting is rather hit or miss: Hampton barely registers as the insipid would-be hero, the ever-alluring Lynn Lowry contributes a memorably sexy turn as the enticing Nurse Forsythe, Barbara Steele projects her usual sense of class and commanding presence as poised lesbian Betts, Allan Kolman does well as the infected Nicholas Tudor, and pretty Susan Petrie likewise impresses as Tudor's sweet, distraught wife Janine. Moreover, this picture comes through with several effectively nasty moments: the jolting opening with a deranged old scientist murdering his teenage mistress, cutting opening her abdomen, and pouring acid in her stomach prior to slitting his own throat; Betts being violated by a parasite while taking a bath, a parasite attacking Linsky by attaching itself to his face, and a brief, yet startling shot of two little kids on leashes walking on all fours and barking like dogs. Robert Saad's plain cinematography presents a credible evocation of everyday pedestrian reality while the spare, chilling score does the shuddery trick. Joe Blasco's hideously ghastly and gruesome make-up f/x deliver the disgusting goods. Plus there's a wickedly twisted sense of blithely morbid black humor at work throughout. Not peak Cronenberg, but still worthwhile and engrossing all the same.\", \"Oh, YEAH!!! Now THIS is what I'm talking' about!  If you want to know who established a new direction towards more originality in horror, you almost don't have to look much further than David Cronenberg. On limited budgets, with practically no-name casts (at least in his earlier work), he created some of the nastiest little gems a horror hound could ever hope to skid across! Where Stanley Kubrick's excursions into sci-fi/horror warned that man's faith in technology would eventually betray and destroy him, David said, \\\"Uh-UNHN, baby! Your body will turn against you first, way before that happens!\\\"  He'd said it before quite effectively in his first full-length feature, RABID. Then he took it to the next level with SHIVERS, (released in this country as THEY CAME FROM WITHIN.)  At a swanky (well, for the '70's, anyway) and relatively isolated apartment complex outside of Montreal, a young doctor is about to discover the horrifying price for his relentless ambition, (as all well-intended mad doctors must.)  In an attempt to develop a living organism that would potentially replace failing human organs as a viable substitute, he has instead created a highly contagious parasite, which infects its victims by means of almost any physical or sexual contact and turns them into deranged, sex-crazed zombies! Once the doctor thought he was the master of his creation, but now he is the Host! And for his mistake, everyone else in the complex is about to pay the ultimate price.  Though you could say that SHIVERS \\\"borrows\\\" its influence from movies like William Castle's THE TINGLER or the cult favorites THE FLESH EATERS or FIEND WITHOUT A FACE, Cronenberg has put more thought - and a lot more gore - behind his movie than any of those. Plus you just can't go wrong when a movie allows Scream Queen Legend Barbara Steele to strip down and get naked in a bathtub scene...which is only sexy for about a minute, and I won't say more than THAT.  Well, whatever inspired him to make it, Cronenberg in turn 'infected' countless other filmmakers with his vision of parasitic terror, and many, many horror films since have duplicated the SHIVERS vibe, (NIGHT OF THE CREEPS, THE HIDDEN, SLUGS and most recently the excellent SLITHER, just to name a few.)   Though the low-budget is pretty obvious and some things about it are dated, (this WAS over thirty years ago, after all), Cronenberg still stages some scenes of horror here that will have you open-mouthed with shock and surprise. (Considering the plot of SHIVERS, though, you may want to keep your mouth shut...as much as possible!)\", \"On Starliner Island, you have luxury high-rise living with deluxe accommodations, including a delicatessen, a boutique, a doctor and a dentist, dry cleaning, and parasitic sexually transmitted slugs that are taking over the population. What more could you ask for? Now, I realize that this is made in 1974, but I don't exactly buy the \\\"luxury\\\" apartment living thing, for this high-rise is the epitome of tackiness, and most of it seems to be furnished in ultra-modern poor taste.  But enough of that, on to the important stuff, as the film opens and an excited young couple come to view apartments. This is interspersed with scenes of an elderly man as he chases a woman in a school-girl uniform around one of these lovely dwellings, eventually captures her, and cuts her open on the dining table and pours acid inside of her. And then, he cuts his own throat. How's that for an opening scene? Well, it seems that this man is a doctor, and he was experimenting with a sort of parasite that was part aphrodisiac and part something else. And Anabelle Brown, she of the school-girl uniform, was his test subject. The problem is, that Annabelle was rather well known (and liked, apparently) by many men within this complex and had frequent visits from them, and therefore she has shared this little parasite with them.  The resident doctor, Roger St. Luc, has visited with an old college professor of his, Rollo (played by Cronenberg regular, Joe Silver), and has found out more of the deceased man's background and what he was up to. And that gives him a bit of insight as to what's going on at Starliner Island, although, not quite enough to deal with the problem. Dr. St. Luc as a rather interesting hairstyle, too, kind of an extreme wind-blown look, perhaps achieved by applying spray after coming in out of a gale.  At any rate, the parasites are moving from person to person & also can survive outside of the body, but are always looking for new bodies to host them, so they aren't outside for long. And pretty soon the whole complex is full of sex-crazed murderous lunatics. Our intrepid doctor is determined not to become one of them and it does seem he's one of the last holdouts, but unfortunately not for long.  And then, after all the fun is over at home, why not take a drive to Montreal? It is, after all, only minutes away.  This is an impressive debut and definitely different and original for the time in which it was made. Cronenberg is rather a master at incorporating the creepy and nasty into \\\"everyday life\\\" and this was just a taste of things to come.  8 out of 10.\", \"There was a time when the drive-in was the place to be; it was at the drive-in that one could find gems like ISLAND OF THE DAMNED (an Italian fright film that began with a group of people coming ashore on an apparently deserted island, only to find that all of the adults on the island have been murdered by the children- a film that may very well have inspired the vastly inferior CHILDREN OF THE CORN). For some unknown reason, ISLAND OF THE DAMNED isn't even listed on the IMDb. David Cronenberg's first feature, THEY CAME FROM WITHIN (a.k.a., SHIVERS), is. Creepy in the extreme, THEY CAME FROM WITHIN is the type of grex that Cronenberg may have had in mind when he said this: \\\"Art is the tree of Life, Science is the tree of Death.\\\" When Dan O'Bannon and Ridley Scott set about remaking Mario Bava's PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES (as ALIEN), they borrowed liberally from a number of sources- including the \\\"chest-bursters\\\" from THEY CAME FROM WITHIN. The final scene had great significance for us as we drove slowly out of the drive-in that night, into the waiting darkness...\", \"so these leeches get in you and turn you into a sex crazed zombie. that's the plot. this flick has exactly what makes a horror movie good: despair and hopelessness. it leaves you wondering, \\\"how this boy gonna get out of this situation?!\\\" and the hero of this flick, roger, he catches on to what's going' down right away, and acts like a true boy from the word go. what's he do when some hottie tries to get all up on him during the mayhem? knocks her out without a second thought, of course.  cronenberg always delivers. horror fans, watch this, and take some notes.\", \"'Shivers' was the first major horror movie from Canadian film maker David Cronenberg, future director of 'The Brood', 'Scanners', 'Rabid', 'Videodrome', and the remake of 'The Fly'. I saw it in 1979 when it played on a double-bill with 'Rabid'. Afterwards, I found I had missed the last bus, and had to walk home three miles along a dimly-lit country road. You have no idea how scared I was! ( film critic Barry Norman said he felt like throwing up in the gutter after watching it ).   Shot in Montreal and on a low budget, 'Shivers' is set in a newly opened posh apartment block. One of the residents, a doctor, is struggling with a schoolgirl. He overpowers her, puts her under anaesthetic, and opens her stomach, before pouring acid into it. He then cuts his own throat with a scalpel.  He has created a strain of parasites intended to replace malfunctioning internal organs but which are now out of control. Resembling big worms, these bugs are passed onto people via sexual intercourse. Annabelle, the schoolgirl, has slept with every man in the building. Once infected, the victims - male and female, young and old alike - spread the plague to others, who then vomit blood and bugs all over the place. A small group of people try to escape but the victims have sealed the exits and cut off the phone lines.  This is 'Night Of The Living Dead' with an interesting, perverse twist. The zombies don't want to eat you, they want to make love to you! In common with many other '70's horror films, the lack of money proved advantageous as film makers had to rely on their imaginations to create terror, rather than fall back on the safety net of special effects. Romero, Carpenter, DePalma, and Cronenberg et al produced some of the finest horror pictures of all time in this period.  The cast of 'Shivers' were mainly unknowns, except for Barbara Steele, star of numerous horror classics such as 'Black Sunday' and 'Pit & The Pendulum'. Again this works in the film's favour. You feel as though you are watching real people in danger.  No special effects as such, except for Joe Blasco's 'creatures' and they are suitably disgusting. You won't eat a Hot Dog again after seeing this film! Despite the somber mood, there are a few touches of humour, such as a bug landing on someone's umbrella, and a man in a laundry room being ambushed by an obese, unattractive woman who wants his body: \\\"I am hungry for love!\\\". Yuck! One idea Cronenberg would not get away with today is the lift scene in which a mother and her young daughter are confronted by an infected man. The intimation is that he has sex with both of them. The leashed girls crawling around on all fours also probably would not be done now.  It is a gripping and terrifying film, but not for everyone - at least one person walked out during the screening I attended in 1979 - and also manages to make a serious comment about the nature of human sexuality. The world the infected wish to create - where everybody makes love all the time - sounds attractive, but what would it means in terms of depersonalisation? ( I know what you are thinking. Who cares? )  'Shivers' should not be remade. It was of its time. I would hate to see it redone with lashings of C.G.I. and all its intelligence removed.\", \"Cronenberg's first movie of note, Shivers (AKA They Came from Within), is the director's first attempt at tackling a theme that would eventually become his trademark: the progression of man's evolution through technology. The result isn't as polished as his later films, with less considered direction and weak performances from some members of the cast, but the film still manages to impress thanks to Cronenberg's innovative story, some impressive make-up FX (by Joe Blasco) and a few very memorable scenes.  Set in Starliner Towers, an exclusive self-sufficient apartment block isolated on an island, Shivers stars Paul Hampton as resident doctor, Roger St. Luc, who discovers that some of the building's occupants have become host to man-made parasites that heighten sexual desire to dangerous levels. As more and more of the residents become infected, Roger attempts to at first destroy the creatures, then contain the situation, and eventually, when the block is finally completely over-run by sex-mad 'zombies', escape from the island.  Although Shivers might not 'wow' today's audiences with dazzling special effects and technical brilliance, there are still plenty of unsettling scenes that make this movie worth a look, especially if you're a fan of the director's later work: an early death scene sees a man strangling a young woman, before cutting her open and pouring acid into her body cavity; Betts (Barbara Steele) gets a bath-time shock as one naughty, phallic parasite pops out of the plughole and nips up her cooch; Nicholas Tudor (Allan Kolman) wishes he hadn't been getting some on the sly when his stomach begins undulating in a rather uneasy fashion; and a brilliant, downbeat ending sees the horny islanders getting into their cars for a trip to the mainland.\", \"Although it's fairly safe to state that David Cronenberg delivered his greatest work during the 1980's (with genuine masterpieces such as \\\"The Fly\\\", \\\"Scanners\\\" and \\\"The Dead Zone\\\"), his 70's films definitely shouldn't be underestimated! Titles like \\\"The Brood\\\" or \\\"Rabid\\\" are solid cult-gems that truly proved that he was a gifted filmmaker whose talent would only increase with every new project he set his intelligent mind to. This \\\"Shivers\\\", released back in 1975, is yet another entirely different chapter in the Cronenberg success tale... It was the director's first long-feature film, made with an extremely low budget, but already showing his large interest in mixing shocking horror with subtle social criticism. Obviously inspired by the style and format of Romero's classic \\\"Night of the Living Dead\\\", the story focuses on the newest invention of some over-ambitious medics: genetically engineered parasites that are entered inside human guinea pigs and supposed to fully take over the functions of ill or dying organs. Naturally, this medical breakthrough isn't as effective as it should be, and all the inhabitants of a luxurious building complex are mutating into sex-craving zombies. In many ways, Cronenberg's cinematic debut feels like watching an authentic exploitation film! It's not just the low budget and the extreme use of gore; the odd casting, the twisted premise and the apocalyptic ending all feel very exploitation-like. Heck, this film even goes by several vicious alternate titles that sound like they only could have been invented by wicked exploitation distributors (for example: \\\"Orgy of the Blood Parasites\\\" or \\\"They Came from Within\\\"). I surely don't intend to make all this sound like it's a negative thing\\u0085on the contrary! \\\"Shivers\\\" is a truly bizarre and adrenalin-rushing movie containing loads of nasty gore, sleaze and morbid humor. Some of the dialogue is sensational (= \\\"man is an animal that thinks too much\\\" or \\\"dying is an act of eroticism\\\") and the fairly unknown cast does a great job portraying the sex-driven but mindless \\\"zombies\\\". There's a terrific supportive role for Barbara Steele! Nearly 15 years after her best role in \\\"Black Sunday\\\" she still is the yummiest witch queen of B-cinema! \\\"Shivers\\\" isn't exactly brilliant, but it's certainly better than most other contemporary horror films and it's a fascinating oddity showing where and how Cronenberg began his masterful career. Highly recommended!\", \"Man, what better response to George Romero's newly created zombie archetype could be better? Cronenberg's debut feature, though a little worn around the edges, is a spectacular funhouse, a dire warning, a potent sexualized anxiety creation, and best of all, a whole lotta fun.  The feature starts with an advertisement for a nice, secluded Yuppie apartment complex, sensually (and homoerotically) appealing to live in some paradise high rise removed from the greater degradation of Canadian society. Class, sexuality, fear, and setting are all established in one swift stroke. It's not long before the carnage begins.  See, it seems some mad scientist was using the inhabitants of this virtual Eden to test out some replacement for organ transplants: a parasite that is also \\\"a stimulant and an aphrodisiac\\\". Basically, a person loses a kidney and replaces it with a penis-shaped worm that makes he or she attack and have sex with almost everything in sight... such automatized lust is very zombie-like, but with the added bonus of maintaining language and critical thinking (at least enough critical thinking to not be stopped by doors, for instance). Yesss, it's not long before these worms have burst from the interior of some hapless young man to destroy the entire community into an orgiastic apocalypse.  And seriously, if terms like \\\"orgiastic apocalypse\\\" excite, intrigue, or compel you, this movie is right for your tastes. Cronenberg begins his body horror mentality by mixing sex, death, violence, disease, medicine, and technology at manic levels, something he has continued to do for over thirty years now. The movie is a little different from his usual work in that as an early feature, he used some of the more regular tropes of horror film-making such as monster cam and chiaroscuro (later, he would find he didn't even need these devices as the plots and concepts of his ideas were enough, and most of the horror he'd show would be in a much more direct exposition with much more open and regular spaces). The movie at one point literally becomes a sex/horror fun-house as each door is opened to reveal another act found by the mainstream to be sordid and degraded, from pedophilia to incest to homosexuality and everything in between, the underlying erotic impulses of the community is abjectly revealed.  What's fascinating about this movie is that it's kind of hard, from modern eyes, to see the end result as being too bad of a deal. The troubling part is the sexual violence and the attacks, but once it's all done, it's hard to discern the difference between consensual and exploitative. Do the characters in this movie, upon getting invaded by the worms, start doing things against their will, or do the worms merely excite a repressed desire that they finally act out? \\\"Everything is a sexual act\\\", a nurse says at one point, describing a dream she had to her impotent lover/hero figure. Such a theme will continue through almost everything Cronenberg would later film, as he would become the master of body horror.  --PolarisDiB\", \"The first big screen flick for Canadian horror master David Cronenberg was this skin-crawling B horror movie.  Residents of a high rise apartment building are being attacked by parasites that are turning them into crazed zombies with nothing but sexual assault on their minds!   Shivers is an effectively disturbing movie, not unlike most of Cronenberg's later horror classics. It's had a good hand in influencing later creature flicks. The story has a good premise and builds some terrific tension as it escalates to a great claustrophobic climax. What's clever about this movie is that most of the horror is suggested, we don't see the parasites much and their elusiveness just helps to create more tension. The makeup effects are decent for a low budgeter and the cast turn in some adequate performances, horror veteran Barbara Steele is a nice addition to the cast.  Shivers is a entertaining slice of B horror that manages to live up to its title well. A must-see for Cronenberg fans.  *** out of ****\", \"This film takes place at Starliner Towers, a high rise apartment complex isolated on an island and which is very self-sufficient. A biological experiment gone awry has led to the creation of slug-like parasites that, once inside a human body, turn people into ravenous sexual deviants. The buildings' in-house doctor, Roger St. Luc (Paul Hampton) becomes aware that the tenants are going mad, but will he be able to stem the tide of wanton sexual aggression on display here?  This was truly a groundbreaking film, not only for its director, David Cronenberg, who had previously only done \\\"underground\\\" films, but it paved the way for the future of the horror genre in Canada. Cronenberg may have been learning as he went along, making this film and its follow-up, \\\"Rabid\\\", and it's obviously not as polished as his subsequent works, but it's still very respectable, showing early on that he had a definite aptitude for this medium.  It's along the lines of his other early films to deal with \\\"body horror\\\": it's provocative, intriguing, violent, and unnerving. He offers such memorable and potent images as a bathtub scene featuring none other than the iconic actress Barbara Steele, and especially a late scene featuring two children on leashes and behaving as dogs. The films' action leads to an equally memorable \\\"Night of the Living Dead\\\" style finish.  Joe Blasco provides the film with some decent creature creations and splatter that are just fine for low budget fare. With the amount of gore and violence on hand, it goes without saying that this film won't be for everybody, and there was some uproar at the time of the theatrical release that Canadian tax dollars could be going towards making this kind of film.  Deep-voiced, sharp featured Joe Silver is wonderfully entertaining as the character who gives us all the necessary exposition, and the alluring cult actress Lynn Lowry is quite good as the nurse, making up for the blandness of male lead Hampton. Alan Migicovsky gets quite creepy as an early victim, who gets progressively more disgusting as the film goes on, Susan Petrie is cute and likable as his anguished wife, and guest star Steeles' presence is very welcome.  Suffice it to say, this film might not quite pack the same punch as Cronenbergs' later horror films, such as \\\"The Brood\\\", \\\"Scanners\\\", \\\"Videodrome\\\", or \\\"The Fly\\\", but I think it's a solid debut with an offbeat premise and an effective delivery.  7/10\", \"I suppose if you've never seen any of Romero's zombie films, or his \\\"Crazies\\\", or even Cronenberg's \\\"Rabid\\\" and \\\"The Fly\\\", you might be impressed by this film. But for even a mildly seasoned horror fan, there is nothing especially interesting here. Of course it's Cronenberg's first feature-length film, so it's worth seeing for historical reasons, but the script is boring, monotonous, unfocused and it lacks an engaging protagonist. There are some disturbing moments (the opening fight/murder, where we don't even know who the villain is; the barking kids; the bathtub scene), but the film lacks a clear idea of how it wants to portray the \\\"infected\\\" people; most of the time they behave like energetic sex maniacs, but at other times they become the plodding zombies of the \\\"NOTLD\\\" variety. (*1/2)\", \"SHIVERS (aka THEY CAME FROM WITHIN) is another pretty twisted outing from freak-o Canadian director David Cronenburg. SHIVERS is not nearly as memorable as some of Cronenburg's other works (VIDEODROME, THE FLY or my personal favorite - THE BROOD...) but it is still worth a look for anyone that is into Cronenburg's strange cinema.  SHIVERS is about parasites that enter their human hosts and cause them to do all kinds of strange sexual and violent things. Pretty cool concept that is handled well, and the film is both weird and entertaining as only Cronenburg can do it. Again, not the best of his films by any means, but still solid. Give it a shot - 7.5/10\", \"Cronenberg's directorial feature film debut is built around a now-familiar amalgamation of sex, technology, and medicine gone mad. The Canadian \\\"Shivers\\\" (original American release title \\\"They Came From Within\\\", aka \\\"The Parasite Murders\\\") opens with a slide show advertising a creepily perfect-sounding high-rise apartment building isolated on an island but just minutes away from downtown Montreal. We are told that the complex contains practically everything necessary to maintain a comfortable life- medical and dental practices, clothing stores, a gift shop, a deli, recreation, etc. Ideally, it would seem, the only reasons a resident would leave would be to work, socialize with non-residents, or take a vacation, if that wasn't too redundant. But of course, something terrible is just under the polished surface.   Cronenberg's direction is obviously not as polished as in later features, but we begin to see his signature style translated well into a full-length format.\", \"An early piece from David Cronenberg, this is his first cinematic exploration of themes which he would continually come back to throughout his career in films such as eXistenZ, Videodrome, The Fly and Crash. to best explain these themes, i must qoute the man himself, \\\"I was saying, I love sex, but I love it as a veneral disease. I am Syphilis. I am Enthusiastic about it, but in a very different way from you.\\\" and while that doesnt shed a whole lot of light on the film, it sure is a hell of a qoute :) the plot of Shivers, aka The Parasite Murders, revolves around a parasite which has been bred to heighten sexual desire and other primal instincts while dampening our mental awareness. this parasite has been let lose within a high-tech high rise block thanks to the experiments upon a young girl by an older scientist. the horror begins immediately, as do the social metaphors and ideas of sex and death. it is interesting to note this film was produced before the outbreak of AIDs, but is entirely applicable in our modern world. in some ways this is a tale of warning, of what can go wrong and how we can destroy ourselves. but above all, cronenberg delights in sinking us into the flesh, so the film can also be seen as fable of a world gone mad with life and freedom, which many would not consider so horrific. it defies simple catergorisation, it is not just a story about rampantly sexually active teenagers like so many of its kind. it is a story about every person's desire for safety, and the darker desires which hide behind it. wonderfully directed, intriguingly written, there is little that i can fault this film for, except perhaps its little to obvious reference to Romero's Night Of The Living Dead. while it is obviously partly inspired by that film, and brilliantly reinterprets it for a new age and a new social strata, the tiresome zombies that stagger about like slugs are a little out of place, but fortunately it does not let the film down. a must see.\", \"In the fancy Starliner compound in an island near Montreal, a mad scientist tests a parasite in the body of his mistress. He believes that man is an animal that thinks too much, and he develops a parasite to increase the violence and sexual desire of mankind. There is an outbreak in the condominium, with the fierce dwellers becoming zombies of sex.  \\\"Shivers\\\" is the first movie of this great Canadian cult director David Cronenberg, indeed a very low budget trash movie, with a final cost of US$ 179.000,00. The story mixes humor and horror and the effects are very nasty and disgusting, a trademark of Cronenberg. The story is a kind of sexual version of \\\"The Night of the Living Dead\\\", with people turning out zombies of sex. The screenplay of 1979 \\\"Alien\\\" used many concepts of this movie. The interview of David Cronenberg in the DVD is excellent, and it is very funny to know that the actress Sue Patrick asked him to slap her face in the scenes that she needed to cry, and Barbara Steele reaction to this physical assault.

Its far too long and pointless.\", \"A good movie scene can become a clich\\u00e9, but a clich\\u00e9 can't become a good movie scene. Not unless it's \\\"Airplane,\\\" and this isn't, it's \\\"Silverado,\\\" director Lawrence Kasdan's heartfelt but cluttered Valentine to the Western.  Heading west, reformed outlaws Emmett (Scott Glenn) and Paden (Kevin Kline) become a band, first by springing Emmett's wild brother Jake (Kevin Costner), then by getting saved from a posse by Mal (Danny Glover), crack shot with a Henry rifle. Then it's off to the beckoning town of Silverado, where Paden finds the bar of his dreams while the others are reunited with family. All is great - until trouble rides in.  \\\"There's nothing' wrong with the land,\\\" says Emmett's sister Kate (Patricia Gaul), \\\"it's just some of the people.\\\" That goes for Silverado the movie, too. Kasdan was coming off a bumper crop of hits as screenwriter and director, and thus had the ability to do whatever he wanted and work with whoever he wanted in 1985. He had some trouble cutting down on the scope of his ambition. \\\"Silverado\\\" is a big sprawling epic of a western with one of the most eclectic casts ever brought together. Kasdan and his co-writer, brother Mark, didn't know what to do with what they had, and it shows.  Rosanna Arquette is the most obvious casualty, playing a homesteader who floats around the edges of the story. Kasdan admits much of the point of her character was lost on the cutting-room floor. But even parts that made the final cut seem uneven and sketchy. Linda Hunt won the Oscar just before this was made, but she doesn't seem to have any purpose in the story except to trade rueful japes with Kline playing a bar matron with a good heart. Jeff Goldblum drifts in as a gambler, like Kline and Gaul a member of the cast of Kasdan's last hit \\\"The Big Chill.\\\" When he played a cowboy in \\\"Buckaroo Banzai,\\\" it was supposed to be a joke, but here it's for real, only it isn't as Goldblum never finds a character who serves no point anyway. Glover just glowers lifelessly about \\\"what ain't right.\\\" Even Kline, a favorite of mine, feels shallow and flat here. Wearing a beard and duster don't make you a cowboy.  The bad guys come off even worse. Brian Dennehy is their leader, Cobb, who smiles wryly in that Dennehy way and never kicks it into the next gear. He's still got that wry smile on when he faces down old friend Paden at the end. His gang lacks any sense of motivation or personality. \\\"Why are they doing this?\\\" someone asks, only to be answered: \\\"Because they enjoy it.\\\" That's not enough to go on here.  The editing is atrocious. Action scenes lack spatial reality. Less than a minute after some bad guys appear out of nowhere to ambush Emmett, Mal pops out of nowhere to ambush them. A few seconds after we see Jake riding out after some villains, he's in a bar getting into a fight over a girl. Kasdan shot too much footage, and without any organic flow to begin with, the result is a hazy mess.  So what did I like? Costner surprisingly plays a goofball to good effect, and Glenn does nice work in the lead Cooper-Wayne role. The opening scenes, of him and Paden finding each other and springing Jake, have a nice flow to them. John Cleese is another example of stunt casting here, only it pays off as Cleese finds a nice blend of humor and menace playing a lawman who's not a bad guy, just narrow and selfish.  But then \\\"Silverado\\\" descends into clich\\u00e9, bouncing from rustlers' hideout to stampede to showdown in mechanical fashion. It never bores you completely; its desire to entertain is palpable throughout, but it never rises above predictability.  \\\"What a waste,\\\" Dennehy says at the end. I couldn't agree more.\", \"At the start, you think that this is going to be a Western with a sense of humor. The latter quickly gets replaced with lots of Peckinpaugh-like bloodshed with a few in-jokes and a smattering of very black humor. Kasdan's direction and writing is too clever by half, and his characters too one-note and wooden. Even Jeff Goldblum is robbed of any humorous affects. Kevin Costner started earning his \\\"wooden\\\" reputation on this one, and Berenger is relentless. The plotline is internally inconsistent. Only Linda Hunt provides this mess's saving graces with a magnificent turn as a Pirate-Jenny-of-the West. Overall, one of the most disappointing westerns I have ever sat through.\", \"This is one of the MOST derivative films I've ever seen. \\\"L'auteur\\\" Kasdan rips off so many other great westerns (including, of course, the daddy...\\\"Shane\\\") that it's hard to keep count. There was absolutely NO suspense to this film, the acting was mailed in, and the plot...well, enough.  Actually, this is a great film if you don't have time to watch a lot of other westerns. Just rent \\\"Silverado\\\" and you'll see them.  A \\\"1\\\"...should be a zero.\", \"Went to this movie with my dad when we were in Minnesota. I loved it years ago, but seeing it again changed my mind. Maybe it was being a kid or styles change with time. (ie 80's action) This movie is too over the top for me. I will watch a bit of it, but not rent it. 4/10\", \"Kinda dull plot, poor direction & editing, clich\\u00e9s left and right, and it really isn't the epic western it aspires to be. The performances are pretty good, although Glenn has some trouble acting hurt. Costner does his usual devil-may-care Jeff Bridges impersonation, Dennehy is over-the-top, Danny Glover does what he can in a tired role, Linda Hunt is always fun to watch, and Jeff Goldblum, as was his mien for the 1980s, totally steals the show as Slick. Most of the characters remain fairly thin, with the ones in black hats relying entirely on comic-book personas. Costumes are kinda lame, with the hats seeming to rely on what was available in department stores of the 80s. Rifles shoot tiny holes in people, the good guys never miss, and the music is far too ambitious. Once Upon a Time in the West this is not.\", \"Silverado is a movie I watch frequently only because, like seeing a shocking accident, I feel compelled to review this horrible memory and ease my disbelief.  Silverado arrives as a typical Western, with your typical heroes, villains, women, farmers, town in turmoil, obligatory ranch, saloon for the inevitable fight scenes, some evil-doing cowhands, personal vendettas, ultimate gunfights in front of a church no less, and oh yes, even a stampede.  Silverado covers all the bases and zealously steals every Western clich\\u00e9' available. It has no teeth and its story fails to be daringly different. It lacks a serious lesson, other than good triumphs over evil only if evil gets careless, and it begs the question, \\\"Why did you make this film?\\\"   The answer lies somewhere in the conceptual thinking of the writers, who tragically missed an opportunity to take a talented ensemble and make a poignant and meaningful film that actually had the potential to send a true message.

I thought it was silly, and a bit over the top. I did like the performances of Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker, however the others were just... boring.  Now I like B movies, I really do, but this was a bit further down the alphabet for me. I saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to \\\"Army Of Darkness\\\" and \\\"Shaun of the Dead\\\", as well as \\\"On par with The Re-Animator\\\". You must be joking. I didn't find this film funny, it tried, it did make an effort, (possibly too much of an effort), but it failed in my opinion. By the time I was hit with the 3rd or 4th one-liner I was rolling my eyes and checking my watch.  There were definitely homages made to several other films, which is always cool, kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans. But here it may have just been a lack of original thought. Admittedly there were some nice special effects, good gore, but that can't carry an entire movie. The mutated Grant looked like a cross between Jabba the Hut, and in the early stages of mutation- Chet from \\\"Weird Science\\\" (after he was turned into the monster) and one of the alien creature/children from \\\"The Explorers\\\". It just didn't work. I thought it looked like something some kid from Grade 5 art class could have designed. Then there was Brenda, the woman that Grant impregnated and chained up in the barn. When help finally arrived she looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped. The design once again was totally unimaginative. A round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle. *yawn*   Now about the zombies- The more movies I see with zombies in them these days the more I wish George A. Romero had a patent on them and was the only writer/director allowed to make movies about them. He's the only person so far to do it right, with the exception of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (but that was a comedy). Oh, and Danny Boyle, but they were a different style of Zombie. Maybe Mr. Romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan, groan and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid, and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were re-animated. The people of \\\"Wheelsy\\\" just didn't have the proper motivation... they were horrible zombies.  So in the end I give \\\"Slither\\\" a 3, for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes.\", \"Slither is a horror comedy that doesn't really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other. It has one scene that is exceptionally good, any number of zingers that work, but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie. In addition, the script does not focus on the hero and heroine, and goes off kilter in several places.  A major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero (Fillion) to follow Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster. This whole part of the film drags - Michael Rooker's character isn't that interesting to us as a person, and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monster's interest might be interesting if this was Grant - Portrait of a Man Turning Into A Monster rather than a horror-comedy alien invasion movie. In the final analysis this movie's problems are in the script - it isn't that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates. The purpose of a horror-comedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them, with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens. Instead we get an exploration of the alien's habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag. The ostensible heroine (Elizabeth Banks as Starla Grant) is more central to this part, but nonetheless I felt the movie had left its narrative track, unless it planned on following Grant Grant all the way to the end.  When Fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook, but once again the problem is in the script. By this point that audience knows - and the characters should know - that Grant is not just suffering from some disease, and act accordingly (shotguns) - instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that \\\"let us get you to a hospital\\\" is going to help. Although their reactions might have been human and real, these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised - delivered action. A lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing.  *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** After the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack (a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie) the script once again betrays the movie. At this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien. The writer-director (Gunn) chooses as this character a completely new character, rather than one of already developed minor characters. Why? Why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot? By the time this character is attacked, we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her, even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath. Had Gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters, he could have completely avoided introducing her family, and saved time and money. Furthermore, the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the alien's plans without all the additional characters, and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigor.  My last criticism is based on the movie's look. Gunn is primarily a writer, or maybe it was budgetary constraints, but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting. Most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field, and the screen simply looks drab. The sets in Wheelsy (the fictional town where the action takes place) look cheap. The whole movie looks cheap. Box Office Mojo states the films' budget was $15 million, newspapers say $29 million, and considering they didn't use any name talent, I would say the money did not show up on screen. The monster is just repulsive, and rarely looks deadly.  The last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the character's actions. By the time Fillion and Co have begun hunting Grant/the alien, one woman has disappeared and Grant is known to have been mutilating animals. At this point I was expecting the FBI or at least the State Police to show up and take over from the hick Sheriff. A woman has disappeared and likely been murdered, and a local has been acting psychotic. Time to call the authorities. But basically I was hoping that would happen because I just wanted some characters who would show up and ACT.  Although this movie is ostensibly a horror-comedy, the movie it bears the most resemblance to is Dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions. Whereas Dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story (especially the entire Morgan Freeman subplot) and particularly the ending, in many ways it was stronger, primarily because the main characters were stronger, but more importantly because it looked beautiful. Although that may be anathema - preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values - that just shows you how uninteresting I found the look of Slither.\"], \"review_score\": [3, 3], \"review_category\": [\"neg_train\", \"neg_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 3.0}, \"Smokey and the Bandit\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0076729\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Smokin' Aces\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0475394\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Solaris\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0307479\", \"total_review_count\": 11, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"What the hell was THAT all about?

I would comment more on the movie but it wasn't really memorable.\", \"This comment is on behalf of everyone who has watched Soderbergh's \\\"Solaris\\\", didn't like it and were told they didn't like it because they haven't read the book or seen the original.  I have not read the book or seen the original, and I didn't like it. A movie, even one intended to provoke thought and debate, shouldn't rely on its basis for enjoyment. I had never read Clockwork Orange, a Batman comic or Ring, but I enjoyed all those movies a great deal.  It must be said that the ideologies presented in this film were immense. The notions of regret, second chances and fear of the unknown were skillfully put forward, especially the philosophy that a physical manifestation of an object or being, no matter how accurate, isn't necessarily the object it represents. Rheya questioning this and Chris' refusal to debate it due to his scientific values was the highlight. Unfortunately, outside of this scene, Solaris lacks anything. Character, progression and empathy. Chris is almost emotionless and this renders his character (a low point for Clooney) isolated from empathy. There is no spark between him and the audience. Rheya is dull and undesirable, hence uncomfortable to watch for too long. There is no standout performance in Solaris. The idea of regret and second chance in a science fiction film (the deepest and most thought provoking genre) seems dangerously trivial in comparison to values in Bladerunner, 2001, Invasion of the Bodysnatchers among others. Overall, Solaris is a huge disappointment. There is no climax and the film is far too slow moving to incite any interest. The values and debates are terrific, it is just a shame that there isn't a great narrative or performance to go with them.\", \"I'm not sure why I was asked to watch this film, but I don't think I will ever watch it again. At least, one can always hope. It was recommended to me by a young man who freely admits he could not stand it despite his love for George Clooney.  We have George Clooney as a psychologist who must go into space to examine members a of a space crew orbiting the planet of Solaris. Most of the crew is dead and then his dead wife appears. The remainder of the film seems to revolve around flashbacks of his wife, which are boring and seem to go nowhere. A great actor like Clooney and with the creative genius of Steven Soderbergh? How do we get this level of horse apples? I also want to mention George Clooney's tush. Because this film has the tush roughly three times. And while I respect Clooney for adding to the realism, I'm very sorry for the Clooney admirers who have to sit through this just to see a firm, shaved tush.  But seriously, I should have known this film was a dud as soon as Corey Feldman showed up. In his first scene, he's listening to Insane Clown Posse (Because obviously in the future everyone loves rapping clowns). And throughout the film, he acts like a lunatic with wild gestures. It looks exactly like David Duchovny's impression of Jeff Goldblum from Saturday Night Live's \\\"Celebrity Jeopardy\\\". Only in this film, Feldman is supposed to be serious.  If you want to watch this film, promise to let me know how you liked it because I would rather not have suffered alone.  (You should also be aware this film a is a remake of an older film with much higher ratings.)\", \"I just came back from \\\"Solaris\\\" and I really don't know what to think of it. I knew nothing about it beforehand, but I was expecting it to be a run-of-the-mill sci-fi film. Well, \\\"Solaris\\\" is definitely not a typical sci-fi, which is good, but mostly bad. It's a love it or hate it movie. I love films that mess with your mind, but this was too much for me. The total absence of action was fine with me, but people looking for thrills and chills will have to do with multiple butt shots of Clooney's posterior.   Of all the movies I've seen in a theater, I've never been so emotionless before. Not once did I close my eyes in fear, laugh, or express any other emotions. All 20-some people in the theater were like zombies, or maybe they were just asleep. When I left the theater, I felt like I'd just come out of a coma. Watching this movie is more like watching a painting come to life, I don't know how else to say it. The visuals are gorgeous and the acting was quite good, but the story is a mess. Even the most intelligent moviegoers will probably walk out feeling stupid for not knowing what was going on. Unlike other movies of this nature, seeing it multiple times probably won't help you understand it.  The story begins right away and draws you in, but you probably won't have a clue what's going on until a half hour in. By the end, I still didn't know much of the plot, but I didn't walk away completely empty. It was a surreal experience that is somewhat rewarding, yet it was a total head trip. George Clooney plays a psychologist or scientist (not clarified) that has been summoned to check out the strange phenomena happening in Solaris, a world in space. He is soon greeted by his deceased wife and finds out the two remaining crew members also have \\\"visitors\\\" that are dead. I'm going to stop there because if I go on, I'll blow the whole plot. The plot is pretty thin, so the action moves at a snail's pace to make this short story into a 90-minute film. If you can make it through this movie, you can make it through any movie. On an artistic scale, I'd give it a 8/10, but entertainment-wise, I'll give it a 2.\", \"Some Scifi movies are classics. Some are Legends. This one just doesn't fit in anywhere. It tries so hard to be 2001 A Space Oddysey and falls so short its not funny.  Its so difficult to follow a few of us thought at one stage that the player was skipping to other parts on the disk. It makes no sense whatsoever and if it moved any slower....  I will give the film its due in that it is trying to be an arty scifi movie with more flair than pure scifi.But still, something thats that hard to follow just cant be appealing.  If you're a classic Scifi lover of action, aliens and at least some kind of story - then I would give this one a skip.\", \"I did not walk into the movie theater with very high hopes for this film as Andrei Tarkovsky's version of Stanislaw Lem's 1961 novel \\\"Solyaris\\\" is one of my all-time favorite films. However, I was not prepared for how incredibly banal Soderbergh's version turned out to be. This film is, quite frankly, a BOMB.  There is little to say other than the fact that despite Soderbergh's first-rate craftsmanship, as a director, he lacks power; he is not of the first-rank of cinema artists, not matter how much he strives to be. He is not even in Spielberg's class of being an uber-technician/craftsman as at least Speilberg, even at his most banal, can deliver the goods. The new \\\"Solaris\\\" IS BORING.  The film is a terrible misfire. Focusing on the relationship of Kelvin and his \\\"wife\\\" to all else saps the film of the power of Tarkovsky's classic, which I always characterized as a more intellectual \\\"2001.\\\" This film lacks the philosophical power of the Tarkovsky film. In sum, Soderberg's version of \\\"Solaris\\\" is relentlessly SHALLOW.  Clooney is not appropriately cast, and his lack of acting chops robs the audience of identification as there is no character development that a fine actor like Kevin Spacey could give this role. Clooney's performance never really develops, his character never really changes; Kelvin, as played by Clooney, is a depressed wimp at the beginning and throughout the film. It's strange to see an actor as macho as Clooney playing a character on the border of hysteria. It might have made sense if we watched the character deteriorate, but as it was played, the character is poorly realized.  As for the other actors, Natasha McElhone is better than she was in FearDot.Com, and this is NOT like saying Pauley Shore was better in SON-IN-LAW than he was in BIO-DOME; she's not only beautiful, but gives a decent performance; however, what she lacks is star power, the charisma that a star like Julia Roberts can bring to a picture, thus making Kelvin's yearning and his ultimate decision more real. McElhone just isn't up to the demands of the role as realized in this film (as opposed to Tarkovsky's \\\"Solyaris,\\\" where the character is not quite as prominent). She lacks weight. While I don't think it's her fault as much as the director's, many times she struck me as having been teleported in from a shampoo commercial. She is just there to look pretty in some interminable sequences that scream \\\"STUDENT FILM.\\\" I guess this is Soderbergh's way of reclaiming his \\\"art house\\\" roots, but frankly, it's ridiculous, as is some of the dialogue, which is just plain bad, not even bad enough to border on camp (and thus give the audience some pleasure).  Jeremy Davies, who was so excellent in PRIVATE RYAN, quickly is solidifying his reputation as the worst actor on celluloid. Here, he channels the spirit of Travis Bickle, but Mr. Davies, you are no Robert DeNiro. It's becoming excruciating watching Davies in any movie; each movie, he is actually getting worse.  On an upbeat note, Viola Davis was good.  I voted this film a \\\"2\\\" (as the production design is excellent, as is the soundtrack), but is really is a BOMB.  Beware a Michaelangelo-inspired visual motif towards the end when Soderbergh really begins channeling the spirit of Stanley Kubrick.  Stephen, I knew Kubrick and you're not Kubrick, nor will you ever be.  The Web site for \\\"Solaris\\\" presents the film as being from two Academy Award winners, James Cameron and Soderbergh. Just remember: Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks and Martin Scorecese never won a Best Director Oscar; John G. Avildsen did. 'Nuff said.  \", \"Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, of course - but I am simply astonished that this film has received so many positive comments here. I have not read the novel on which the film is based and I have watched Tarkovsky's version twice (because it demands it), but by judging this 'Solaris' on its own merits, I think this version is simply a load of old plop. Here's why: this version concentrates almost entirely on the love story at its centre and to carry its ideas through successfully, the relationship at its core has to be believable - which it clearly isn't. There is simply no chemistry at all between the two leads; I've seen more sexual sparks created between Shaggy and Scooby. And whilst George Clooney is competent enough - he's certainly no Donatas Banionis. And the casting of Natasha McElhone is a complete disaster. Why that irritating smug grin throughout the film? A futile exercise in wasting everyone's time and money. Avoid.\", \"The original Solaris makes 2001 look like Sesame Street; unfortunately the remake makes Sesame Street look like the original Solaris. This is a great shame. I love the original. I hate the remake. It's an idiot's guide, everything has been boiled down and battered and chewed up so that a younger and less patient audience can easily digest it. If you wanted to remake Solaris as an episode of the Twilight Zone this is what you would boil the story down to. The original had a love story in it but it was not a love story.  And the original was a piece of cinema. It told its story in pictures. In the remake, once Kelvin arrives at Solaris, no one shuts up. There's a constant yammering explanation of what is going on. Everything has to be explained. It's the difference between 2001 and 2010. Sometimes mystery is better.  Forgetting the original, does it work as a stand alone movie? Again, it's not visual enough, you could do the script as it stands on the radio and no one would be lost. As for the acting? Clooney is Clooney, nice looking and can move about without bumping into the furniture, but there's always something missing from the man on screen: he lacks emotional weight. Natasha McElhone? Awful. The flashback scenes where she and Clooney are falling in love are an embarrassment. It's as though she's trying to break the world grinning record. Then she stops grinning and you know things can't be good. And as for Jeremy Davis? I think the man's been watching Dennis Hopper in Apocalypse Now once too often. A bad second-hand reminder of someone else's performance.  Plus points? The photography's nice. And it could have been longer, which might have made it a different and better film; but, given the film it has turned out to be, thank god it's as short as it is.\", \"One tag-line for this movie is \\\"There are some places man is not ready to go,\\\" like into the theatre playing this movie. The other tag-line is \\\"How far will you go for a second chance?\\\" Apparently as far as death by boredom.  This movie is about regret, consequences, and redemption. Regret for actually seeing it. Consequences, waste of an afternoon and money for the DVD rental. Redemption, none.  According to the director, Steven Soderbergh, the movie concentrates on the love George Clooney's character feels for his dead wife. And how far he will go to be with her again. But all he did was take 15-20 minutes of useful story, and stretched it into a 90 minute movie by adding on 70 minutes of useless garbage. Also, it seems as though he ignored the enigma of the living planet Solaris.  Where the whole story could have been made on an episode of the Outer Limits, only a part of the story was used into making a major snooze fest.\", \"I recently read the book Solaris from Stanislav Lem which was recommended to me by a friend. I read the book and I liked it. I liked it because of Lems very detailed description of the forms which Solaris creates and the accidents which happened there. I really must say that this 'scientific' descriptions of the happenings there were quite interesting and at some parts scaring. After I read the book I found out that there was a movie about this book and - because I really wanted to see those forms, the surface of Solaris and to compare them to those in my imagination - I watched it. But I the movie heavily disappointed me.  Only about 10% of this movie represent the book. The rest is absolutely different. Different characters, different names and different storyline. Sorry, but this movie should not be allowed to be called Solaris. Read the book if you want some Science-Fiction. Watch the movie if you want a twisted Romance.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Someone to Watch Over Me\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0094008\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Spider-Man\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0145487\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Stalag 17\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0046359\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Star Trek: Generations\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0111280\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0088170\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0092007\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Star Trek: Insurrection\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0120844\", \"total_review_count\": 5, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"Since this is a movie and not a TV episode with The Phantom Menace and Dark City to be compared to, Insurrection falls short. Still, it is not a mindless shoot em up which most sci-fi movies are these days, so overall I enjoyed it.  Like all Star Trek movies Insurrection has a convoluted plot that involves various \\\"pseudo scientific details\\\" and Star Trek concepts and in jokes. Meaning, it helps to have seen the TV shows to better understand what is going on. This is probably the main obstacle to why Star Trek movies have never been blockbusters.   Now about the plot. This may be a spoiler so, you have been warned. The basis of the film is greed and robbery. The Ba'ku who live on a beautiful planet are a defenseless culture who have something valuable, a special form of energy called metaphasic energy which reverses aging. The bad guys, the Son'a, want to kill the Ba'ku for it. The Federation proposes a forced evacuation of the Ba'ku so the Federation can share this valuable thing with the Son'a. Captain Picard insists on a compromise that would allow the Ba'ku to continue their life on their planet and for the Son'a and the Federation in cooperation with the Ba'ku to use the metaphasic energy of for an anti-aging treatment.  You might have been confused by that paragraph but being a Star Trek fan this was pretty routine. Insurrection is about a Star Trek idea called the \\\"prime directive\\\" which means the Federation is not supposed to interfere with the cultures of other planets. Is this interesting enough to be a good movie? It could have been if presented in a more clear and unusual way. Besides the complicated plot, the main problem with Insurrection is that the Ba'ku are pretty boring. They look like people from California living in a hippie commune. If you compare this to the planet Tatooine in Star Wars you can see that the Ba'ku planet could have been more exciting. Another problem is the typical love affair between the Star Trek captain and one of the cute aliens. A pretty worn out plot twist.  So, why did I like Insurrection? There was a lot of humor in the film that I enjoyed. The special effects were alright. But the main reason I thought Insurrection was fun was because I kept my expectations low (repeat after me, this is not Star Wars) and I was open to sci-fi that has some thought behind it.\", \"After the brilliant First Contact adventure we shared with the crew, we get this lame story involving the Enterprise. This seems like a bad episode that was stretched into full-length time. There are no surprises here, nothing worth noting. It lacked adventure and there was nothing to care about in the plot. What a disappointment! It makes you wonder how such brilliant writing can happen within the star trek series and movies like this fall short of one hour stories shown on the small screen. I saw this in the theatre only to find that I should have stayed home! It was a video release. I wish the executives would take chances with the plot lines, not be afraid to focus on action and drama. Have an all-out battle, have some detailed fight scenes or give us a look at the things that were only mentioned in the series. If you want box office like Alien, then act like it!\", \"The plotting in this film is beyond poor. How can the Enterprise drop the warp core yet still make it back in time to save Picard? Why does the ship need to fly over the collector to transport Picard back to safety? Why doesn't the holodeck simulate the collection after simulating the collection sequence? And the proliferation of hideous cliches ... the child running back into danger; the ram scoot (which was tired by the 40's); the fight sequence predictably ending in the stretching chair. The villains claim they don't want to co-inhabit the planet because \\\"it would take ten years\\\" to feel the effects, yet the Enterprise crew are significantly affected within hours! And I haven't even mentioned the joystick yet...\", \"I won't speculate on how so many weak and irritating ideas ever made it into this movie. However, Paramount are in really bad shape if no-one there has the power to say STOP even when presented with this load of rubbish.  By far the biggest irritant is that the alleged \\\"good guys\\\" are actually some of the most hateful people ever filmed. While these people, known as Baku, have been leading drippy and unproductive lives for centuries their own children have been banished to grow old and infirm on another planet. When these now technologically advanced \\\"Sona\\\" return, close to death, in an attempt to benefit from their home planet's natural regenerative radiation, the Baku hoodwink Picard and his crew into thinking that they are infact the victims. This is mainly because the Baku, basking in regenerative radiation all day long, have remained relatively pretty while the Sona are now very ugly as the film takes pains to point out.   It's been thankfully a long time since I have seen a totally white cast in a film, but black people are conspicuous by there absence from the Baku.   Additionally Picard takes up with a Baku who has spent her last 300 odd years learning how to look like a pouting airhead even when tons of rubble are falling on her head, yet cannot row a boat or swim when she needs to. This even though she lived next to a lake all that time!  Goodness knows what sort of point Jonathan Frakes is trying to make with this film.  I would recommend that anyone considering watching this film does so on DVD/video with the remote control never far away from their grasp. After you've spinned through:  1. Riker and Troi behaving like the first couple in school who find out how to kiss  2. Picard and a woman with a charisma by-pass talking about nothing for minute after nauseating minute  3. Blond kids rolling around in haystacks  , there really is only about 45 mins left of F. Murray Abraham (the baddie) and spaceships.  1 out of 10 and such an utter disappointment after First Contact which was a fantastic film.\", \"*Insurrection* quickly plummets into a boring and predictable storyline, with some obligatory special effects sequences thrown in to alleviate the pain. The script for this film needed some more time on the drawing board; nobody I know could understand what was really so bad about what the Federation was planning to do. Relocate 600 vegan yuppies to provide increased lifespans for billions of people?--come on, already--violate the prime directive!! Some of the special effects are spectacular, but others are generic, especially the Tron-ish deployment ship. In a move that's sure to warrant comparisons to *Star Trek V,* the writers go for a lighter tone in this film, throwing in way too many jokes, and even the standard Worf-gets-up-and-bumps-his-head, ha-ha-ha scene. I really had hoped to be more positive about this film, but near the middle it becomes a morass of extremely screwed-up psychobabble and moral analysis, with one very disgusting murder scene thrown in just to assure you the badguy is really bad.

I know i know, everyone calm down, I've got my reason. 1. The movie never adhered to any style/color. The first crow dealt with the color black. The film was very dark. City of angels had the yellow color to it. Salvation kept jumping around like it couldn't decide. 2. It almost seemed that the main character, alex, didn't have a personality of his own. Look, in the crow, brandon cared about his lost love and would go to any lengths to be back with her. In the second one vincent played the crow as insane, like he'd lost his mind. I didn't really get any feel towards the character of alex. 3. Some of the lines were just down right HORRIBLE. The original didn't have any super cheesy lines, the second one was more comic booky so it was alright, this one just let them go. Overall, the worst, i think the one (if they keep the title) with DMX will end up being better than this.\", \"I've been waiting for the moment when I'd finally see the third installment of the Crow saga. The moment came last night; and I must say that it might not be he best movie ever, but it was worth the waiting and the time spent in seeing it. I felt I was back into the dark, windy world to which the crow brings those troubled souls to \\\"put wrong things right\\\".  Another thing I'd like to comment is that (and kill me if you want, How do you kill someone who's already dead) I actually liked the Crow:City of Angels, and that I found this movie not better than its predecessor but different. It has a different mood, a different tone and a different feeling. This one has more action but is not as violent. And again, Eric mabius is not a better crow than Vincent Perez, it is just different. His character is more direct and he is not afraid to kill innocent people for his purpose, as opposite of the other two.  Scars instead of paint, and the poetic quotations are missing, I liked that, that makes the motivation of the character more visceral and organic and painful; a way to drag his sacrifice as a reminder. And of course, a guy who's here for a purpose and won't leave until it's finished. If something like that would happen to me, I would definitely do the same thing, and that's why the crow appeals to much to me and it always will.\", \"As far as Crow movies go, this one kicked butt. It was also one of the best movies I have seen in a while. It's a shame that it never really had the publicity it deserved (I'm not even sure if it was even shown in our local movie theatre). Although it seemed to have a slow beginning, things really picked up. In the tradition of the prior two movies, it was just loaded with action, where the newest incarnation (or avatar) fought his way through thick and thin to right the wrongs placed upon him, his girlfriend and her sister.  Overall, I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 stars.\", \"Though slightly better than its predecessor (CROW: CITY OF ANGELS), this one follows Crow numero dos by ripping off the scenario of the superior original film rather than acting as a sequel.  Some decent acting, and the mood of melancholy keeps it afloat, but the extremely routine storyline is difficult for the viewer's emotions to overcome.  ** out of ****.\", \"This is one cool goth movie. It's better done than the first one, because the first one had to be sown together a la Frankenstein when the lead actor really did die. God bless his soul. It's also better because it recycles footage from the first two. This movie is one great leftist movie about recycling, the memories of a schoolbus, and anti-death penalty. The end is hilarious. Let me just say that someone had a fetiche for female facial hair in this movie. It's also cruel to a step beyond the first two--Brandon Lee grieved, Vincent Perez went masochist, but William Atherton smiles like a killer clown. You can disagree with me and say the whole budget went to an illogically cool explosion and a trip to vegas for everyone, or ignore the crow's original bad acting--he's got a smirk on his face when he walks back in his cell, and take a trip downtown with the crow, way downtown.\", \"If you liked the first two Crow movies, you will not like this. It does not follow the true \\\"Crow formula\\\".  The true power which was contained in the Crow is totally violated.   Very disappointed.\", \"Another sequel to the crow franchise. i absolutely adored the first film. its a stunning film which set the standard very high for anyone to do better. since that film there has been nothing better. Its original sequel (the Crow: city of angels) was an incredibly poor film. I have seen much worse films but that came close to being one of the worst. Its third outing however (the Crow: Salvation) i enjoyed. Along with having a relatively original story (but keeping it strongly to the original) it has a strong acting cast who portray each character well. IF your a fan of the crow series its worth seeing each film. If you watch the films in order you can truly see how much better the third installment is.i give it 7/10\", \"This movie is better than the second Crow movie, City of Angels but this movie, like COA, could never equal the deeply moving love story of the original with Brandon Lee, nor the magnificent actor that Brandon Lee was. The Salvation lacked any real emotion. The acting wasn't too bad but the dialogue was delivered with an unreal quality like it had been badly rehearsed. The violence was gory, unlike the original Crow movie. The sensitivity was not there, and the scenes, including the background was not made to look real and looked like it was all done on the set. The original Crow movie had me in tears at the end because the love story was so touching; The Salvation had me shrugging my shoulders wondering why I even bothered to buy the movie.\", \"I would say that this is a way better improvement from The Crow: City of Angels. This film went for another direction. They used different music this time, a new theme. The setting is taken someplace else and the elements felt like it was from the first Crow movie. I'm not gonna say this is better than The Crow cause you can't beat the Brandon Lee classic. But this is right behind it. I thought the action was better than the second film. The love story is moving. I just wish that this Crow film was in theaters and not direct to video. Cause the cast in this film was pretty good. I'd give it a 8 out of 10. The Crow is a 10 out of 10 for me. The Crow: City of Angels was a 6.5 out of 10 for me.  RavingHulk\", \"As I am a huge fan of the original I couldn't help but judge this sequel on it and so I probably don't see it as 'fresh' as other views but even so I still found it weak viewing. From start to finish, events were rushed and meaning was scraped over with unnecessary gore \\u0096 and pore gore at that. The scenes were badly cut, the score was diabolical and the script was just pathetic. There simply was no deep meaning in this film, it seems they spent so much time perfecting the CGI effects, stunts and constant similarities to the first film that they forgot the plot \\u0096 the actual purpose of the crow. My advice to anyone considering seeing this movie is don't. If you still insist on watching the film and are a fan of the original, expect to be disappointed.\", \"Firstly, I'll say this: The Crow: Salvation is far from a low-budget knock-off sequel. Most second sequels are restricted by tiny budgets, meaning tiny no-name stars. The fact that they managed to get Kirsten 'Mary Jane' Dunst on board will tell you what kind of budget they're working with here, a pretty decent one.  Secondly, why does everyone hate the Crow sequels so much? Okay granted they're pretty straight reruns of the first movie with different casts, but they look and feel great, and the overall standard of material is pretty high. Plus, I may be blaspheming here, but strip away the veneer of Hollywood Gothic and high-concept production design, and all the original movie really constitutes is an Arnie style revenge flick. Which is quality, I might add, and the next two were exactly the same.  Bottom line with this movie is this: Eric Mabius makes an enthralling third crow, yeah Kirsten Dunst is pretty and all but she misses as much as she hits acting wise and the director knew this so she doesn't spend too much time overdoing the comic book heroine thing. The plot is good, and likeably macabre, so what's the damn problem?   Watch this movie with an open mind and don't think too hard about the original (or do and remember the plot was paper-thin and the characters were really cartoony) and you'll have a blast, okay?\", \"The Crow Salvation is a film that was personally in my opinion and I am sure, many others opinions, a step up from The Crow: City Of Angels. It's true, in most respects, it is.  Unfortunately, this movie doesn't quite focus on the poetry and melancholic views that the first one showed and maybe the second one showed as well. Though it is somewhat an original story in terms of the twists, and how Alex Corvis is executed for murder and is set out to find the killer(s). Almost like Poetic Justice.  This movie more focuses on the action of the movie instead of the sadness involved, but in most respects as said earlier, it is a step up. You might consider this to be a movie that is more appealed to a more teen audience.  Eric Mabius makes a really good Crow, though he is sort of a more \\\"anti-hero\\\" filled with rage in this movie instead of a good guy. Unfortunately, his look as the crow isn't exactly cool, instead, he looks kind of gross. This movie also isn't as dark as the first two were.  Kirsten Dunst's performance was terrible. I think she makes a better child actress than an adult/teen actress.  Jodi Lynn O'Keefe's performance was awesome, and she is so beautiful. In a way she has a little bit of resemblance to Shelly in the first Crow.  Still, I'll recommend this one anyway even if it doesn't make up to the first crow, but it does make up to the second one.\", \"The Crow: Salvation tries to make a name for itself by trying something new in the series. Not only is it about revenge and love, but the film incorporates a mystery element, bringing much-needed freshness to the franchise. I liked it! Story: Salvation begins at Alex Crovis' execution. Alex had been convicted of murdering his love, Lauren. Obviously, Alex is innocent, and the real killer is at large. After being executed, Alex is brought back to life and guided by a crow to seek vengeance. With the help of Lauren's sister, Erin, Alex tries to figure out why he was set up, and why his love was killed. Alex soon uncovers a conspiracy and a bunch of corrupt cops. Let the vengeance begin! Directing: Personally, I didn't like Bharat Nalluri's directing style. The way he shot things seemed way to T.V. movie-ish. There's a lot of close-ups, and tight spaces in the film. All of the scenes are evenly lit, and don't differ much from each other. There is an occasional nice shot, however, such as a scene with Alex walking down an alley towards the screen, with it snowing. Nalluri was alright, I suppose, but nothing special.  Acting: Eric Mabius(Alex Corvis) brought a totally different feel to the role. He has a definite liveliness about him that I liked. However, I wish he would have drawn me in more during the emotional scenes. I was very disappointed with Kirsten Dunst, who acted very amateurish in this film. It was like she hardly knew what to do with her part. What's the deal? Fred Ward(The Captian) did a fine job as the villain in the picture, and did no wrong that I could see.  Score: Marco Beltrami did an outstanding job scoring the film. The music has never been a problem in the Crow series. Beltrami takes a slightly different tone as far as the music, but still stays true to Revelle's Gothic roots.  Violence: The violence is prevalent, and quite bloody. Shootings, stabbings, impalings, even a severed arm. However, although graphic, the blood is a really bright red, and has a definite fake look to it.  Profanity/Sexual Themes: As with the other two, the f-bomb is used throughout the film. There is also a fair amount of female nudity, as one of the settings is a strip club.  Substance Abuse: No drug use going on, and I don't recall alcohol abuse either.  Overall: The Crow: Salvation is a good attempt to take the series in a slightly different direction. I think given a different director, the film really would have shined. It's still enjoyable, however, the mystery subplot did seem to take away from the love story a bit. A good action flick a fair bit better than City of Angels, and worth a look. 8.5/10\", \"This movie is definitely not for the girls.   No hot guys, while there are plenty good looking girls, most of all are the \\\"slutty\\\" type, and there a few scenes in a strip club, so there's lots of female nudity and stripping, which they also added in unappropriate parts of the movie. Not good.   And unlike the first movie, this one has no feelings.   I didn't find the acting very good, I feel Kirsten Dunst doesn't belong in a film like this, she was whiney and annoying most of the time. The character Alex wasn't a very good actor either, he had nothing that appealed to me.   It was hard to understand this film because of so many characters, I had to rewind in a few parts to understand.  Overall: 3 out of 10 I didn't enjoy it at all, but maybe you would.\", \"I bought this movie after enjoying the first two, and knowing that the movies would have nothing in common. While watching the film, I took note of a few things, these were: The acting was very poor and would have been better if performed by monkeys, the lighting was so dark that you could barely see anything correctly, the audio track was so quite that you could barely understand the actors, and it lost all meaning of the story rather quickly.  The only good part of the movie, was the end. I was sorely disappointed and only keep in around as a place filler in my DVD rack. Seriously, Barney the Purple Dinosaur strikes as better entertainment.\", \"This film was a BIG mistake. After the first 2 movies, the fans of \\\"The Crow\\\" saga made enough money to put this and the second terrible sequel together. This movie has nothing to do with the originally, brilliant cult movie with Brandon Lee. The story and the actors are so boring and useless that I had to laugh when I saw this crap. The makers they put this together are blind? I don't know who is this director phenomena, but I think he never saw anything about James O Barrs' comic or the first movie. The actor with the name Eric Mobius and his story with the burning scars on his face as a mask are so-so silly. Just try it once, you'll see...\", \"Remember 'The Crow'? The brilliantly dark and visceral story about a man seeking vengance from beyond the grave? Remember how picturesque the gothic scenery was, how great the character's were, how badly you wanted to see things set right? Well keep on remembering, because you'll get NONE of that in this, the third installment of sequels that should've stopped before they began. I LOVED the first movie, amazing. The 2nd one stunk, but its still got a few points for cinematography. This third film takes the plot of the first film, bastardizes it, and tries to regurgitate it in this insanely stupid film. A weaker plot there is NOT! Not to mention the character's that all seem to be running around fulfilling the plot elements with almost no sense of motivation. horrible horrible horrible. Not even worth a watch because of Kirsten Dunst.\", \"Cool movie! One of my personal faves! It's the best Crow movie 'til now in my opinion. Eric Mabius looks great as the third Crow and Kirsten Dunst acts brilliantly as Lauren Randall's sister. The first part of the plot is pretty common (a guy being set up for his girlfriend's murder) but the next is typical Crow-Corvis(Mabius) comes back from the dead to revenge both deaths.  Though the blood doesn't look real.More ketchup, please!   There are lots of great special effects which make it great (the car chase scene where the car and the helicopter blow up).  The rest is cool...\", \"I absolutely hated this movie. I did like The Crow 2 in a strange sort of way. The first was good. This movie makes the second movie look like Schindlers List. The acting was terrible, especially by Eric Mabius, who is an embarrassment to the series. The \\\"action\\\" in this movie is horrible. Theres only 1 real action sequence, and its so stupid. And when you have a good actress like Kirsten Dunst reduced to a whiny female lead, it only makes it worse. I'd rank this in the top 10 worst films ever, only being beaten out by Superstar.\", \"I love this movie! I would do all caps but the comp wont let me. I love \\\"The Crow\\\" when I watched \\\"The Crow: Salvation\\\" I fell in love with it. You can ask any of my friend, I'm obsessed! The Crow: Salvation blew The Crow: City of Angels out of the water. No matter what any of you say. Alex Corvis (Eric Mabius) is so awesome! I love this movie! It says I have to use 10 lines which wont be hard. i love this movie. I love this movie. I love this movie. I love this movie. ((Girl screams when Alex's head hits widow.)) \\\"You're Up!\\\" Mwahahaha...I love that. I love all of Alex's quotes. I love all of Alex...Haha you can guess who i'm going as for Halloween. I hate it when people try to look like Alex or Ashe or Eric or Jimmy(any of the Crow's) They stink at looking like them. I know just to do...You will think that's Alex walking down the street. He's mine!  ~KioKo\", \"Look, I know this move came out in 2000, but I had never even heard of it until it ran last night on F/X at midnight. I cannot at all understand how anyone thinks this even compares to the first Crow movie, or even City of Angels(which was bad). First, in all honesty, any \\\"Crow\\\" movie that doesn't come out as a straight-up remake of the first one is going to get the same response. \\\"an unoriginal attempt to tell a new story by cloning the original movie\\\"  The Crow franchise seems to be the victim of it's own gigantic launch into the world of movies.   The original Crow had villains that had quirks that made them individuals, you remember them each on their own.  City of Angels....it really isn't fair for me to make comments about at this stage because, quiet honestly, it was so bad that I took nothing away from the theater. I cannot remember much about it other than \\\"Sarrah is grown up and moved to L.A.\\\" I only remember this because I didn't care for \\\"Sarrah\\\" in the first movie.  The Crow : Salvation... or as it should have been called, Desecration. A young couple in love, torn away from each other by death, at the hands of the bad guys. Young man returns from the dead with the help of the Crow to avenge the death of his beloved and his wrongful execution. He discovers who the bad guys are, bonds with a living person and enlists the aid of some he can trust that had been involved with the case before he was executed. He obtains \\\"justice\\\" against the villains, loses his power, and is ready to finally rest in peace only to be forced into a showdown with the true man behind everything, and rescue the girl he bonded with. I think I saw this in another movie...The Crow. The surprise in this movie is that Kirsten Dunst did this film, I am by no means a fan of hers, and \\\"Erin\\\" could have been just as easily \\\"Mary Jane\\\". Her status in the film industry is why I don't understand her choice to do this. Fred Ward I understand, this seems to be his cup of tea. The plot makes minor changes to the original film story, instead of a big shootout with a bunch of thugs and criminals in a warehouse, there is a big shoot out with crooked cops and their back-up. Instead of an intelligent but twisted mastermind pulling the strings, there is a not so intelligent but twisted mastermind(used loosely) pulling the strings. Both top men could have left their \\\"Crow\\\" to go back to the dead after he believes he has avenged his girl and himself, but decide to kidnap the one living person who has a tie to the \\\"Crow\\\". This in turn leads to the bad guy's undoing. The acting was bad, the cinematic bad, the effects very bad, their really want anything good about this film other than the credits rolling. when I saw this film, I really thought this film was made by the Sci-Fi channel. As BAD as this film is, I think anyone who is a fan of \\\"The Crow\\\" should see it. Like it or not, it is part of the \\\"Crow\\\" universe.  There was Highlander, good movie, which spawned 4 more movies, two TV series, and animated trips into the world of the Highlander. None of which came close to the originality or quality of the first film, and each new product punched a new hole into the original film.  The Keaton/Burton \\\"Batman\\\" was a good movie for it's time, but it spawned 3 more movies, each more forgettable than the last.  \\\"Salvation\\\" is to \\\"The Crow\\\" what \\\"Batman Forever\\\" is to \\\"Batman\\\", it's like the ugly step sister, you don't wanna see her, but sooner or later ....it's gonna happen.\", \"OK this isn't as good as The Crow: Wicked Prayer (2005) but better than The Crow (1994) some music tracks of this makes me wonder if I have gotten hold of a movie with the same music guy from Universal Soldier: The Return (1999) but take nothing else away from it These Crow Movies need a higher rating me watching them makes me wonder if this is THE GREATEST FILM FRANCHISE OF ALL TIME. yes you read that right I love these movies the only reason I haven't watched The Crow: City Of Angels (1996) is that I cannot find it no matter where I go this villain is one of those \\\"I want him to die\\\" villains I also had never ever heard of these actors (which they were very good) besides Kirsten Dunst which we all know from Spiderman (this movie is way better) now the plot is The third entry in 'The Crow' series follows Alex Corvis, who was framed for the murder of his girlfriend and is executed. he is then brought back from the dead by a crow when the legend says 'Love is stronger than death'. He returns to discover that a corrupt police force is behind her murder and for him to go after the killers, he must find out the mystery behind everything that happened. 10 years old and still a good movie  Rating: 9/10\", \"This movie was really terrible.I would only give it 2/10 but that's because The Crow 2 was even worse.The Crow's make-up job made him look like an extra in a Marilyn Manson music video.How anybody could find him intimidating is beyond me.  Kirsten Dunst acts well(and is hot)but what why she agreed to do this mess is beyond me.The movie is WAY to long and is edited very badly.The LOUD rock music over every action(if you can call them that)scene becomes annoying really fast.  Please,i beg you don't watch this.Not even on t.v.Ever.Don't encourage them.Don't make the same mistake i did-and i saw it in a theatre for free!\", \"For the third Crow outing, I was left feeling rather skeptical of watching this considering the disaster with City of Angels?   I actually purchased this film on DVD in May last year and regrettably passed on to a friend considering I wasn't going to watch this too often as much as the original.   This time around it seems to have learnt from the mistakes from the 2nd part by sticking very closely with the themes of the original.  Eric Mabius was a surprise indeed for the lead with Kirstin Dunst on hand in a supporting role. Parts of the film did lack in places but was still exceptional viewing nevertheless.   I wasn't too sure about the villainy, as I thought the police being behind the murderous cover-up of Alex Corvis's (Eric Mabius) girlfriend (played by Jodie-Lynn O'Keefe) was little cheesy not mention repetitive with the idea of the police being the bad guys.  Visually it does resemble the original a lot and thumbs up Eric Mabius as well as he does pay homage to Brandon Lee very well.  I thought Fed Ward wasn't as menacing as he appeared to be, but was decent attempt.  Not bad, but please tell Miramax/Dimension to stop panning out any further Crow sequels as they really should have learnt their lesson with the last outing.\", \"I think this movie wasn't even worthy of being a Crow movie. It simply didn't feel like one. The movie wasn't dark enough and I didn't feel the same vengeance from this character as I did with the first two films. There were a few things I liked, such as the image of the crow makeup burned into his face and the angel crying blood but I really didn't think that the acting was that great, the bad guys weren't bad enough, and the general feeling of a Crow film just wasn't there.\", \"What a complete travesty this film is. Everyone keeps saying they learned their lesson after City of Angels. Are you blind? This film rips off the original film even more than the first sequel! Would it kill them to give us something new? A female crow? Another time period? Something other than a young male out hunting thugs...  The acting in this film is horrid. The villains are paper thin. The same cliche bad-asses we've seen thousands of times. Remember the first movie where each villain was clearly distinct from the next? T-Bird, Tin-Tin, Skank, and Funboy are still vivid in my memory. I couldn't tell you the name of one of the clowns from this movie. Just more second rate goons working for some puppet master... overkill.   The film definetly looks straight to video quality. The direction is totally uninspired. A total rehash of the first two movies. The original Crow is one of my all time favorite movies and it's almost painful to see how low this series has gone.   For the record, I think this pile of garbage is worse than City of Angels. And for those of you totally hateful towards that film, read the screenplay that comes on the Special Edition DVD for a look at what that film was supposed to be before producer Jeff Most got his hands in it. That man has tainted something that was once great and refuses to let go. They've totally misread what made the first film so incredible. If there is a Crow IV, I'm not expecting a lot...\", \"No disrespect intended to the majority of Crow fans (I myself am one) who think that the first film and Brandon Lee's performance in it was unbeatable and way better than this film and Eric Mabius' performance. But I must disagree, and I'll also ask if all those Crow 1 / Brandon Lee fans would be so adamant that the first film and that actor were the best thing since sliced bread if Brandon hadn't tragically died at such young age. Truth is that I like The Crow : Salvation more than The Crow, and I find Eric Mabius to be a better actor and his character to be more charming than Brandon's personality. The fact that Brandon's character was half insane while Eric's was totally sane simply wasn't an advantage for Brandon. Not in my eyes, anyway. Don't get me wrong, I still like The Crow as a film and Brandon as an actor. They're what convinced me to see the two sequels, after all. But while Brandon Lee was definitely handsome, charming and a good martial artist, he just wasn't all that good an actor. I do believe that he had a very bright future ahead of him in Hollywood if his life hadn't been cut short, but it's the fact that he died at such a young age and before his career could've taken off that has given him such a legendary status among fans. On the other hand, I think that Mabius has all of Brandon's positive qualities (minus the great martial arts abilities, of course), and he's a good actor on top of that. That's what makes Salvation better than the original, even if Michael Wincott's villain in The Crow had a slightly better presence than Fred Ward's villain in Salvation. But everything about Salvation I loved \\u0096 the acting, the dialogue, the plot, the violence (the execution scene and the break-out from prison were particularly well-done, fun and brutal at the same time), the soundtrack, and most of all, Eric Mabius himself. This guy simply owns the screen when the camera's pointed at him. I don't know why Dunst's name appears first, but that's an annoyance I will happily look past. It's clear that Mabius is the star of this film. The way he talks is delicious, ****SPOILER**** and he has tons of heart and rage when he addresses his friends (Dunst when she claimed she wanted to die) and adversaries (every villain he toyed with before killing them) and strangers (the drug-using stripper at the club whose age he asked before freeing her). Dunst herself isn't bad. Not a bad actress in her own right, though I doubt that's why she's got so many male fans. Her best scene was when she had informed Mabius that it was her information that had led the bad cops to his figurative door before his arrest/execution. And at least her character isn't a total damsel in distress as, while Ward's chief villain snatched her twice, it wasn't really her fault. The first time was because Mabius' friend distracted her before losing his own life, and the second time was because her gun only had one bullet in it. And considering that Ward's character is an experienced cop and she's a young civilian, it makes sense that he'll have sharper reflexes than her. Which isn't to say that this film's perfect. For one thing, it could've easily been twice as long so as to give more of a background to the villains (something that all three Crow films lack), and it was never explained how Fred Ward's character actually knew of the event which allowed Mabius to return from the dead, or why he was so obsessed with mutilating his own arm. The other villains, made up of the five corrupt officers under his command and his blonde secretary/lover, are cookie-cutter antagonists who show up only to harm innocents and then be beaten by the hero. And while I've seen Dale Midkiff and Bruce McCarthy in other films and I know them to be decent actors, they just don't have anything to do here besides being typical 1-dimentional villains (ie, needlessly violent, remorseless, having no positive aspects at all to them and good only when dead). But those small drawbacks aren't enough to take away from the genius that is Salvation. After seeing it, I only wish to smack Paul Anderson over the head for not including a character like Mabius' Alex Corvis in his Resident Evil films. As good an actor as Mabius is, he was totally wasted in RE, and he wasn't present at all in the sequel (which is a good thing for his career). But I can only wonder how the first mediocre film and the crap-filled sequel could've been improved if Alex Corvis had been around to tear off zombie heads in those two RE films. Too bad we'll never find out. Either way. To summarize, I own this film on DVD, and am very glad for it. 9.5/10.\", \"I saw this movie at the Brussels International Filmfestival on closing day, and I have to say it didn't convince me. It definatly had a sense of style to it, but the storyline (if there was any) was utterly confusing and very hard to follow. Kirsten Dunst is completely wasted in a small and weepy role as the daughter of a corrupt officer, and Eric Mabius as the Crow has a great presence although his dialogue is quite appaling and clich\\u00e9d. The plot again evolves around the same subject as the previous two films. A guy is wrongfully accused of killing someone, but during his execution something goes wrong and somehow he is revived by a crow. From there on he goes on a quest to kill the men who killed him. So far so good, but from there on the movie rapidly goes downhill. Aside from some stylish action and a really great 'cop-nearly-abuses-young-girl scene', there is not much going on at all. 3/10\", \"A wrongfully executed man named Alex(Eric Mabius), resurrected from the dead by the crow, returns with a vengeance to find the man with a scar on his arm that killed his beloved Lauren(Jodi Lyn O'Keefe). To find that man, Alex will first seek out the four men who falsely accused him on the witness stand which led to his death via electric chair. The crow will guide him on his journey to finding those responsible. Erin(Kirsten Dunst), Lauren's sister, and Peter Walsh(Grant Shaud;was Alex's attorney)are Alex's only allies in the search for retribution. Soon dirty cops are unmasked leading straight to the Captain(Fred Ward)and even Erin and Lauren's own father, Nathan(William Atherton). I like this film and think the reason it turns out better than I expected is due to the heart of the picture..one man's will to find the one's responsible for the death of his love. There is some strong talent in the cast for a direct-to-video feature and the young leads of Mabius and Dunst{..not to mention Ward, Atherton, Midkiff, and Shaud}bring much to this film. The film's budget is exceedingly lower, but I felt it makes up for it in keeping the plot simple instead of overloading us with an overkill of sick visuals. Now, that's not to say it doesn't lack punch and edge. There are some very gruesome moments indeed and much flesh is displayed, but the levels are down exceedingly. Plus, this film doesn't make out the perversion as beautiful, but with a disdain towards those young ones exploited{example being when Alex confronts the young girl tied to a pole in the strip club owned by the dirty cops}. The film doesn't speak highly for the cops on the force under the Captain. The world of this film isn't Gothic like the other two but just as corrupt. While the other two felt like they were set in a much darker time and place, this film feels closer to our time in modern society. That might turn some away who like the dark, noirish vision of the first two. But, I do feel the heart of the story is still here and the element of man's link with the crow is quite present here.\", \"The Crow: Salvation (2000) is better than what I expected. Although the straight-to-video feel is apparent during the action scenes, Salvation is a really good sequel in the Crow series. Let me tell you, it's a lot better than City of Angels, which (in my opinion) just didn't capture the feel of the first Crow film. Anyway, the story this time around is this:  Lauren Randall (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) was brutally murdered by being raped and stabbed 53 times. Her boyfriend, Alex Corvis (Eric Mabius), is wrongfully accused and is sentenced to die by way of electrocution. Alex claimed that he was innocent, and that a man with strange markings on his arm is the real killer. Regardless, on Alex's twenty-first birthday, he is electrocuted. But due to lightning striking the prison, Alex receives more of a harsh death. It doesn't help that the man with the scar on his arm watched. The Crow brings Alex back from the dead to bring justice upon those who have killed Lauren and to find the scarred man. Since he was electrocuted, Alex's face is horribly burned. The men who did him wrong are Vincent Erlich (Dale Midkiff), Phillip Dutton (Bill Mondy), Stan Robbers (Walt Goggins), and Martin Toomey (Tim DeKay), all of whom are corrupted police officers. As Alex begins to kill the guilty, he proves his innocence to Lauren's sister Erin (Kirsten Dunst), who's deeply distraught over her sister's death. Erin's father Nathan (William Atherton) is also having trouble coping. As Alex is unleashing carnage upon the police officers, The Captain (Fred Ward) becomes extremely interested in Alex and the legendary Crow. Alex gets more than he bargained for, however, when his actions causes Erin to be in fatal danger.   The violence is of course bloody/gory, but this time it actually feels justified like the first time with Eric. Plus, it's always good to see police officers get theirs when death is knocking on the door. Alex uses his healing powers more often than his predecessors, either from the actual need to heal or just to be playful. A common occurrence in all three Crow movies seems to be that each hero is shot repeatedly by several people, which undoubtedly proves their short-lived immortality. Alex, unlike Ashe from the second film, has fun with his victims while he tortures/kills them. It's a better follow-up to the first film.  The acting was decent, but nothing mind-blowing. Eric Mabius seemed to have more fun doing the action scenes than the deep/heart-felt scenes (trust me, it shows). Kirsten Dunst, surprisingly, is both pretty and can act good. Everyone else isn't convincing in their roles. Sorry to make yet another comparison to the first film, but what made the first film stand-out is that the villains had depth and each one was unique. In both Crow sequels, the villains are introduced and then they face off with The Crow. Zero depth. Just all typical \\\"tough\\\" villains that try too hard to be considered evil/brutal.   While it's no masterpiece, Salvation pulls its weight and manages to be really good. Just skip over City of Angels and see this instead. Still, although it's not perfect, The Crow series is one of my personal favorite movie series. I can't wait to see what they do with the fourth one. I give The Crow: Salvation (2000) a 7 out of 10.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0970416\", \"total_review_count\": 25, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"Bad effects, bad storyline, boring... i almost fell asleep. don't go to the cinema wait till its on TV and than go and do something else.

It is a waste of natures resources.I hope that they will not burn this on DVD. what else to say, the movie is slow.. starts slow en ends slow. it is predictable. i would say it is in the same genre as i legend. that was also a bad movie. nae .. seeing it in the cinema is a waist of time.better buy some flowers for your loved one. What else to say over this movie. sorry but 10 lines is way to much.\", \"I can't explain how disappointed i was after watching this \\\"thing\\\". Keanu Reeves (one of the best actors in present, and nearly always acting in great movies). And the great story, who was filmed so awesome in the fifty's. But what was that at least? I must had know, that this can't be a good movie from the director, who makes a horror classic like \\\"Hellraiser\\\" to a joke. He really missed every moment to make a good movie. No association with the characters. How bad the scene was as Klaatu decides to rescue the humankind... I feel nothing! And that's because of this \\\"16-year-old-talking-and-behavior\\\" child. Why? He showed us in \\\"The Pursuit of Happiness\\\" that you can feel with him. And this \\\"invasion\\\"...awful! The whole meaning gets lost... He could have been showing such impressive pictures of our planet to get a feeling for the complex of problems, who are so real in our days. But nothing! The spheres landing in the jungle, you only see it coming down to the ground...and that's it. The only animals you see are little snakes , frogs and other little creatures. No lion, no elephant, no animal you get impressed for, but that could have been so important to get a feeling for the movie. But maybe exactly this points who makes me sick are the special interpretation of Mr. Scott Derrickson. I unusual seen such a unmotivated and boring movie...\", \"When I first saw the 1952 version of the tale, I felt impressed. In the past, I have been successful avoiding updated versions of classic movies, just to save me from disappointments, but this time I felt like falling in.  I was prepared to see much more spectacularity in this 2008 version, the regular special effects, and maybe something new in the script.  And yes, there was some new things in the script. A rather inconsistent start, The Cold War is still there, plus the global warning, and maybe the toxic assets. There's also a reference to the altruism enigma.  The rest is purely crap.  We miss the evangelistic references of the 1952 version. There's no Jude and there's no mortality in Klaatu's enigmatic persona. Instead, he's a rather flat and expressionless superhero, able to control people's mind remotely or bring down helicopters with his hands. No thrill.  The rest of the cast ranges from stupid to useless characters. The kid is really hard to stand, and the Secretary Defense is unbelievable. Even the heroin looks little smart despite her academic titles, and there's this pain of watching John Cleese trying to act seriously.  But, over all, there you have this gigantic hole in the script. After almost destroying New York (yes, just recovered from the recent havoc of Watchmen!) and lots of stadiums, trucks and the like, Klattu surrenders to rather poor mortal mercy demands, and leaves the planet.  Probably then, Klaatu just forgot the movie's name, and sends a command to freeze the whole Earth machinery pool. But... Why does he need to demonstrate his strength with a global warning when he just almost destroyed the planet? Is like sending a newsreel with Los Alamos footage to Hiroshima the 9th of August, 1945. Purely crap. Nonsense crap.  Luckily, we still have the 1952 version.\", \"man, once again aliens want to destroy the earth ... have i mentioned how i hate this stereotype? they always travel huge distances to destroy us or our planet - we must be important ;)   this time they are doing it out of some silly ethical reasons - we are destroying the earth, so they will do it first - no comment so here some logical mistakes: - they take samples of the flora and fauna of the planet - does it mean the nano bugs will destroy everything? even the flora and fauna? if so - why can't they take the samples and let the earth be? if not - why do they need the samples? how far is their genetic engineering and their planet creation/rebuilding skill? nano bugs eating pollution for example? or creating more of endangered species, so they are not endangered anymore?   - from an ethical point of view the aliens are behaving quite unintelligent too - they have no responsibility whatsoever for either us, our planed or the life on it. they could provide us with better technology so we don't destroy the earth and can live in space if they feel some responsibility ... but this wouldn't be such an \\\"dramatic\\\" movie, would it.  - sending an ambassador out of the ship when it is surrounded by military is not intelligent at all, especially when he is not invincible. why isn't he wearing a nano-bug-armor? they have knowledge of the human body, but just didn't care to understand how we are thinking? - the ambassador initially wants to get to the UN, so they have studied us a bit after all (never mind not understanding our concept of military). but they seemingly have no idea that the UN is quite powerless - they should have attended one of the G8 summits instead. or summoned the big industry guys ... and why is it the ambassador has always to go to the USA - there is a UN headquarter in Vienna.  - the idea of sending an ambassador vs sending their message on all TV channels and thus reaching all people without even landing and causing this panic ... what do you thing is better?   some other points:   - they have studied us for a while, decided to destroy us and suddenly change their mind because of what? i really couldn't understand why they would stop? do they believe we will change? do you? i think not without the giving us some technology.  - the alien ambassador just looks at some formulas on a black board and knows what it is and why it is wrong ... i study informatics and have a lot of math - you just can't know all the formulas and even if you do you won't always recognize them, since there are different ways to say the same.  so - bad script, the acting disappointed me too - no point in watching this one.\", \"An alien spacecraft lands in Central Park, and an alien emerges. After being wounded in an attack by the U.S. military, the human-like Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) appears when being nursed back to health and hints at the potential destruction of Earth. He manages to escape government officers, and ends up in the care of scientist Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly). Along with her adopted son Jacob (Jaden Smith), the group attempts to try and stop the impending destruction, while the government chases after them.  Buried very deep into the core of The Day the Earth Stood Still is some semblance of a great movie. But its outer shell is anything but.  The plot may sound interesting, but after Klaatu makes it clear what his purpose is, the movie becomes a downgraded half-assed chase movie that is more boring than it is thrilling. And by the time the ending comes around, the film and everything about it is utterly forgettable. Humanity appears to be at stake, but none of the characters seem to really care about their survival. It just seems so standard to them, so tactic. Characters are done away with like they are nothing (whether by dying or just not appearing again), and other characters appear with not even the slightest hint of motivation. How are we supposed to leach on to anyone when no one is even remotely likable? The closest we get to a three-dimensional character is Reeves' Klaatu, and he speaks in such riddles and convoluted language that he may as well not be speaking English.  Do not get me wrong: The Day the Earth Stood Still is loaded with a goldmine of ideas. But they are all treated as mere inconveniences to the bigger \\\"plot\\\" the film struggles with. The filmmakers seem to have very little idea of what they want to do with the picture. It seems to want to send a message, but it does not know how to. It jumps from idea to idea (and even though to thought), hoping to grip onto something that sticks. But nothing does. It is merely written over, waiting for the next idea to spark and be done away with. Even the special effect showpieces are carelessly done. Sure, there are some great effects, but ultimately, there is nothing too spectacular on display here.  It is not clear where the fault for this silly and ultimately unneeded film lies. Do we blame screenwriter David Scarpa for not knowing whether he should homage the original work, steal from multiple films that have come since, or create his own original idea? Or do we look to director Scott Derrickson and the creative team for having culled together the shots and sequences for the film, and then not knowing how to make some sort of good movie out of it? If they do not care, then why should we?   The acting is poor across the board. Connelly, an Oscar-winner, should have known better than to touch this film. She looks stunted and confused in every one of her scenes. I imagine she tried to make something of this awful role, but you would never even guess with the footage that exists in the film. Smith, while playing to his age, seems to be aping his father a little too much. He wants to be spunky, but he wants to try to act method at the same time. With a little more work, he could probably match Will's best work from the mid-1990s, but if he keeps this up, he is destined to become a laughing stock that will annoy audiences. Jon Hamm and Kyle Chandler are given such a small amount of work to do that one must wonder why the filmmakers went with recognizable faces in their roles, while John Cleese and James Hong have such short scenes that you may blink and miss them altogether. Kathy Bates genuinely tries to make something of her juicy role, but it is downplayed far too much.  Reeves however, delivers another classic Reeves performance. This role was practically tailored for him to play. He spends most of his time on-screen giving baffled and bizarre looks at the camera, or delivering the stilted dialogue we have come to know him for. He gets no real time to emote in the role, and gets even less time to explain himself. But Reeves is a master of this stoned out technique, and is on his own playing field against the rest of the cast. He has done far greater work (The Matrix trilogy obviously, and my personal guilty pleasure, Speed), but because this role does not ask much of him by way of actual emotion, he soars through as the single best thing about the movie. And yes, I am quite terrified alluding to that idea.  Calling The Day the Earth Stood Still disappointing is a bit of a stretch. Calling it awful is a lot better of a description. While the plot sounds like it could make for some interesting science-fiction (especially based off its legendary source material), the film falters and fails too many times to really make anything of itself. There are some great ideas sprinkled throughout the movie, but nothing is ever done with them. They are either brushed away, or outright ignored. Whether it is the boring storyline, the bad acting, the horrendous dialogue, the erratic tonal shifts, or the very inconsistent CGI, the film just has no chance to even attempt to work. And as a movie with a message, it fizzles more often than it sizzles. It has the ideas to go the distance, but lacks the motivation.  3/10.\", \"Hollywood has been remaking a lot of movies lately with usually terrible results, and this is no exception. The scriptwriter has taken the original script, and rewrote it while apparently stoned or on coke. The original movie has an extremely clear storyline with no idiotic story twists, no decidedly crazy and astronomically improbable behavior like this one has in spades, and is excellent from first moment to last.   This piece of sputum on the other hand will let you feel like you want to bash the characters heads in half of the time for being so stupid and outrageously insane. The most pathetic part of this movie is the fact that despite having state of the art special effects it can't hold a candle to the original, which had hardly any effects whatsoever, never mind special ones.  True, it is not completely abysmal like , say , the day after tomorrow, and has at times decent acting. But good actors like John Cleese for instance are completely wasted in this movie, and even Reeves and Connely perform like wooden dolls at times. I won't spoil the end to you; I don't need to, it is bad enough that it will spoil itself.  Script: Zero .. Done by a chimp and two stray dogs taken from the streets. Edmund North is rolling in his grave.  Acting: far below average most of the time, sometimes OK   Music: Music? What music?   Effects: Made irrelevant by sheer lack of everything else...   Directing: I would be ashamed to be affiliated with this movie, even as a janitor. In fact, I would be ashamed been seen holding the DVD at a rental.\", \"Oh boy, where to begin on this one... I won't go into the plot or story, because it's non-existent. It's a 100 train wreck that sometimes tries to be a sci-fi film, but attempts to insert some action and CGI money shots. It fails miserably, being a Michael-Bay-esquire version of what a sch fi movie is supposed to be.  Keanu's acting speaks for himself, he is pretty much playing the same character as he did over the past 15 years (post-Speed Keanu). Kathy Bates is wasted on this one, and she FEELS she's on the wrong place, you can see it right through her acting. John Cleese appears on the cameo that shows how DEAD his career is. From Python to this, it's so SAD to witness his scenes...  Of course, we have Jaden Smith, at yet another ANNOYING scenery chewing piece of child performance, that makes you roll your eyes in disbelief. You can just FEEL his dad right next to the camera, paying off the director to keep him in this film.  Filled with plot holes and an anti-climatic Deus Ex Machina, the classic 1951 film is murdered on this 2008 travesty, a sign of how awful Hollywood has turned. I cannot stress this too much: avoid.\", \"This movie is a victim of its own hype and clever editing on the trailers. There are several reasons why this movie doesn't work, although it did have potential. The first reason: The Army isn't retarded. They are portrayed as cro-magnonesque, flying 2 Raptors in to fire on the GORT which ultimately fails, leaving someone whom we are assumed to be in command saying to an airplane hangar full of troops \\\"Anybody else got any ideas?\\\" Secondly, the military would be in charge, and there would be much more collusion between department heads then led to believe. Kathy Bates, who gave an average performance (probably not her fault, her script was bland) is the Secretary of State, and seemingly the Secretary of Earth, as none of the other world leaders are even involved. Instead of world leaders, we have Jennifer Connelly, an astrobiologist, calling the shots. It isn't really plausible that the US military would allow a civilian to be the first contact for alien visitors.  Acting was....OK. Jayden Smith needs a little work, but again his script was pretty poor, as is the editing with some cutaways with him and Klattu. Keanu was a pleasant surprise, as he looked and acted as stoic and un-feeling as possible, and did it well. Jennifer Connelly held her own, but wasn't fantastic.  The end of the movie is abrupt and anticlimactic. There seems to be a reason that this was released in the winter, as it didn't have the punch to be a summer action blockbuster. 4/10.\", \"I'm sure many millions were spent making this, but they really shouldn't have bothered.  The acting wasn't bad, with Keanu Reeves playing his role well enough. Similarly the CGI was okay, although nothing to be particularly proud of. Where this film is really let down is in the storyline and the dialogue. Its appalling.  This is clear right from the start, where leading scientists are gathered to do what appears to be nothing, except of course discuss the end of the world with limp scientific terminology. However, this is nothing compared to the end, and frankly the less said the better, which ironically seemed to be the director's view as well. The fact we are supposed to accept that after planning to wipe out human kind for many years, one alien changes his mind after seeing an upset child and step-mum, is absurd! This film is poor and predictable, and certainly not worth a second look.\", \"I loved Robert Wise's original film, so this remake was a big disappointment. This is the type of movie that gives Hollywood blockbusters a bad name. The filmmakers have taken a well loved film and produced a travesty. For some reason the idiots behind the film decided that the story could be improved upon, unfortunately their changes make little sense.   When a spaceship lands in Central Park, an alien messenger called Klaatu (Keanu Reeves)disembarks. The rest of the universe is worried about the Earth's environmental record and Klaatu has been sent to tell us to clean up our act. He is shot and captured. Kathy Bates plays a Defense Secretary in the Cheney/Rumsfeld mold. She decides that the aliens need a demonstration of America's military prowess and decides to play hardball. The U.S. government wants to keep the alien locked up and his identity a secret. This does not go down well with Klaatu, who concludes that further discussion with the U.S. government is a waste of time and decides to exterminate mankind.  Jennifer Connelly plays a Princeton professor and government science expert who befriends Klaatu. In the original film Michael Rennie moved around DC and is gradually won over by Patricia Neal and the other ordinary people he meets. In this film he is shackled to Connelly and her young son. Reeves exhibits none of Rennie's easy charm and looks dazed and confused most of the time. The child playing Connelly's son overacts and is an annoying distraction. At the end of the film, Klaatu leaves the Earth telling only Connelly and Professor Barnhardt (John Cleese) about his mission, there is no speech to mankind and the film fizzles out.   The movie does have impressive special effects and perhaps if they had given the film the benefit of modern film technology and an updated look this remake may have been justified. Unfortunately an American classic has been vandalized, and you have to wonder what they were thinking.\", \"The days when Hollywood once turned out such classics as the l951 THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, are long gone. When we go to the multi-plex today, we're treated to endless, lousy remakes of Asian horror flicks, endless sequels (i.e., Saw, Alien, Terminator, Halloween, etc.) that squeeze every drop of magic from the original until there's only a dried up rind. This remake of The Day the Earth Stood STill, is a perfect, sorry example of what passes for movie sci-fi/fantasy in the year 2008. While the l951 original still fascinates with its powerful acting, script, production and that fabulous Bernard Hermann's musical score, this new take features a shockingly inept cast and grade-Z special effects.  We're treated to a zombie-like Keanu Reeves who shows the emotion of an oyster. His face and eyes never change expression. His voice sounds like a dead man. His fellow living corpse is Jennifer Connelly who acts as if she exists in a different universe with no connection to what's happening around her. Even worse, is the obnoxious, surly black kid, Jaden Smith (oh, yes, son of the mighty Will Smith) who is so repulsive you wish the giant robot Gort would zap him off the screen. It's as if the movie makers are so fanatically politically correct that they gave us a black child who is supposedly adopted by a white woman, Jennifer Connelly. They have no rapport, but then the child is so hostile, one can understand why. One of the key figures in the original was the young boy played by the wonderful child actor, Billy Gray. He was so genuinely sweet and likable that you really loved him. When he shows the alien the memorial graveside of countless dead military men and women, and then visited the Abraham Lincoln memorial, you were profoundly moved. When Jaden Smith does this in the remake, a glycyrine tear dribbles down his cheek ss he glares sullenly at the zombie-like Reaves. Wow, what a really down, hostile scene.  There's no sense of impending disaster and when the day finally comes for the Earth to stand still, a swarm of badly executed CGI bugs destroy Yankee Stadium and then stop. Keanu Reeves has obviously discovered that mankind isn't all evil. That's because the black kid and his mother have persuaded him that there is still good in the human race. If only, there was some good among movie makers, the type of goodness that would persuade them to give us some original, scary movie magic--like Alien, The Thing, The Terminator, halloween, etc.\", \"I'm a big fan of SciFi and as with many who love the genre, I considered the 1951 version a classic. So, I was quite anxious to see the remake. The obvious change in the primary point of the plot, (war/violence to environment/climate) seemed workable, and if properly executed, had potential.  As it turns out, it was potential unfulfilled. I left the theater thinking that was 2 hours of my life that I'd never get back.  Mediocre acting can sometimes be overcome by a really good story and script but no amount of great acting or special effects, which this film definitely did not contain, can overcome a lousy script.   SPOILERS FOLLOW   In the original the scenes of the Earth standing still occurred at a point in the story line that made sense in the flow of the story. The point was to demonstrate that the aliens did indeed have the ability to destroy the earth. In this version they choose to plug that event in at the end of the movie leaving viewers wondering why.   The change in the plot from advanced races sending a being to evaluate and warn us to changes our ways to one in which the decision to destroy humanity has already been made guts the point of the original story and makes this noting more than another \\\"B\\\" aliens come to destroy the Earth movie.   Finally, the acting in this bomb leaves much to be desired. Keanu Reeves was emotionless, as usual. Jennifer Connelly was almost as bad. Perhaps the most disappointing was Kathy Bates, who is usually a great actor, although I do not know that anyone could really do all that much with the flotsam of a script they were saddled with.   Bottom line is that this film is definitely not worth the cost or time and effort of a trip to the theater. If you must see it, do yourself a favor and wait for it to make it to the movie channels or show up in Red Box.\", \"First and foremost. I HAVE NOT SEEN THE ORIGINAL. So this is an unbiased review from a person who has not seen or thought about seeing the original.  Now. Lets begin. The Day the Earth Stood Still starts off well. It is pretty captivating and interesting. It hooks you and slowly but surely draws you in. For about the first thirty minutes I could not stop wondering what was going to happen next. The movie was moving slow but still holding my attention.  But after that thirty minute mark I realized that the movie was going nowhere. Literally nothing was happening. The entire hour and a half that followed consisted of nothing more than a car ride to the woods, a car ride to the city, some cheesy looking orbs spawning up out of the dirt, and some bugs that ate stuff. If you throw all those things together blend it up with a p1ss poor plot and about two cool CGI scenes (that are both in the commercial) then you have this movie.  And try as I might to figure out what was actually going on, nothing become apparent until about an hour and a half in when Keanu talks about saving the earth from humans. First you think he is a \\\"bad guy\\\", but then he says that hes going to save the world so you think he is a \\\"good guy\\\", but then he kills someone so you think hes a \\\"bad guy\\\" again. But then he revives him. At this point you basically are just thinking \\\"WTF? This movie sucks. I don't have a clue whether I should like Keanu or not. I have to go to the bathroom, and I am going to have a hard time convincing myself to return to the theater if I leave to pee.\\\"   The acting was okay. The only scene which I thought the acting was really good was the crying scene between Jennifer Connelly and Jaden Smith. It was done surprisingly well. Other than that the acting was decent at best. Evan Keanu didn't meet my expectations. His character was....flat.  The first thirty minutes of this movie had me expecting something good. The next hour and a half left me with a sour taste in my mouth, bored, and wishing I was watching a different movie.  The movie was simply boring. I understand that Sci-Fi doesn't always have to be explosive. But something has to happen. And in this case, nothing did.  Final Word: Boring.\", \"I am not one who is against remakes in principle, not even remakes of really good films. The Day the Earth Stood Still is, as far as I see it, a prime candidate for remake. It would be easy to update this story to comment on current times. Modern audiences, after all, are very little effected by the Cold War anymore. The makers of this new version do, in fact, attempt to relate their film to modern affairs. The alien visitor, instead of interfering over Earth's nuclear ambitions, comes to out planet in order to stop us from destroying our environment. That's a perfectly acceptable updating. Unfortunately, as is the problem with most remakes, The Day the Earth Stood Still '08 has the unmistakable aura of having been made for a quick buck. You remember there's a classic called this? Throw us a few bucks, and you won't have to sit through it in black and white anymore! And there'll be a couple explosions! It all feels so rushed and sloppily thrown together. Scenes contradict each other, little of the plot makes any sense. The visual effects are wildly uneven. Gort in particular is a computer generated monstrosity that looks like he's been imported straight from a Nintendo 64 game. Pretty much all of the actors don't seem to want to be there, and almost all of them give abysmal performances. We expect that from Keanu Reeves, but when Jennifer Connelly, who gives it her all even in junk like Hulk, phones it in, you should realize your project has little merit. The entire film is poorly paced and frequently stilted. It never works.\", \"Can one little kid ruin a movie?   Yup.  Think I'm exaggerating? Watch this film. You can see Exhibit A of it right here in this science-fiction \\\"classic\\\" film, a re-make of the 1950s hit movie of the same title. This re-make actually would have only \\\"bad\\\" without inserting this annoying kid, but he made it \\\"horrendous.\\\" Jaden Smith as \\\"Jacob Benson\\\" is a spoiled, chip-on-his-shoulder, disrespectful kid who incessantly talks back to his mother, who puts up with it - which is equally annoying for most audiences.   What was the purpose of inserting this kid in the film? What were the writers thinking? I'm glad to see a number of reviewers here agree with me on this one. I guess if you're the son of a famous actor (Will Smith), they'll insert you in film roles, even if there is no purpose to it. And Hollywood wonders why people don't go to the movies much any more, and they sneer at pitiful re-makes?   Meanwhile, Keanu Reeves was a good choice for his starring role: an emotionless robot-like alien. Reeves is such a wooden-sounding actor to begin with that playing a bland robot is good casting for him. \\\"Klaatu\\\" is tailor-made for him.  Comedy was provided via the ludicrous environmental fear-mongering message in here. I laughed out loud in several spots when \\\"Klaatu\\\" explained to us the reason for his mission. It's so stupid, it's laughable. I was reminded of Ed Wood's horrible sci-fi stories in the 1950s.  I will say some of the special-effects and the surround sound in here is excellent. It was the highlight of the movie. These are good visuals and good audio, and a nice film to view on Blu-Ray. Unfortunately, the story got in the way.\", \"Just saw the film. It was AWFUL! What a way to ruin a classic film. This version has NOTHING on the original.  Plot:  (Global Warming) WEAK! Beginning sequence disjointed and confusing! More holes in this story than swiss cheese! What did the opening sequence have to do with the story? Klaatu walks out of the \\\"Globe\\\" (where is the ship???) and just as the good Dr. is about to shake hands with him, he is promptly shot! He wasn't reaching for anything but a handshake the universal sign of 'hello'.  Klaatu is taken to makeshift hospital where we learn that he was walking in a 'placenta' suit one minute and then the next minute they are marveling about how he was 'just born'. ???   Later in the film he uses some of this 'placenta'material to bring back to life a cop he just KILLED. It grossed me out when he stuck his finger in the 'planceta' and then in the dead cop's mouth! Why did he bring the cop back, if he was on a mission to kill the entire human race?   Later we learned that the Globes were all over the planet, and they were the 'ARK' that was saving stuff to be used after the world was 'cleansed'. (They actually used the word CLEANSED in this context)   Acting:   Then there is the ACTING, (If you can call it that) The acting was DEPLORABLE! Probably the worse I have seen in any movie in the last 10 years!   Kathy Bates as Sec of Defense SILLY, OVER THE TOP, NOT BELIEVABLE. ( I kept looking for her to break somebody's ankles)  \\\"The One\\\" as Klaatu was just plain PITIFUL and PAINFUL to watch! He sleep walks thru almost the entire film. (Oh wait that is what Reeves calls 'acting')   Jennifer Connelly was terrible also. She was not believable as a Scientist nor as a mother! She never connected with Reeves or Jaden Smith on any level! (It may not have been her fault, I don't envy what she had to work with!!!)   Jaden, the Smith kid, What in the world made them think this kid could act! I looked for the credits to see if they were the producers on this film! I didn't see their name! How did this kid get the part! It didn't help that the part they wrote for him was as a spoiled brat who needed his butt\\u0085.. (I wish I would call an adult who is now my mother by her first name\\u0085.)   I would not even rent the DVD to see this movie, I am sorry I wasted $6.00 on it.  Save your money, The Day the Earth Stood Still was when I wasted an hour and 40 minutes of my time watching this crappy film!   Thank you \\\"HollowWood\\\" for messing up another Classic Film! \\\"No soup for you\\\"!\", \"So I was one of those people who was screaming no at The Day The Earth Stood Still remake, the original is one of my favorite movies. It's a terrific sci-fi film, probably the best to come out of the 50's era. I highly recommend it; moving onto the, sigh, remake. Keanu Reeves, mmmm, what on Earth about him scream alien? I guess since it looks like it hurts when his face expresses human emotion, he's what the director needed. But what I didn't appreciate about the remake is that it completely changed the story and the moral the first movie brought to us. If we were to have a remake of this story, at least it seems like in today's world it moral is more important than ever, that humans are just destroying themselves with all the technology and violence that we have created. Instead, I get 2 hours of Jennifer Connelly complaining to a stubborn Keanu Reeves on how much humans rock.  Dr. Helen Benson, a Princeton professor, and other scientists are hastily assembled by the government in order to formulate a survival plan when it is feared that a large unknown object is due to impact Manhattan in approximately 78 minutes. Nothing can be done about it because a vital military satellite has been disabled. It hits Earth and out of the sphere comes a being named Klaatu emerges from the sphere while accompanied by a large robot. Klaatu, a representative of a group of alien races, has come to assess whether humanity can reverse the environmental damage it has inflicted on planet Earth. In the frightened confusion, Klaatu is shot, but survives and is taken to a government facility. While recovering from his injuries, Klaatu is detained by Regina Jackson, the United States Secretary of Defense, and is barred from speaking to the United Nations. Klaatu manages to escape, and he soon finds himself eluding the authorities throughout northern New Jersey, specifically Newark and the forested Highlands, with Helen and her stepson Jacob. After speaking with Professor Barnhardt about how his own species went through drastic evolution to survive its sun's demise, Klaatu is convinced by Helen and Jacob that humans can change their ways and are worth saving The three go toward the sphere in Central Park to stop the machine from destroying the world.  So when I really think about this movie, it just makes me sad. I was going to be fair with the rating, but gosh, those special effects? For 2008, it seems like we got worse with CGI, the ending effects were just way way way over the top. Keanu Reeves is sadly the only convincing actor in the film...? Oh, my God, did I just say that? Not to mention, did Kathy Bates owe someone a favor? She's a terrific actress, why was she in here? I also love how Jaden Smith, Will Smith's son, is taking his daddy's footsteps in alien movies, does Will Smith come from another planet? Because it seems like that family is obsessed with aliens. I'm going to do you a favor and recommend watching the original Day the Earth Stood Still, believe me, it's so much better.  3/10\", \"Laughter makes the almost two hours not a total loss. But I don't think, somehow, that \\\"The Day The Earth Stood Still\\\" was meant as a comedy. They must have realize however, that having John Cleese as the scientist was bound to provoke some giggles. Keanu Reeves is priceless as the wooden, expressionless alien. A great, unintentional, comic creation. Kathy Bates, in pantsuits if you please, plays the American Secretary of Defense and the whole thing doesn't have a single ingredient of the elements that made the Robert Wise original one of the classics of its genre. The visual tricks are good but repetitive and rather confusing. I must admit I wasn't bored I was just puzzled.\", \"Probably the biggest letdown of my sci-fi viewing life. Even worse than the 3rd \\\"Alien\\\" movie. So many bad points that I can't remember them all. I'll touch on the lowlights.  First, as the unidentified object approached earth, everyone seemed dumb on the reason for the change in direction. Duh uh, like wouldn't a spacecraft immediately come to mind as a possibility?? Then the excitement and anticipation of a visible ship was taken away by clouds and fog and a vague vessel.  As stated elsewhere, the initial contact in the park was ended with Klatu getting shot for an offered handshake (no mysterious equipment popping open). And several times in the movie, there were vehicles, equipment and/or people more evenly spaced out (in large areas) than a marching band.  Rather than go over a scene by scene critique, the following complaints come to mind. 1)bad writing; all actors had trite and often repetitive lines. 2)The Secretary of State was scary, illogical, and didn't seem to be in much contact with the bosses(the President and VP). 3)Poor or no acting by the \\\"Stars\\\" and the kid. 4) choppy flow, frequently too slow or unclear. Weak continuity, scenes seemed to be just stuck together. 5) Gort was pathetic. Like the recent \\\"Hulks\\\", unconvincing CG and too big to realistically show it in contact with humans. (should have gotten Shaq for the part).... 6) No actor to actor chemistry ever formed. 7) The final scenes completely missed out on the dramas of the \\\"standing still\\\" time and the alien departure. What message did he leave us with?   Since I'm a poor typist and can't immediately recall all of my issues with the film, I'll end my comments by saying that I have no problem with changing a remake so that it is more up to date and offers some different twists to add interest. However, this film completely missed the mark of maintaining the strengths that the original script had, namely convincing acting with consistent story and character build-up leading to a dramatic final scene with a clear message to all of the world.  They could and should have done far far better.\", \"\\\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\\" is a stunningly inept remake of the 1950's classic of the same name. It's one of those big-budget films so unfathomably dull and inane, you wonder how it ever got made. Whereas the original warned of the dangers of nuclear armament, this modern update boldly chides us for being mean to each other and not taking care of the environment. Gee, Hollywood, thanks for the swell insight! This Christmas season Hollywood teaches us that people can sometimes suck, but only that special kind of film can suck totally.   Although the entire production is horrible from top to bottom, the inert direction of Scott Derrickson and the randomly asinine script from David Scarpa bear most of the blame. The screenplay clearly went through arbitrary rewrites, perhaps after being focus-grouped to death, and shows not a single breath of imagination. Around every turn, it wastes opportunities and insults the intelligence of the audience and gives us not one authentic character or moment to connect to. Even when it thinks it's being cool (like the lame reveal that those alien spheres are actually \\\"arks\\\" trying to save animal life before the world is annihilated) the script fails miserably. One sphere that is shown on the back of a pick-up truck being attacked by flame-throwers in some foreign desert town inexplicably contains squid, because, well, the shadows of squid inside a giant sphere look kinda neat, that's why! At least the script teaches us one thing. Apparently all you need to do in order to survive an apocalyptic robotic alien insect attack that devours everything in sight is to hide under a bridge in Central Park!  The saddest part of the film is how the director wastes his talented cast. The always wooden Keanu Reeves was perfectly chosen to play the alien Klaatu, but even he seems to be disbelieving the words that are coming out of his mouth. Poor Jennifer Connelly, an immensely emotive and alluring actress, appears to be in physical pain or constipated for most the film, obviously stunned she agreed to star in this junk. Kathy Bates and John Cleese apparently showed up only for their paychecks and sleepwalk through their lines, and at one pivotal moment where Bates' Secretary of State attempts to show regret for some bad decisions made, she actually appears to fall asleep in her chair. And then there's poor little Jaden Smith, who appears bored to tears throughout the film and is given no direction from Derrickson except when he is asked to cry on cue in the supposed emotional climax of the picture that left me feeling sorry for all involved.  However, if anyone should be hung for this travesty, it's the producers, who must've run out of money at some point and filled the gap in funds with some nauseating product placement. How else do we explain Klaatu's trip to McDonald's for an important meeting with another of his kind?   \\\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\\" is easily the worst film of the year. At least \\\"The Happening\\\" had its accidentally humorous moments. This clunker offers no such relief. Even the special effects are done in a lazy and unimaginative manner. It's so awful, I was stunned into stillness while the rest of the audience seemed to shrug their shoulders.\", \"A schizophrenic film. Scott Derrickson has done his best to make a run of the mill CGI-enhanced sci-fi thriller but has found himself thwarted by the remarkable screen presence of Keanu Reeves and the ghost of Bernard Herrmann.  Reeves was the draw for me; where some find him laughable, I find him sober and engaging. His alien-in-a-human is at once non-porous of emotion but registers the emotional to-ing and fro-ing that decide his actions. He's a classy screen idol, well-cast. The rest of the cast (the very capable Jennifer Connelly included) are at the mercy of a truly ridiculous story both in concept and in local narrative. The gravity of the situation in which humankind as represented by Americans finds itself is only captured in the single-gear performance of Reeves and the unobtrusive but peculiar 'Herrmann' score, resurrected for the film by Tyler Bates.  There's a lot of silliness - a lot of cartoonish world's end drama which, strangely, doesn't do what it purports to which is update the 1951 original. It still feels dated. We are also presented with John Cleese as a Nobel Prize winner. Well that's also ridiculous on the face of it - but I tell you something, if the end where nigh and you wanted someone leftfield to plead your seemingly intractable case, you'd do a lot worse than Cleese. As a final oddity the product placement in the film seems at odds with the frowning upon consumerism that's at it's heart. Or maybe they're companies leading the charge to save the world. It's all a bit confusing. 4/10\", \"Ouch! $11 times 2 wasted on IMAX. There are so many plot holes in this film I don't know where to begin. 1. A UFO is rushing towards NYC. Prediction is a cataclysmic collision. They assemble a team of scientists and rush them right to ground zero. Are you kidding? Never happen. 2, The UFO \\\"lands\\\" and the first people out are the scientists. Even ahead of the military. One walks right up to shake hands with the alien. Please! Never happen. 3.Klaatu is brought for interrogation. They bring him into a room with a lone interrogator and leave. Are you kidding? No guards in the room? Never happen. 4. The military decides to enclose GORT in giant steel panels. They built these in a matter of hours? How? Where? 5. After enclosing him, he is lowered into some underground laboratory that appears custom-made for him. Where did that come from? How did they get him there? 6. They break a diamond drill on GORT and say it will take 24 hours to fix. The boss barks \\\"Fix it now\\\"!. They send in a poor schlub who promptly screws on a new drill bit. Then the sucker dies. 7. Klaatu meets with another of his kind who has lived among us for 70 years and apparently become quite fond of us. Why didn't he convince the rest of the aliens not to destroy humanity? He came to the same conclusion that Klaatu eventually reaches. 8. The \\\"swarm\\\" is destroying everything man-made in its path. We see it destroy Giants Stadium in a matter of seconds. Then it is in Central Park. Why aren't all the buildings in Manhattan falling down? Klaatu hasn't done anything to stop them up to this point. Oh--I could go on and on. Then there are all of the plot clich\\u00e9s; Good scientist resists evil government. Frustrated step-mom/ disconnected stepson find redemption through love of dead father/husband. Boo hoo hoo. Stupid general fires all his big guns at indestructible alien. You know what's going to happen. Yup, general gets destroyed/vaporized/eaten. Oh, fugitive scientist, alien, and kid go to see kindly old professor. They always do that. And the authorities always show up there. This movie stinks on ice. I'm not a huge fan of the original but at least that had a story and decent acting.\", \"The Day the Earth Stood Still is an utterly pointless movie remake. The original - and I'll pause here for everyone who's never seen it to roll their eyes - is one of the best sci-fi films of all times. This modern telling keeps only the names of the characters and abandons everything else.  In this version the trouble starts early on. Alien visitors arrive on earth (in an improbably crowded Central Park at night) but we don't see the landing of their vessel. Instead we get lots of dramatic mist and scientist types in haz-mat gear looking lost. Keanu/Klaatu emerges from a pretty orb, greets the pretty microbiologist, then gets shot.  Cue Gort, the indestructible robot guardian of peace. In what should have been the most dramatic part of the film ends up being its biggest disappointment. Gort, a textbook example of budget CGI filmaking, appears and makes a loud noise that frightens police dogs. And just when he seems poised to open a can of whip-ass, he gets silenced by Keanu/Klaatu who is coiled up in a fetal position on the pretty microbiologist's lap.  The rest of the movie plays like a throwaway Spielberg vehicle with a cute kid, lots of cheap sentiment, an alien who eventually goes home and the never-ending message that Love Will Save The Day.  Listen folks, save your money and seek out the 1951 version, filmed in beautiful black & white. The soundtrack alone is worth the price of a rental and when you see it, you can join the legions of fans who's eyes glaze over when they hear those three immortal words: klaatu barada nicto.\", \"I don't know about the earth standing still but I certainly had a hard time moving after this one finished. I think I may have been in shock. I didn't know they still made movies as bad as this. That's me, I guess; the eternal optimist, thinking one day Hollywood will see the error of their ways. I'm starting to think there's a greater chance of aliens landing in Manhattan though. You don't take a highly regarded classic like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and update it for no reason other than to make a few bucks. Sure, you can pretend there is purpose; you can cash in on the current environmental crisis fears by insinuating that aliens have come to earth to save the planet from the horrifically unappreciative human race. When you make a film with such disregard for quality though, you can't do anything to convince me that you actually care about what you're trying to say.  I will give Hollywood this though; they have finally found the perfect vehicle for the now- veteran Hollywood actor, Keanu Reeves. Reeves plays Klaatu, an alien in human form who has no capacity of expressing human emotion or understanding the intricacies of human nature and interaction. It might as well say that at the top of Reeves's resume so this is Reeves in his element. Honestly though, this is the first time I can say that Reeves's presence in a film has absolutely nothing to do with why it is unwatchable. You know you have a problem when dialogue is so bad that it even drags Reeves's acting down. In fact, having the familiar Reeves on board for this uneventful journey, alongside the strikingly beautiful, Jennifer Connelly, at least gives us something pretty to distract us from the banality of the entire affair. Klaatu certainly rocks that three-piece suit though.  The earth is supposed to stand still on this particular day because aliens have descended upon Central Park in a giant weather sphere of sorts. It is a momentous occasion, one that could be the sign of the end of days. Yet, in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, panic hardly seems to be in the air. Panic comes from a fear of the unknown and an inability to see a solution to your problems but David Scarpa's script is so painstakingly obvious and formulaic that you can see right through to the end at all times. I hope I'm not giving anything away here but as if this film would finish with humanity's extinction. And when the devices used to create the melodrama are so laughably contrived (who knew that a white step mom and a black step son could have such hard times getting along?), at least you have the special effects to revel in. Mind you, when the special effects are even more ridiculous than the ensuing melodrama in a big sci-fi pic like this, what is there to keep you sitting still, let along standing?  You'll never believe this but humanity, or at least the American government run portion of humanity, take immediate military action against the alien invaders before giving them the chance to make their case. This next bit is even more shocking. Apparently, violence is not the answer to solving our problems. I swear, I learned so many hard life lessons watching this movie. Perhaps the most important lesson though is that humanity will never learn. THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL represents the same disposable and commercial interests that are the root of our environmental problems. Yet, here is it preaching against the very values that justify its existence. For that reason alone, I would consider this film to be one of the most hopeless (and hapless) films of the year. We're essentially doomed so I say you can take it, Klaatu. Earth is all yours. We clearly don't deserve it.\", \"Why do these movies feel they need to include a bratty, spoiled, overbearing kid?? The ridiculous performance of Jaden Smith added annoyance to the empty script.  The movie starts off well enough, and then tries miserably to develop the characters and make us care for them. The Bates role is absurd; Cleese's role has virtually nothing to say this amazing encounter. The military point of view is typical; as if there's only one area where the military is useful (I would expect nothing less from \\\"Hollywood\\\").  There were some very interesting ideas (the sphere-like ship, the nanobots, the Gort acronym) and the effects were top notch, however Gort (the one thing the movie had going for it) was on screen for less then 10 minutes.  Keanu was perfectly cast and Connelly does a good job with what's given to her. All in all, another flop of a remake. This actually makes the War of the Worlds remake shine.  I saw this movie in IMAX - if you're going to see it, find an IMAX theater. Lastly, am I the only sick of seeing the same old New York back drop? I love New York City, but come on!

It puts to shame such films as \\\"Aliens\\\" or \\\"Armageddon\\\" that are content to inundate the viewer with special effects while their plots revolve around stunts that butcher the laws of physics, testosterone-laden one-liners, heroes equipped with enough artillery to conquer Iraq, and pathetic attempts to inject \\\"meaning\\\" into the barrage on screen with \\\"emotional sequences\\\" that only serve to further insult the intelligence of the audience. The supreme tragedy, of course, is that these kind of lobotomized movies are also the most popular. I think that there is a cause for this, although it isn't very comforting. There is an increasing trend in our culture to passively \\\"surrender\\\" to the media -- to immerse oneself in the images we see without dedicating a single brain cell to comprehending the statement the work is trying to make. This mindset is becoming increasingly dominant in all arenas; even the once-hallowed print medium is being diluted, thanks to the abominable \\\"reader response\\\" theory that pervades our schools and the \\\"tabloid brigade\\\" that lines our magazine racks whose mentality appears to be infiltrating the once-venerable mainstream press. Nowadays, we just flip the switch and put our minds on \\\"pause.\\\" Is \\\"The Thing\\\" a \\\"good\\\" movie? For the rare individual who still values his faculty of reason, a more appropriate term would be \\\"entertaining.\\\" Its plot keeps one guessing, its ending is uncompromising, and it has some redeeming statements to make about human paranoia. Upon subsequent viewings, one begins to note a conspicuous lack of depth in the acting, but the taut storyline remains compelling. Of course, \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" it's not, but then again sci-fi never was a thinking-man's genre...\", \"When John Carpenter's masterly version of \\\"The Thing\\\" was released in summer 1982, it was panned by critics and bombed at the box office. The audiences couldn't handle another 'bad' alien, they wanted ET. Their loss in the long run.  I would kill to be able to see this great movie on the big screen. This is a movie that was way ahead of it's time; now it has influenced a new generation of filmmakers, showing it's trail on things like \\\"Se7en\\\", \\\"Alien 3\\\", and even \\\"The X Files\\\", which unceremoniously ripped it off page by page. And the structure, which eschews character development in favour of incredible SFX, is commonplace in today's blockbuster flicks.  Carpenter shows the same skills he honed in \\\"Halloween\\\", using the camera to create an unsettling and claustrophobic atmosphere. The performances are all fine, and the ending is terrific - still unique today.  A paranoid masterpiece.\", \"It couldn't.  From the cutting dialogue to the super special effects this film was a joy to behold throughout. The immediate feel for the bitterness of the antarctic, the affinity for the characters that is built up at the base level before the real action heats up and the cunning finale combine to make this one of the most memorable and enjoyable films around.  Up against a long list of films that have attempted to exploit the theme of visitors from another planet, The Thing comes out on top and laughing. Who can forget the perfectly timed dialogue and the chilling special effects? Special effects that are a lot more impressive than the computer generated images that we get to see today. I for one found some of the most enjoyable aspects of the film to be the way that we were introduced slowly to each member of the crew, and the way that they all had some distinctive character traits. This wasn't just a senseless bloodbath-come-slasher-horror flick. This film had feeling. Emotion.  I truly can't recommend this film highly enough. I have yet to see anything in it's class that comes anywhere near to matching, let alone bettering, the near perfect acting and timing utilised in this cunning polymesmeric feat of cinema.\", \"I first saw this film accidentally when they showed it on TV and I was up far too late... I really lucked out there though. It's truly incredible; from the location (as isolated as it's possible to be on this planet; it made \\\"the abyss\\\" look like ET in the council swimming pool), through the interesting characters (Keith David is especially good as the reactionary Childs -\\\"What if we're wrong about him?\\\" - \\\"Then we're wrong.\\\") and the effects (more yucky than Alien).  Moreover, however, the real tension and fear in the film has nothing to do with the effects. It's the people you start being scared of; knowing that one of them may - or may not be - \\\"All they appear to be\\\". It's certainly got the feel of \\\"who goes there?\\\".  The soundtrack is great; it really plays up the isolation, fear, and gravity of the situation.  Finally, the epilogue scene really, really cuts. Even more than the \\\"But then again who does ?\\\" punchline of Bladerunner. Enough said.\", \"\\\"The Thing\\\" is John Carpenter's best movie. Merging his talents for tension building and shocks with decent production values he turned out a perfectly crafted sci fi / horror movie.  By filming in truly difficult conditions he creates a very believable isolated research base which sets the tension before anything has even happened. The ensemble cast work well together with Kurt Russell proving a charismatic leading man even under all that beard.  By building the tension slowly with moments of gory horror (courtesy of effects meister Rob Bottin - currently directing Freddy vs Jason) Carpenter creates a movie that has rarely been matched. Considering this came out the same year as ET it could not be more different!  Worth a watch / rewatch. 9 out of 10.  p.s. the DVD is excellent. Lots of extras plus the best DVD commentary going (with Carpenter & Russell). Plus remixed in Dolby Digital for even scarier sound effects.\", \"This is one of the most outstanding horror movies i've ever seen in my life time. Forget the exorcist and all the other hype horror movies out there.John Carpenter as made a tour-de-force horror epic with outstanding special-effects great performances from Kurt Russell and co and a great soundtrack that will haunt you for ever! The greatest thing about this movie after 17 years is it has'nt dated it looks fresh and new and you don't get many movies like this.Back in 1982 this was up against E.T. and of course it failded and was a box-office bomb. Over the years THE THING as made a cult following from video and t.v sales and as many new fans. In the end this movie kicks ass and to me it as never loss it's edge to scare the pants off of you and to me that a horror movie. Long live John Carpenter!!\", \"I cannot believe I never added my two cents about this film as yet!  This is one of the best films of all time. Many critics and movie-goers alike talk of John Carpenter's \\\"Halloween\\\" for setting trends and being \\\"his best work\\\". Those folks have not seen this version of \\\"The Thing\\\" because it is right up there with \\\"Halloween\\\".  John Carpenter's work shines in this film. He took a film that was already made and instead of \\\"re-making\\\" the film, he made the book the first film was based on! Brilliant.  The casting of each man was great, the tension between them was real, it made me scream, made me scared, made me guess, made me laugh, made me question, even up to today \\\"who goes there?\\\" in that film. This film had no Hollywood sweetie pie or funny-type ending, and what a bold move not to have one in 1982. Another brilliant move.  I was at the screening for this film when I was on vacation in Southern California. The audience at the screening went wild! I carry those memories for years, it was so much fun! We all thought that there was no way on God's green earth this film was not going to be a hit. But by box office receipts, it was a dud because of \\\"ET, The Extra Terrestrial\\\" and \\\"Poltergeist\\\" two very good family oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this film came out.  This film was what I, as a horror film adult buff was looking for, a horror/thriller with an adult script, and real adult actors. Not kids playing adults. Not little Miss \\\"big-breasted\\\" scream-queen of the day running around screaming for titilation BUT real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues you'll ever hear. Heck, being a feminist, I didn't even MISS women in this film! And good for Mr. Carpenter by not putting one in there, it really wouldn't have made sense! (Unless, \\\"The Thing\\\" was actually feminine! Something to think about!)  I saw special effects of that time I had never seen before, I saw makeup that made me sit up a few nights. This is what horror/thrillers of today are missing. Today, the Directors wimp out. Today, the Studios wimp out. Too much CGI and not enough belief, too much CGI and not enough story, not enough imagination. You leave the theater and in a week -- or less -- you forget about the film and move onto the next grand film opening. This one stays with ya. That's one of the marks of an excellent film.  On many reviews I've written how now paying $10 for a film is horrid. For films like this one, you'd pay it and not feel slighted. This film is NOT for everyone.  I find it horrific that they lable this film a \\\"cult\\\" film. I find that the audience is broader than many would lead you to belive and although not a commercial success in 1982, this is an example of how releasing a darn good film on the wrong date can make a darn good film look bad. After John Carpenter's film, many people copied many techniques, make-up, special effects and story lines from this version of \\\"The Thing\\\".  I am now excitd to go on record and state that this film is one of the best films of all time, very much under rated. Please see it uncut, please see it in letterbox and please hear it digitally. You'll talk about it for years as well.\", \"This being my first John Carpenter film, I must say I was very impressed by The Thing. Right from the beginning, the film draws you in, and never lets up on the tension. The film's special effects and models hold up well even today. Other than Kurt Russell, I wasn't familiar with any of the cast members but they were all exceptional in imparting fear, paranoia, and the desperation to survive. The Universal DVD has a wealth of very interesting behind the scenes extras. Strongly recommended, 9/10.\", \"Aaah...The Thing.  To see a horror film in which not only is every character over the age of thirty, but distinctly UNattractive, makes a refreshing change, and reminds me of those distant times when actors were chosen because of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters, rather than because of their teen appeal on a magazine cover. And Carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over-styled parodies. And there's no gimmicky 'twist' ending, or cameo celebrity appearance, or lame pseudo-romantic subplot.  And I REALLY miss on-set physical effects; with all those 20 year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics. In the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howling, An American Werewolf in London, The Thing, The Company of Wolves, A Nightmare on Elm Street...what an era for horror effects! And don't get me started on the death of matte painting. The matte work in this movie is beautiful and seamless.  What do we have now? Third rate CGI, former music video directors and professional stylists, that makes even 'gritty' horror movies look like glossy MTV videos.  Now I'm going to go Netflix 'The Howling'.\", \"For me, a ten-star film is one that never dies in my memory, and yet can be watched over and over again with the same pleasure as the first time. This could be a technically flawed movie; the pleasure has nothing to do with spit-and-polish (my personal top-ten is idiosyncratic, to say the least!). John Carpenter's \\\"The Thing\\\" is one of very few films to fit this criterion.  I've been a science fiction fan since I was a child in the Sixties, and I read the John W Campbell short story on which the film is based (\\\"Who Goes There\\\") before I saw the original, black-and-white Howard Hawks film (as with a lot of people, that viewing was illicit, on the TV, when I should have been in bed!). That movie, as with so many that you see as a child in such circumstances, seemed near perfection: the suspense, the inexplicable nature of the alien, the photography; it all just seemed to work. I watched it many times in the years after (and still do, when it is shown on TV). Because of this, I avoided the Carpenter version for years - seeing remakes of one's favourite film is, I thought, always a mistake. When I did eventually watch it sometime in 1988/9, again on TV because there was nothing else on, I realised that I need to change \\\"always a mistake\\\" to \\\"usually a mistake\\\"! Carpenter had produced something different from the original film, closer to the original story, and truly wonderful. From the opening scene of the helicopter and husky, through the viscerally disturbing scene in the dog-pound, to that ending (sorry, no spoilers here!), I was hooked. The sound track alone lives with me - all I have to hear is a close similarity to that bass-over-snare drum beat, and I'm *in* the final scene again ...  Until seeing \\\"The Thing\\\", I had Carpenter down as just another gore-monkey, based only on comments and reviews in mainstream press. Since seeing \\\"The Thing\\\", I think I have seen most of his movies - I haven't gone out of my to do so, but if one comes up, just seeing his name as director is enough to make up my mind to watch it. He is thoughtful, and knows how to build a film up so that it reaches a point at which something will stick in the memory.  If you haven't seen \\\"The Thing\\\", and you enjoy science fiction, do yourself a favour - sit down in a dark room, wrap up warm, and prepare to have your memory enhanced!\", \"In an era where nearly every great horror film of the 60s and 70s is being remade for audiences weaned on horror flicks of today that are not too terribly good, it is instructive to look back at John Carpenter's 1982 opus THE THING, which itself is a remake--of a childhood favorite of the director's, Howard Hawks' 1951 sci-fi/horror classic THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE. Although Carpenter's film was not initially that big a box office hit when released in mid-1982, it has since garnered a very large following.  In fact, Carpenter's film is less of a remake of Hawks' film than it is a reworking, as he goes back to the original idea posited by the source material, namely the John W. Campbell story \\\"Who Goes There?\\\", in which a US scientific crew in Antarctica is menaced by a shape-changing alien thawed out from the ice after 100,000 years. Kurt Russell, who had starred for Carpenter in the director's 1979 TV movie ELVIS and the 1981 film ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, heads a cast of stalwart character actors, including Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart, and Richard Masur, in this tension-filled exploration of paranoia, as the shape-changing \\\"thing\\\", which first comes to their camp in the form of a guide dog a Norwegian team is trying to kill, takes over each of them one by one. It isn't long before everybody in the camp begins to mistrust his fellow man. The ending of the film, in which Russell and David are the only ones left, has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity akin to the similar codas to both THE BIRDS and STRAW DOGS.  Almost universally, when the subject of THE THING is bought up, the emphasis is on the extremely gory special effects make-up and alien designs created by Rob Bottin, who had worked with Carpenter on the 1980 horror classic THE FOG, and on Joe Dante's 1981 werewolf film THE HOWLING. These effects are indeed quite spectacular and graphic, and even today, they can also be quite stomach-turning. But all of this would make Carpenter's film nothing more than a high-end splatter epic if the direction, the story, and the acting weren't up to snuff; and thankfully, each of them are. When he's not concentrating on the enormously gruesome transformation sequences, Carpenter builds suspense in the same Hitchcock-influenced way that informed his previous films HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, with cinematographer Dean Cundey's prowling camera-work, particularly through the corridors of the station, a significant help. The acting enhances an already-fine screenplay adaptation by Bill Lancaster; and we are also given a taut score by Ennio Morricone, whose work on director Sergio Leone's classic 1960s Italian spaghetti westerns is well known to all, including of course Carpenter himself. THE THING also features additional fine visual effects from Albert Whitlock (who worked on many Hitchcock films, including THE BIRDS), and Roy Arbogast, who worked on CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and JAWS 2.  Carpenter's film was not the success it could have been because Universal chose to release this graphic shocker a mere two weeks after it had released Steven Spielberg's far more family-friendly E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (not surprisingly, critics and audiences at the time favored Spielberg's excellent film over Carpenter's equally excellent but exceedingly different one). Also, most of the horror film box office business in 1982 was going to another Spielberg-produced film, POLTERGEIST. As a result, at a cost of $15 million, THE THING suffered from lack of attention in its time.  Over time, however, many have come to see Carpenter's film for what it is--an extremely gory but extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, done with a great deal of flair and a true understanding of the psychological paranoia at the heart of its story. Though it is still quite gruesome, THE THING should be as much remembered for the skill by which the story is put together as it is for the gory alien designs and make-up effects; for it is the storytelling skill and the suspense that make it so memorable in the final analysis.\", \"A brilliant horror film. Utterly gruesome and very scary too. The Thing is a remake from John Carpenter, but please, do not let that put you off this film. It is simply brilliant. The start of the film has the alien's spacecraft hurtling towards the Earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the film's title in amazing shining white and blue stating 'THE THING'. One of the best opening credits for a horror film ever.  The cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their Station in Antartica is visually impressive on DVD widescreen. It must have been great in the cinema. I regret not seeing this on the big screen.  Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base. All the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected. My favourite scene in the whole film has to be when Macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection, it is tense, scary and finally spectacular. I love it because its funny as well.  Special mention must go to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself. If he didn't get an Oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have. This is also debatable as to whether this is John Carpenter's greatest film...its certainly a gruesome masterpiece.  Wait for a cold winter night. Get some Budweiser from the fridge. Sit down and watch The Thing, a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting shape changing towers of gore and slime.  Utterly brilliant.  Ten Out Of Ten.\", \"John Carpenter's \\\"The Thing\\\" is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made. Sadly as with most Carpenter movies go it is also one of the most underrated movies being panned by critics shortly after it's release for a reason that is almost pathetic. It seems that at the time people were overwhelmed by the idea of the \\\"good\\\" alien. An idea spawned after the success of \\\"I.T.\\\". And the very thought that a movie dealing with aliens could deviate from that idea was regarded as heresy. Human ignorance is truly a frightening thing, people need to judge films for what they are not for what they want them to be.  \\\"The Thing\\\" itself is an interesting study on human paranoia as members of a U.S. Antarctic base discover the presence of an alien being (refered throughout the movie only as a \\\"thing\\\") able to imitate any form of life. Not knowing who might or might not be the creature, we see how every character reacts to the situation. There is no mass hysteria or panic just a slow and gradual descent in to chaos as more and more people turn up to be... not quite human.  Carpenter succeeds into elevating this movie into something far more than your average Sci-Fi/horror. There are no \\\"whats behind you?\\\" jumping moments here. Instead relying on an intense atmosphere of mistrust and pre-apocalyptic despair along with some nicely balanced moments of visual terror with no small thanks to Rob Bottin's impressive creature effects, he gives us an experience not matched by many other horror films.  Instead of just throwing facts and plot elements at our face Carpenter offers us a much a more gradual and delicate approach. By implying a sense of mystery he gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret-ate what has transpired in certain scenes, while giving enough plot to those who are not so fond of interpretation in movies.  Ennio Morricone's score works all the way. It's minimalistic and depressing sound perfectly fits the movie's overall tone. Although I've always wondered how would it have sounded if Carpenter (he has been known to compose all of his movies's OSTs except this one) did it? Characters while not as deeply developed are still memorable thanks to the good performances of the actors especially Kurt Russel who plays the \\\"down-out\\\" apathetic helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady. Its worth noting how his character transforms through the movie. From his disregardful \\\"don't give a ....\\\" attitude in the beginning, to that of a unifier and leader of the group of men who try to fight \\\"the thing\\\". But even with that said, there are no false heroics here, there are no \\\"laughing at the face of death\\\" moments and there certainly isn't any sort of comic relief, the movie keeps its atmosphere from the very first scene to the last. Speaking of which, here once again Carpenter keeps his tradition of creating a powerful ending.  Quarter of a century after its release \\\"The Thing\\\" doesn't feel dated. And with the disturbingly growing use of computer-generated effects it feels even stronger then before because it shows the life's work and dedication of human beings not computers. Combined with its openness for analyzing it gives the viewer a lot more reasons to watch it for a second or third or fourth or ... time. A masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten.\", \"People with an aversion to gore may find some scenes hard going, but The Thing is far from being simply a horror classic. The fact that the extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day CGI is only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing, superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film justice. Absolutely essential viewing.\", \"John Carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of Sci-Fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it to the extreme. A remake of the Howard Hawks produced 1951 original, Carpenter keeps the Cold-War themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation of the Antarctic setting. Carpenter's direction as always is excellent as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of body takeover. But here and much like the work of David Cronenberg, Carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident, as through some fantastic special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore. However, he never loses touch with the human side of the story, as in the face of everything shocking happening in front of us, we are left with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.  9/10\", \"When in 1982, \\\"The Thing\\\" came out to theaters everywhere, it had a cold reception and very poor box-office results, becoming almost a failure in John Carpenter's career as a horror director; however, time has proved that \\\"The Thing\\\" was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the film's fault. Nowadays, John Carpenter's \\\"The Thing\\\" has gained the appreciation it rightfully deserves and is considered by many horror fans as a horror classic, and not without a reason, as this new version of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s story \\\"Who Goes There?\\\" (previously adapted as \\\"The Thing From Another World\\\") is closer to the original tale and keeps a pessimistic feeling of dread and high doses of suspense in a masterfully crafted study about paranoia.  The plot of \\\"The Thing\\\", begins in the winter of 1982 in a U.S. research station located in the remote territories of Antarctica, when the members of the crew notice a Norwegian helicopter coming their way. The two apparently insane pilots of the helicopter are trying to kill a Husky dog who makes its way into the American base. After the Norwegians are killed accidentally, the Americans try to figure out what made them to be insane. Soon they'll discover that the Husky dog the Norwegians were hunting was not a normal dog, but a creature able to mimic every living creature, and not only that, it has a tremendous hunger.  Director John Carpenter earned a place in history when in 1978 he directed the seminal slasher \\\"Halloween\\\", where suspense and atmosphere were above gore and shock. \\\"The Thing\\\" could be seen as an evolution of that style, as even when Carpenter makes great use of Rob Bottin's special effects (which were labeled by critics as \\\"repulsive\\\" on its day), the film still focuses more on atmosphere and suspense rather than in the violent (and very well-done) displays of gore. The feeling of loneliness, as well as the \\\"bad karma\\\" between the members of the crew increase the feeling of paranoia as anyone could be the Thing, even our main character, R. J. MacReady (Kurt Russell), ending in a situation where nobody can be trusted.  This plot element was more faithful to the concept of the source novel, and was blatantly ignored by the previous version (not completely a bad thing, just a big difference), making this version feel less like a remake and more as a new conception of the source novel. Bill Lancaster's script handles the characters with brilliant domain, giving us enough to distinguish them, but not too much to completely trust them, making them an essential factor in the film's haunting feeling of dread that keeps running through the movie. The mystery and the suspense are at the max, as never one can tell who is the Thing and who is normal, enhancing the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent results.  The cast is very effective, and their performances as a whole so effective that one can almost feel the bad feelings between their characters as real. Carpenter's regular collaborator Kurt Russell as MacReady carries the film, and through his eyes we witness the madness and the horror the research station becomes as the situations goes worse. Definitely one of his best performances. Wilford Brimley is also terrific as Dr. Blair, a scientist that goes insane after discovering the Thing's purposes.  \\\"The Thing\\\" is a film so wonderfully crafted that its flaws tend to go unnoticed, although they exist. The most notorious being the very low-key and at times unappropriated score by Ennio Morricone. It's not exactly bad, but it just feels out of place at some scenes and it's not one of the best works by the legendary composer. Also, due to some misshapes with the special effects, some scenes were left out that actually fill some small plot holes, although nothing of big importance or actually annoying.  When talking about John Carpenter's films, most people will almost instantly name \\\"Halloween\\\" as his favorite film, but personally, I would go with \\\"The Thing\\\", as I consider it Carpenter's greatest achievement so far, and one of the most interesting and actually scary horror films ever made. I would go as far as to call it one of the finest films ever made. 10/10\", \"The Thing is a milestone in movie-making and remains one of my favourite films of all-time. Despite the film's roots in science-fiction it is ultimately a horror film that brilliantly balances splatter with psychological trauma. Today, Over twenty five years after its release, the special effects stand up as an example of sheer brilliance and effects man Rob Bottin suffered a complete physical breakdown for his art. It would be impossible to make the same movie today as the Studio would most certainly insist on casting a female character or a Paul-Walker type.  An all-male American Science team in Antarctica are thrown into turmoil when an alien lifeform able to perfectly absorb and imitate other lifeforms infiltrates their camp. Their trust in each other steadily crumbles as they become increasingly unsure who is real and who is an imitation, and this 'body-snatchers' scenario sees their numbers steadily dwindle as one-by-one, they fall victim to The Thing. When cornered, it manifests itself as a different nightmarish creature, the metamorphosis always horrific and compelling.  The helplessness, isolation and claustrophobia of a team of desperate men with no way out of their situation and no way of help reaching them is expertly sustained. The long hours of darkness and the mounting snowfall provide a bleak backdrop to the terror that unfolds. Director John Carpenter selected with great care a team of brilliant character-actors and each member of the team fits perfectly into the part they play, whether it be the young and street-wise chef, the elderly and wise Doctor or the bitter and cynical helicopter pilot. The point is that no-one here comes close to being an all-American badass superhero with blonde locks and a six-pack and the film's real strength is thanks in no small part to this stark realism. The people suffering on-screen are recognisable in our daily lives.  The Thing remains consistently enjoyable and affecting even after repeated viewings. I have now seen the film on more than twenty separate occasions and my amazement at the quality of the direction, the acting and the special effects is unwavering. My girlfriend prefers the high-school spin-off of the film -The Faculty- which is good and solid entertainment but far more light-hearted and whistful. She still loves and acknowledges the brilliance of The Thing however, and thank goodness for that... Because I could not remain in the company of someone who didn't love this movie.  A classic and then some.\", \"In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing. Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.  Its not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!  It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways. Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien. And that's even rarer!  Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.  Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.  They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own. Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But a shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.  The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films. In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.  But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly. And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.  The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!  That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to. Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications. Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing. We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.  A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.  The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received. And so much better than ET!\", \"In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched, brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh, detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old film.  With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone. I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky, curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in itself).  It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes. That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and atmospheric to a T.\", \"The silly saying, \\\"You can't touch this\\\" surely applies here. With all the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee out of me when I was a pre-teen.  THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest, ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread, isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.  You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling, freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day, they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants. It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished, but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.  Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few of the fine cast. This film is the reason why horror CAN be a great genre. It actually STILL scares me. The alien blood \\\"jumping\\\" out of the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes ME jump!!!  Still the scariest of them all.\", \"The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies. Of course it was ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, I'd never seen anything like that! However, although the effects themselves made the movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the doomed research station that makes it a classic.   Movies don't get any better than this! In the opening scene with the the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored scientists from some station letting of some steam. Yet when you see them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain of cabin fever. Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score that sets the tempo! You just know that something is not right! At this point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself.   However, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha Christie \\\"who dunnit\\\" ( i.e. ten little Indians movie) sci-fi style as the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien. Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. The mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses until the final showdown.  After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making production the special effects in \\\"the Thing\\\" don't carry the same weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all round with some great performances by the cast.\", \"John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W Campbell Jr's short story. The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold. Carpenter manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery needed to keep the film heading in the right direction. Be it an horrific scene or a \\\"what is in the shadow\\\" sequence, the film to me is a perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is spot on for a group of men trying to keep it together under duress, and Carpenter's score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming thru the film. The cast are superb, a solid assembly of actors led by Carpenter fave Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used give the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it, lets wait and see what happens indeed, 10/10.\", \"Remake of the classic 1951 \\\"The Thing From Another World\\\". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are they going to do?  The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material--the novelette \\\"Who Goes There?\\\") and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding. There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off, heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material. I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!  It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful. You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.  This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with \\\"E.T.\\\" and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date film!  An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be close to a facility to throw up!\", \"Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite movie. My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing! The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from N.Y.) In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to do with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting. I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day the last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even the great \\\"Das Boot\\\".  Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror movies: Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're not interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV and watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll see it my way!  Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.\", \"Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film I've ever seen.  From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really gets you in the right mood.  The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say nothing less.  You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this. Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeup.  The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known. In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date. This movie is to be considered a classic.  The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!\", \"John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. What makes the movie so great? It's hard to put my finger on it. Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions where everything just seems to fall in place. The film is even superior to Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell. The fact that it's not only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a paranoia that is unmatched in films. A truly wonderful film that is worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in films.\", \"This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before CGI.  Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?  The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one; the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath is huge and the results are horrific.  This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre. Don't miss it.\", \"I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this film was only about a year ago. After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.  The film is terrific on many levels. It works as your straight monster or action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look into the human psyche. The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear, lent not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the incredible acting of the cast in general. Kurt Russell (obviously) is spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct result he \\\"feels\\\" like a real person, rather than a hollywood \\\"all american hero\\\". The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and the net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic film.\", \"\\\"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to, but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won.\\\"  John Carpenter's \\\"The Thing\\\" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made \\u0096 fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be made.  Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission, but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is when things really start to get crazy.  It is soon made quite clear that the \\\"dog\\\" is actually a shape-shifting alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims \\u0096 in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their friends and enemies  The pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at all?)  The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural prison.  \\\"The Thing,\\\" the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic \\\"Alien\\\" (1979). Many comparisons have been made \\u0096 the protagonists are stranded in a desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off one-by-one. However, \\\"The Thing\\\" \\u0096 for all practical purposes \\u0096 came first.  Based on the famous short story \\\"Who Goes There?\\\" by John W. Campbell, Jr. (writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The result was \\\"The Thing From Another World,\\\" an unarguable classic. But to be fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake does it more justice.  The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many advances in SFX.  Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening (and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years later.  Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.  From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all time, \\\"The Thing\\\" \\u0096 by any standards \\u0096 is unconventional Hollywood at its best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, \\\"The Thing\\\" performed poorly in theaters, and \\\"E.T.\\\" \\u0096 released the same year and featuring a much kinder alien \\u0096 became the higher-grossing picture of the two (by far).  In the long run, however, \\\"The Thing\\\" is superior in almost every conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th Anniversary Re-Release. \\\"The Thing,\\\" on the other hand, has gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics \\u0096 it is one of the most famous non-famous movies ever made.  Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career \\u0096 from his amazing \\\"Assault on Precinct 13\\\" (1976) to the magnificent \\\"Halloween\\\" (1978) to the disappointing and silly \\\"Escape from L.A.\\\" (1996), \\\"The Thing\\\" remains his very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never been honorary enough to land it a spot on most \\\"great movies\\\" lists, \\\"The Thing\\\" is still one of my favorite horror films, and \\u0096 upon close inspection \\u0096 masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is simultaneously unique and chilling \\u0096 a genuine relief for film buffs who are tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is genuinely unpredictable.\"], \"review_score\": [10, 9, 10, 10, 9, 9, 10, 10, 9, 9, 10, 8, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 8, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10], \"review_category\": [\"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 9.633333333333333}, \"The Time Machine\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0268695\", \"total_review_count\": 13, \"total_rating_count\": 13, \"review_content\": [\"Having not read the original book or seen the earlier film, and indeed knowing nothing about the storyline of either of those or the current film, I came to this film with an open mind.  It's really difficult to know where to start a comment on the film, because the whole thing seems so confused. It seems like there is a point or a message or something in the film, but what that is remains completely obscure.  The effects were fantastic and very well judged. The idea was set up really well with the motivation for time travel clearly made out. However, it was downhill from here.  All of the time travel seems to have only the vaguest connection to the quest that was set out at the start. There are some nice ideas, but they seem to be isolated occurrences that really do not flow and make the film seem disjointed and lost. At one point one wonders whether the main story in the film is the fate of the moon.  When Hartdegen arrives in 802,701 A.D., the film becomes very frustrating as he seems to be unable to discover anything of importance about the Eloi, and while it seems clear that there is something to find out, what it is remains annoyingly elusive. This is quite an odd change from the previous time travel instances and one wonders why all of this has suddenly been abandoned for what seems like a completely new story. So many things happen that there should be an explanation for, but there is no discovery. I really, really wanted to know what the film was \\\"getting at\\\", what there was to uncover, but to no avail. Having read a summary of what happens in the book at this point, it seems like there has been a very half-hearted attempt to render this in the film but it has been so simplified and \\\"dumbed down\\\" that the meaning and context is completely lost.  Just as we hope that we are finally to discover where this is all leading, the film suddenly takes another significant change in direction, and becomes a mindless action film without any real action. It is as if by this point the director has simply given up bothering to put any meaning into the film. By now countless significant things are happening without any explanation. Hartdegen fails to take the opportunity to return to the past on two occasions for no reason, and then suddenly loses all interest in time travel for no reason. The film comes to an abrupt end as Hartdegen decides to stay with the Eloi.  In summary, after a good start the film is very disappointing. Too much time is spent on Hartdegen's adventures before arriving with the Eloi. However, the worst part of the film is what I think is the most important part: the setting up of the situation with the Eloi. The whole point is completely missed, and this undermines the rest of the film. After this the film concentrates too much on effects and action and all attempts to return to the meaning and core of the film seem forced and out of place. With so many things happening without explanation, the film just seems to get lost and lose direction. However, the finale where Hartdegen decides he is no longer bothered about time travel is the most inexplicable of all.  Ultimately, the whole film seemed like a collection of unconnected incidents. The meaning and context was lost, although the gaping hole where it should have been was very obvious. What was so frustrating about it all, though, was that there was clearly so much potential here: it wasn't by any means a bad film, it just so easily could have been so much better. The start was very promising, the time travelling looked fantastic and would have worked had it not gone off on tangents, and Hartdegen's experience with the Eloi could so easily have worked had a few more of the right questions been asked, and had there not been such a temptation to \\\"dumb down\\\" and simplify. I just wish I had a time machine so that I could travel back in time and advise against the mistakes that were made.\", \"Do you know that they want to escavate the Moon for real?And in Geneve there is the debated project that could lead to make possible time machine?All i can say about this movie that is based on facts about future(at the time of the movie)scientifical projects but real. Hope the moon will exist not happen as in the movie. Now about the movie itself, I saw the original movie too, and I also read the book. The book I didn't like though, but the movie yes.I totally agree with a previous comment that this movie was depressing,unlike the 60's one.That was very good with force, this one was only a paralled future of what is good movie.\", \"This movie is a disgrace. How can you take one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time and turn it into some kind of half-assed love story. The entire beginning of the movie was not in the H.G. Wells story and didn't need to be. Also the Eloi were done completely wrong. They did build houses or form any kind of real society. They didn't care about each other at all. That was an important part of the story. The way they had formed a world that was without hardship or complex emotions. They were barely even aware of the Morlocks. I don't know why this movie was made the way it was but some stories should be told as they are or left alone.\", \"The Time Machine starts in New York during 1899 where Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) proposes to his beloved girlfriend Emma (Sienna Guillory) who accepts, unfortunately just after they are attacked by a mugger & Emma is shot dead & dies in Alexander's arms. Jump forward 'Four Years Later' & Alexander has built a time machine which he uses to travel back to the night Emma was killed in order to save her but she is still killed, only a different way this time. Alexander realises whatever he does, however many times he goes back Emma will always end up dead one way or another & he yearns to know the answer why so he travels far into the future to discover the truth. However after having destroyed the moon two new races have evolved on Earth, the human like Eloi & the monstrous Morlock's that eat the Eloi. Alexander decides to stick around & save the Eloi.  Directed by Simon Wells who is actually the great grandson of author H.G. Wells who wrote the original The Time Machine book on which the original The Time Machine (1960) film was based & it is in fact the 1960 film that producer John Logan's script is based upon here rather than Wells original literally source. While all three share the same basic story & ideas this remake adds the subplot about Alexander's fianc\\u00e9 Emma being killed & that's the reason he invents a time machine rather than just because he is clever & he can. The script is a mixture of sci-fi, action adventure & drama none of which really grabbed me or engaged me that much, sure there are a few pretty special effects, a few nice action scenes & the moment when Alexander's question is answered regarding why he can't save Emma is actually quite intelligent & makes sense it never really captured my imagination & I was never really moved by it either. The time travel aspects of The Time Machine feel very similar to Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1992) in the sense you can't change the past but at the same time the future is not set only The Time Machine isn't anywhere near as good a film as Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The character's are alright although I thought Guy Pearce just looked too young to be a brainy scientist capable of inventing a time machine & there's never any real explanation behind it's mechanics either as it's like one moment there's no time machine the next he has invented & made one & it works perfectly. I reckon the Back to the Future trilogy offer far more thrills, laughs, excitement & general entertainment value than The Time Machine ever does & while I will stop short of calling it a bad film since it moves along at a decent pace, tells a reasonable story & has it's moments I wouldn't call it brilliant or even particularly good. There is also a cheeky little reference to the book & original film which are both name-checked here.  The benefit this modern version has over the original is the development of special effects & in particular CGI which leads to scenes of time rapidly passing around Alexander in his time machine complete with huge buildings being built, new ridges, canyons & mountains being formed & a elaborate pan back which ends up in space as we see passenger rockets orbiting the moon. The effects work is good, there are one or two moments that look a little below par but generally speaking the effects are good. I saw The Time Machine on telly & the station playing it badly pan and scanned it so the left & right edges of the frame were cut off the screen thus cutting off part of the year on Alexander's time machine dial so I actually didn't know what year he went to. Apparently director Gore Verbinski took over the last eighteen days of filming as Wells was suffering from 'extreme exhaustion' while the IMDb says that the time machine itself was the biggest & most expensive prop ever built for a film at that point which I find hard to believe & Guy Pearce broke a rib during a fight scene but like a trooper carried on.  With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 the production values are high with a lovingly recreated period New York & good effects work although amazingly The Time Machine was nominated for an Oscar for best make-up but lost out to Frida (2002). The acting is mixed, Jermey Irons puts in a good performance in a terrible make-up job that has him looking like a reject from a Lord of the Rings film while singer Samantha Mumba makes her big screen debut here & is simply terrible although Guy Pearce is quite good & fairly likable.  The Time Machine isn't a particularly bad film or a particularly good one, just a somewhat unremarkable one that is watchable & passes an hour and a half but not much else. Watch Back to the Future (1985) again instead.\", \"If you loved the early-60's version of \\\"The Time Machine\\\", don't waste your time; as with last year's \\\"The Planet of the Apes\\\", this has been \\\"reimagined\\\", and not for the better. And, just as with \\\"Planet...\\\", its lead actor is woefully miscast and leaden; Guy Pearce, a terrific actor of great range, is all wrong for this role, giving a one-note performance that elicits zero sympathy; he's so dour and serious, and lacking in awe of the (supposedly) amazing things he sees that you don't believe for a moment that he's experiencing them. Worse yet, whose idea was it for him to resemble the love child of David Spade and Calista Flockhart?? A handsome actor, here he is sickeningly gaunt, which is, believe it or not, a major distraction. Frankly, the man looks gravely ill and is photographed cruelly. He shares absolutely NO chemistry with anyone on the screen, a direct result of a performance that is out of sync with anyone else's. Sadly, even with a proper leading man this movie doesn't stand a chance for it is fatally burdened with both a totally inept director - whole scenes go nowhere and are poorly realized - and a screenplay that is utterly inferior, scattered and at times incoherent - not for a single moment do you care about anyone in this film, for the single fact that there is NOTHING in the way of character development! In the original, you got to KNOW the Eloi, so therefore you felt for them, and felt their terror of the Morelocks; here, as the movie stresses several times, they are nothing but sheep and act accordingly. Unless you're a member of PETA, scared sheep are HARDLY the stuff of entertainment!   Samantha Mumba does as well as possible, in her movie debut, but, like everyone else in this mess, most especially Jeremy Irons (if he's the leader of the Morelocks [who look like rejects from \\\"The Mummy Returns\\\"], why then does HE look like Edgar Winter's long-lost brother?) is COMPLETELY WASTED. Also wasted was the money spent on the endless 'special' effects, which belie the $70M spent on the film; they are uniformly lackluster, obvious and unconvincing. And then there's the look of the film: poorly photographed, its art direction and sets are just \\\"there\\\" and its costumes are typical in design. There isn't an original thought or idea expressed behind or on the screen. Most of all, it isn't even fun! (The filmmakers use the now-ubiquitous Orlando Jones as \\\"comic relief\\\" but, as usual, Jones is irritating, and just HOW does his electrically-driven character survive in a world seemingly devoid of electricity?)  All in all, this is an empty, lifeless, dull, sterile and confused affair: didn't they ALREADY REMAKE \\\"Planet of the Apes\\\"??? (At least THAT had the fortune of some strong performances!)   *SPOILER!* The final insult (beyond a head-shakingly terrible, not to mention convenient, ending)? Not only do they BARELY feature the changing dress-store figures, they make even the time machine itself an anachronistic, gaudy glass-n-chrome bore! (If \\\"The Sopranos\\\" had a time machine, THIS is exactly what it would look like.) Pathetic...\", \"This movie sucked. From beginning to end it was predictable. There was absolutly no chemistry between Pearce and the Mumba chick. The plot went nowhere, floating off into oblivion. All of these led to the movie being very hilarious in its stupidity. And I wanted to strangle Orlando Jones, the guy just needs to go away.\", \"I was one of the many fools who were sapped out into paying for this at the theater, even though I payed 4 bucks for matin\\u00e9e (before 6pm) prices.  The remake's story was ho-hum, the CGI Morlocks were lame, the Eloi were rastafarian to mimic today's fads (no I did not think the chick was hot at all), the re-killing of the hero's modern girlfriend was somewhat cruel, overall just a sad, bad remake.   I'll take Rod Taylor, Weena, and the fat glowing eyed surfer Morlocks over this junk any time. My estimation is that many of the reviewers who like this awful remake are young kids, which does not account for either good taste or a true value of the old classics which are largely unappreciated by today's confused and ever-wanting-more youth.   When the 60s version came out (I first saw it in the 70s for summer fun) it was pretty damn impressive and still holds up. You don't have to have an over abundance of CGI in a movie for it to be better. Too much of this looks fake. I can't say enough of how disappointingly bad the Morlocks looked and they ran and jumped around like they were in a child's video game. 3 stars out of 10.\", \"After reading the novel which is about a one hour read, watching this film became a sad disappointing experience. Just as he did in prince of Egypt simon wells somehow managed to direct a script that took away all the drama and mystery out of its source material and turned it into this homogenized nonsense. Now I'm a sucker for cheese and camp but this movie made absolutely no sense. There was no joy in any of the performances or any humor. There were no thrills and that silly bookend with addy's character of filby throwing his hat in the air was the last hackwriting straw. I felt very violated when this movie was over and I still refuse to believe it was only 90 minutes it went on forever. I wondered how the studio and director could have OK'd such a lousy script but then my friend pitched the movie to me exactly as It was and I said wow that sounds great but what happened to the movie.\", \"It's a Time Machine all right. It runs in \\\"real time\\\" for 96 minutes but it felt like 96 years. The first 20 minutes were utterly superfluous. Massive amounts of \\\"dead\\\" time throughout. What happened? When will something happen? Who cares? Apparently the film was made on a tight budget, I note for your edification the following: The Morlochs: nothing like saving a little money by reusing the sets and costumes from Lord of the Rings part I, hey? The \\\"scary dude\\\" in charge of controlling the Morlochs... The scariest thing these guys could think of was somebody wearing one of Gene Simmons: (of the band Kiss) old costumes??? Little-known fact: freaks of the future have perfectly manicured nails.  Save your money, save your time. Pass on this one.\", \"Worst. Movie. Ever. I can't believe they had to hire Jeremy Irons to give this piece of crap some credibility - and still failed. Did they think that if they stuck to the plot of the book that their target audience wouldn't be able to figure it out on their own? (probably). \\\"Hey, let's make lots of things explode and give Mina big boobs, and have her speak in an adorably fake broken English. That'll make the morons watch.\\\" \\\"But sir, that's not how the book went at all, I think we're mot being faithful to Mr. Wells' message.\\\" \\\"F*ck it, we're going to the box office here, never mind some dead author's ideas on human nature. Also, let's add in Orlando Jones with some classic 'Black attitude' as a supporting character, and never mind the interesting conclusion to the book - Guy Pierce has to get some p*ssy at the end.\\\"\", \"Guy Pearce looks like and acts like a Calvin Klein underwear model, or one of those bimbo guys who wear Levi's Jeans and stand in front of a herd of stampeding Buffalo because they realize that Buffalo like Levi's too. In every scene, Guy Pearce looks like he is saying, \\\"Look at me, I am so pretty!\\\" As a hero, his character is a total wimp. In every scene that calls for courage, Pearce gets the short end of the stick. SPOILERS: Yet, at the end of the movie, this wimpy book-worm character out-runs a pack of baboon-like Morlocks who can run and leap along the side of the walls (like Spiderman). Around the same time, the TIME MACHINE seems to cause a Nuclear Explosion of some kind that wipes out an entire valley. Strangely, even though Pearce and his gal-pal Mumba are about a foot away from the last Morlock that gets killed; seconds later Pearce, Mumba, and the tribe are watching the valley blow up from the safety of their mountain. Now THAT is FAST RUNNING!!! Jeremy Irons as the King of the Morlocks is great. He really makes the movie a lot better than it was. Mumba, the model-turned-actress is not very cute, and she does not do much acting in this movie. The scenes which take place in the 1900s lack any real atmosphere. Even though the period dress and vehicles are shown, the characters act like caricatures of how they imagine 1900s people would walk and talk. The original version of this movie was a lot better in this respect. The period characters were much more realistic, and they were much better actors. The original version of this movie made the PAST seem like the real base of the characters. This new version lacks substance and feeling. The scenes in which Pearce deals with the death of Emma and then fails to save her from her fate are very good. The issue of the Morlocks being cannibals is not very well explained, and it does not make sense that they have some large dark butcher shop filled with knives and cutlery, yet they are never seen using any weapons except for a blow-dart. Also silly is the giant pit full of water and bones. All through the underground, the Morlocks are all walking around chewing on meaty bones. So how can all those skeletons be in the pit? It seems like there are some Morlocks that Bar-B-Que their humans and eat them off the grill, and other Morlocks only like filleted flesh?? And where are the restrooms for all of these creatures? As I was watching the dozens of Morlocks who were gorging themselves on human flesh, it occurred to me that they must have a very advanced toilet & plumbing system, considering that they were tossing in lots of bones. All these issues were never addressed. At the end of the movie, Pearce is holding Mumba's hand, but you can see that he is eye-balling her friend, Mandingo. One other totally irritating thing about this movie is the non-stop LION KING music which is in the background. Once Pearce arrives in the future (802,710 a.d.); the LION KING music never stops, and every time the natives are around, there is that African Moaning Singer (Is it Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?) that starts wailing and moaning over the LION KING jungle music. I watched the credits at the end of the movie, and the jungle music is not specifically identified, but I think that Elton John should probably look into this matter. Time Machine was a mediocre movie with some good FX. See it once, then forget it.\", \"H.G. Wells is spinning. No doubt about it.  Really, this would have been a decent sci-fi/adventure movie, if it hadn't been based on a classic novel and directed by the author's grandson. I kept hearing about how this would be the definitive version of the novel. What resulted was a pathetic and simpleminded bastardization.  The novel is a great sci-fi story but what a lot of people miss when they read it (probably because they read it when they're very young) is that it's overflowing with social commentary. The Eloi and Morlocks are a satire of the class distinctions of Victorian England, and the overall message of the film is that EVERYTHING DECAYS AND DEGENERATES, a satiric jab at Victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization would last forever. There's no love story, no romance with a beautiful Eloi woman....in the novel, the Eloi are 3-foot-tall childlike beings with a mental capacity not far above that of an animal. The Time Traveler does befriend an Eloi woman but it's clear he thinks of her more like a pet, and anyway she's killed before the novel ends.  This movie first tries to give us a totally stupid backstory as to \\\"why he wants to travel through time.\\\" The treacly romance and the Lessons He Must Learn are enough to make film fans vomit.  The journey into the future is punctuated by a future disaster. OK, not bad, but it would have had more punch if we had been allowed to see that mankind just generally degenerates, as in the book. More a reflection of the times, I guess, as the George Pal version had a nuclear war take place.  The general story? Ugh. A total misrepresentation of the novel. The Eloi are too competent and warlike. The Morlocks are too intelligent. The UberMorlock is an embarrassment, and there's no setup. He just shows up in time to be killed. Yawn.  Samantha Mumba does OK. Guy Pearce is one of my favorites but he often seems confused and in pain. (Reportedly he broke a rib while filming this.) He also looks unhealthy and overly thin, as if he had been ill for a long time before making this.  A sad, sorry film version of one of the world's classics. H. G. Wells deserves better....MUCH better.  \", \"The 2002 version of \\\"The Time Machine\\\" is just the latest in a string of terribly disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face despite extravagant special effects.   What a lousy, uninspired bland story, with no imagination. Why so totally rewrite such a wonderful sci-fi classic? Are today's movie audiences too hip for the H.G. Wells writing largely as is? The 1960 George Pal version told a much more endearing story, even with clunky low-budget effects, beach-party looking Eloi, and Morlocks that looked like Smurfs on steroids.  The 2002 version must have H.G Wells turning in his grave:  1. The idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is an old sci-fi clich\\u00e9. This totally distracts from the love affair with Mara (what happened to Weena?!) that made the 1960 version so endearing. This sets an unfortunate and distractive tone early on that makes the whole movie dour. If Guy Pearce's character was so brilliant either he or his buddy Einstein would have realized the time paradox dilemma \\u0096 not have it dawn on him 800,000 yrs in the future \\u0096 from a Morlock no less, Doh!! What's wrong with time-traveling just for fun & adventure & curiosity -- as embodied in the 1960 version?  2. Only if you saw the first movie would you realize at all what Pearce was doing with the time machine when you first see it. The George Pal film carefully explains the whole weird idea of 'travel' though a 4th dimension.  3. The director goes out of his way to make Pearce's character look geeky, a worn out old stereotype of scientists. In the 1960 version Rod Taylor was a little nerdy too (at least around Weena) but managed to be swashbuckling, playful and charming.  4. Among the key themes of the 60's version -- abandoned in the remake -- is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. Blowing up the Moon to destroy humanity is pointless -- and doesn't do much for science literacy. For over 4 billion years the Moon has suffered vastly more powerful asteroid impacts, which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker. Yes, science fiction needs artistic license, but this is just plain dumb and meaningless.  5. Destroying the time machine is stupid too. Apparently our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing. Blowing up the machine to kill Morlocks is sort of a cop-out 'machina ex machina' Disappointingly, Pearce never comes back to the 1800s to tell his tale to his incredulous friends, a key part of the Wells story with the irony that in a week the time travels goes into the far future and back.  6. Having Morlocks running around in the daytime totally ruins H.G. Wells' wonderfully spooky, ghoulish portrayal of them as shadowy creatures of the night. A true cinematic opportunity lost. Also, Wells depicted the Eloi as frail and childlike. These guys in the movie looked like they could take on Morlocks, if they weren't such big baby wusses.  7. The one smart Morlock \\u0096 kind of a bleached-out Star Wars Evil Emperor -- had potential, but is so lame and aloof he tells Pearce to take his machine and go home ?! Boy, what a dramatic high point! In the book the Morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it, and fight to keep it.  8. The goof ball hologram at the N.Y. Public Library is too much. It makes light of the idea of human cannibalism. the 1960 version simply had the \\\"talking rings\\\" that delivered a chillingly somber eulogy for humankind. Derailed evolution is serious stuff.  Its sad the wonderful effects in this movie can never make up for a weary contrived clunker of a script. Save the cost of a ticket & popcorn and go rent the DVD when it comes out (soon no doubt), at least you can fast-forward thought the dull parts, just like our time traveler.\"], \"review_score\": [4, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], \"review_category\": [\"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 1.6923076923076923}, \"The Jacket\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0366627\", \"total_review_count\": 3, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"I thought this was a bad movie, and its box office totals certainly reflect that. This film wants us to believe that a doctor in a psych ward drugs his patients and then straps a weird jacket on them and puts them in a morgue drawer for a while. And all this allows the patient to time travel in his mind and apparently in reality. The doctor had no idea this would happen? Also, the film never told what type of results the doctor was expecting by putting a patient in a morgue drawer.  While in the drawer, it shows many close ups of Jack's eyes, then starts showing flashes of images. And then some how Jack winds up about 15 years in the future. During his first trip, he meets a girl, Jackie, who he remembers from his past. She doesn't know him. But, she picks up this stranger and lets him stay at her place? Not believable. And then later she sleeps with him?  Jack gets Jackie to help him investigate his death from 15 years earlier. He thinks it was foul play. Then there is a side plot of him helping one of the other doctors discover what is wrong with a sick child. Why was that part even in there? It just added to the confusion of the film.  FINAL VERDICT: I like films that have a story that makes sense and not so confusing. So, I don't care for this one and don't recommend it.\", \"An interesting concept with some very cool ideas that never really reaches its potential. Instead of exploring the implications of time traveling, the film sidetracks into a very rushed and hasty romance, one that never really makes sense. The scenes in the mental hospital add nothing new to the stock stereotype, and the ending is telegraphed a mile away. There are a few interesting ideas on time travel that are bandied about, but they ultimately go nowhere, and the military scenes at the beginning seem to serve no purpose for the rest of the movie. The story is flawed, but it's still interesting, the performances are great, and the visuals are kinda cool but nothing outstanding. An interesting concept turned into a decent film.  The thing that bothered me most was the entire point of Knightley's character Jackie. At first I just thought she'd be a sign to Jack that he's time traveling, but then she ends up helping him and being the love interest? How'd that happen? There's a rather large leap from her throwing him out of her place to her going out of her way to help him. It felt like there was a scene missing. In fact, all the scenes in the future seemed to ignore continuity and logic altogether. It was a bit disjointed, even for a sci-fi movie.  The ideas brought up by this movie on time travel have been discussed much better in other films and works of literature, so the film doesn't add much more to it. The movie's a decent watch, never causing you to lose interest, and the pace is perfect for this kind of film. It just doesn't seem to add up to anything special. It actually could have used a bunch more depth to it, to fill out the characters and inject some emotion and realism into the film. Still, it's an interesting movie, at the very least.\", \"(potential spoilers)  The theater was filled with people expecting what this picture could have potentially been if given more time to develop the story. Instead the audience got another story filled with quick cutaways and bass designed to give you a scare in that moment, but after leaving you with an emptiness where the story should have filled.  I will say this though, this movie didn't suck because of Adrien Brody. He was fun to watch and his subtleties didn't go unnoticed. A part that comes to mind is when he asks Kiera Knightly what year it is, she says 2007 and he gives his unbelieving, \\\"wha.\\\" Unfortunately the rest of the scene took place in bizarre 2007. What attractive 20 something female is going to bring to her apartment (where she lives alone) a mysterious Adrien Brody standing outside freezing. Her reason for letting him stay is that she called all the homeless shelters and none are open, so she'd feel guilty if she sent this guy she met 1 min ago away. \\\"You can sleep on my couch.\\\" Trusting aren't we. I didn't buy it. Also watching her vast array of facial expressions in this scene also brought a tear to my eye... from laughter.   I don't know about you but I'm so sick of films that use static and weird sound effects with shooting images to get the audience on edge. Ever since the Ring I haven't been able to appreciate them anymore and it looks more and more like a cheap thrill device. I was sitting in the theater waiting for those parts to be over.   All in all, the Jacket was a decent, unfinished story that had so much more potential. If it wasn't for Brody and a character named Mckenzie, this film would be a lot harder to watch. They tried to do something different, but didn't follow up.   4 (for effort) out of 10.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"There's Something About Mary\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0129387\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Thirteen Days\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0146309\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Thunderheart\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0105585\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Top Gun\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0092099\", \"total_review_count\": 3, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"This film was made way back in the Cold War days.

It couldn't miss--especially not without the face of then-current heartthrob Tom Cruise front and center. Still, the film more often than not resembles a hearty civil service recruitment ad (underlined with smug machismo), and is photographed and scored as such. Yes, it looks great, all expensive commercials do. Cruise doesn't act so much as he does strut, however this swagger doesn't help him much in the love-department as he is partnered with Kelly McGillis, playing a leggy, brainy instructor (she's too leggy and brainy for Tom, and seems far out of his league).

But regarding the story and dialogs I only can call it big crap. Nothing of that would happen like this on a real sailing vessel. No wonder, the film had bad impact on the existing ship - if I didn't know better, I wasn't tempted to do a sailing voyage for sure. Definitely, for Europeans I recommend to switch off once the ship ran aground. After that, the over-emotional, very American part begins which I couldn't bear. The pics are really, really great, no wonder in a Ridley Scott film, but if you can avoid listening to the text, it will become much better.\", \"The story, as I understand, is \\\"based on real events.\\\" That can be either good or bad, depending on what sort of license is taken with those real events and how they are rendered.

That is, what I figured was a coming-of-age movie along the lines of something about boot camp or basic training, the kind in which the drill sergeant says, \\\"My duty is to snap you out of your winsome civilian ways.\\\" Well, it IS that, in a way. The kids start out as kids and end up as an organic group. But this is far hokier than any boot-camp movie I've ever seen, outside of a deliberate comedy. Who WROTE this thing? The air is filled with slogans that belong, not in high school, but in the third grade. The dialog offends the ear.  Jeff Bridges usually does a better-than-average job but in this case his performance is mediocre. He brings nothing extra to the part, although given his lines, it's hard to know how he could do much with them. The rest of the cast is undistinguished and a few of the kids are painfully inadequate. There's a lot of tearing up, and considerable crying. The best scene involves a dolphin.  The immature clich\\u00e9s continue to the very end. The Coast Guard is cast in the role of the hard-hearted court at the hearing that follows the disaster. The interrogator does nothing but hit Bridges over the head with his misinterpretations and misconstruction of events. \\\"You let the crew drink alcohol, didn't you?\\\" (A couple of harmless drinks.) \\\"And you didn't punish them, though you punished them for killing a fish.\\\" (The dolphin business.) The technical details surrounding the sinking are left murky. What is a \\\"white squall\\\" anyway?

Mortal Kombat was pretty good (hated the PG-13 rating though). Resident Evil was just okay (rated R but just didn't have the feel). Now, we get Aliens Vs. Predator. Ever since watching the Alien and Predator films from the 80s and 90s, I was expecting something like this. Also reading the Dark Horse comics of these two rival foes was exciting. But, this movie did not live up to the standards of the previous films or the comics. I admit though, some elements did take place, but couldn't make up for the movie as a whole. So, what do we get? A simmered down version of our two favorites slapped with a PG-13?!! Fox should be ashamed. The movie had a cheap, rushed feel to it. Both franchises weren't done justice. Where are the marines? What happened to the fight on the other planet? This movie needed more time and possibly another director (James Cameron or Ridley Scott perhaps).  I'm not going to comment on the acting that much because this isn't a movie where dialog is superior to anything else in the movie. The two that really stood out were Sanaa Lathan and Big Boss Hogg Lance Henriksen (still going!!). Sanaa has strong standings to become a great actress. I wish her success in the future. Some of the dialog in the movie was laughably cheesy and unnecessary. Raoul Bova did alright too, but the rest of the cast was just there for the Alien and Predator killing satisfaction.  The CG effects in the movie were good and didn't throw the movie off at all. As a matter of fact, CG and some of the fight sequences saved the movie from being a big disgrace to the fans. The predator cloaking was great, and their weapons look more updated from the previous two predator movies. The editing was horrible though. Every time an Alien or one of the predators kill the scene was cut, and I mean CUT!! For those who haven't seen the movie, you will understand why a R rating needed to take place. A fight scene that took place in a chamber, between a predator and an alien, was badly edited. The camera was too shaky, and the lighting was displaced. Also, the slow motion BS is annoying. Besides the flaws, some satisfaction came out of the sequences.  Important: The predator should have been portrayed as being more agile and versatile in combat. The aliens should never get the upper hand unless the predator is outnumbered or wounded (READ THE DARK HORSE COMICS OR WATCH THE PREVIOUS MOVIES!!).  Overall, this is soaked down to just a decent popcorn flick. I hope that the dvd will acquire a R rating and add more valuable scenes to the movie. The theatrical version just doesn't cut. I wanted to see this more than Spider-Man!! Paul Anderson and company (FOX!! AARGH!!) let me down and also losing respect from me. Hope the sequel takes another turn (also possibly another director) and gives the fans a movie that we deserve.  Final Judgement: **/****  \", \">>>>>***SPOILERS GALORE----I JUST SAW THE MOVIE*****<<<<<  After just watching the movie...I have this to say.  I am a huge fan of the Alien series, and a pretty big fan of Predator. For an indicator of how long I have been a fan of the series, I will tell you first off that I saw Aliens when it came out on video tape in the late 80s and saw Alien 3 in theaters, I obviously saw Alien after its mid-70's release, and it scared me like few movies have ever been able to do since. I saw Predator later, and very much regard it as a good movie, in that it told a well thought-out story, had excellent characters, and an original plot, not to mention a great villain.  I believe a making a good movie means telling a good story, and telling it well. This movie has neither a good story, or, as it seems, a good story teller. What made Alien and Aliens stand out as excellent movies was the fact that Ridley Scott and James Cameron are superb story tellers, which means they make movies that resonate with the audience. The characters in the movie(AVP) are, at best, instantly forgettable, and the dialogue is stupid, unoriginal, and gives no indication any of the characters have a personality. Anderson makes a very feeble attempt to get you to care a little about Lex and Sebastian by giving them each(and a few other characters) painfully boring monologues about \\\"My dad died on a mountain, blah blah here, clich\\u00e9 line here, meaningless dribble there\\\", and letting them have(a few) more than 4 lines to read. What happened to good movies with memorable characters, good plot, and good dialogue? Are those times past us now? Since when does a single monologue pass as character development?  I have no idea of the names of any of the other characters whatsoever, except Charles Bishop Weyland. Which brings me to that point. Lance's character was horribly dry, unemotional, and when he dies, I didn't care, or even notice really. Not only that, the movie tells you nothing of his character, except you assume he is rich beyond all comprehension, and he does something with robots. Which to me, seems like just a passing, muttered excuse to have Lance Hendrickson in the movie. There is nothing even remotely clever about his wasted role, and no discernible relation to Bishop the android is made, only assumed, and definitely not explored or even attempted to explore. It also completely disregards the fact that in Alien 3, the man claimed he was the designer of the Bishop android...so...it just makes no sense, and it just kind of tries to spoon feed you that for some reason, this is the real creator, and not the guy in Alien 3, and doesn't ever even try to tell you why its right.  There are many many many wasted scenes, but one that particularly comes to mind is the sacrificial chamber scene. The scientists seemed to already know they were in danger when the eggs arose, although they should not have had any clue whatsoever about what the eggs were. They showed no curiosity, and immediately drew weapons, then were easily facehugged, and quickly spawned aliens, faster than in any earlier Alien film, literally within minutes of being impregnated there was an embryo bursting from the victims chest...which begs the question, why the hell would you bring weapons to a remote location in Antarctica, and not bring exploration or excavation equipment of any kind? I don't think automatic rifles(with laser sights) and 45 cal. automatic pistols are common equipment for an archaeological expedition. Makes no sense...and some of you may end up accusing me of nitpicking, and you're damn right, I expected a brilliant movie to rank with the works of James Cameron, Ridley Scott and John McTiernan because that's what was promised, and yes those movies are what I judge this one by. There was not a single scene in any of those movies that was blatantly unexplained, or was not logical in terms of the story. There was so very much that was illogical and wrong with this movie.  As for the Predators...of the three, two were brutally slaughtered very quickly, it seemed as if they had no chance at all. The Predator in the original movie was a fast, agile hunter that used clever tactics and stealth to quickly bring down an entire special forces unit, one at a time, in the heavy jungles of South America, by hand, alone. There were 3 of them in this movie, and it seems that the single predator in the first movie could have killed, not only all of the people in this movie by itself, but all three of the Predators in this movie by itself. These predators were slow, easily sneaked up upon, and had no seeming idea of what was going on, but just seemed to kill because that's what they felt like doing...or...something. In the original Predator, it was coming AFTER Arnold and his team, and there wasn't anything they could do about it. In this movie, the Predators just kinda...well...acted like guys in suits. The Original Predator could leap 20 feet in the air from tree to tree, these could kinda wobble around and run kinda. The Original Predator was like a ghost, these were just dead. And things just went from cheesy to outright goofy when Lex and the 'hero' Predator(who, without hesitation, murdered about 4 people a few minutes earlier) became friends and teamed up against the Queen...I thought they might even kiss at one point. And they even had a slo-mo running from danger scene reminiscent of...any movie where a big dude and his hot chick co-star triumphantly defeat whatever it was they're supposed to defeat, and are running from an inevitable explosion.  I basically take this movie as an insult, a spit in the face, of all serious fans like myself. The end is obviously open for a sequel...I say, bring back Ridley Scott or James Cameron for the love of all that is holy...because they are the only ones that could save this franchise now. I only wish they could have had a triumphant end, and not silly garbage like this.  RIP\", \"Okay, I'll confess that the only reason I registered at this site is to tell people how bad this movie really is.  AVP is embarrassing, the whole thing gives you the impression of an empty commercial exploitation on the well-known monsters images.  Anyone who comes to this kinda of review sites and gives this movie a 10 out of 10 is either a Fox films employee or related to the film crew somehow. Don't fall for it.  The whole idea of teen Predators hunting Aliens to become \\\"real warriors\\\" is idiotic. How can you compare a high tech civilization that is able to travel space to Indians? Okay, maybe It is possible they would have the same kind of ritual, after all why can't highly developed species have their rituals...  I was intrigued about how the first time a Predator blew itself up on top of the Pyramid it did not damage the construction at all.... Of course, the second time that another Predator did that, the whole thing fell apart.  It is laughable the friendship among the hero-chick and the teen Predator. I could almost see them holding hands and running away in the end of the movie. It turns out that the Predator developed feelings for her. I wonder why the Predators first came down from the sky shooting the hell out of the other guys who stayed in the abandoned whailing facility, no questions asked. Still wondering...  I didn't like the \\\"new\\\" Alien life cycle. The face-hugger burst out as an alien in 40 seconds. This is truly ridiculous. Anderson did not even take the time to watch the original Alien movie.  On top of that, the cast is composed by a bunch obscure nobodies in shallow roles. Even if they were any good, the lines they received would just have made them look as bad as they did.  As an Alien and Predator fan I felt I was disrespected. If you are too, you will know what I am talking about\", \"As we all know, Alien is one of the greatest Sci-Fi/Horror films ever to make it to the big screen, if not THE greatest. Its sequel, Aliens, turns the original classic into a roller- coaster ride that has became a classic in itself. Also a masterpiece, Predator has won a special place in my heart for the ingenuity of its antagonist, the Predator. In the sequel, you see the skulls of all sorts of other alien species the Predator has hunted, one of which happens to be the Alien. You're confronted with a wonderful idea: What if a movie was made involving the Predators hunting the Aliens? What an amazing idea! There's no way you could screw it up! Naturally, Hollywood found a way to screw it up.  It begins with a group of annoying people collected from all around the world. They have all answered a call by\\u0085 Bishop? The android? Anyhow, Bishop has discovered a pyramid located deep underground in Antarctica, and he wants a team to drill down to it\\u0085 oh, crap, where have I heard this before?  Fortunately for us, the Predators have been watching the movie from space, and they'd rather go for a little swim in the Aliens' acid-blood than sit through an Armageddon remake. To spare the entire world the torture, they fire a beam from space and make a hole leading right to the pyramid. See, they're not such bad guys after all!  Ah, crap. We go back to that stupid expedition team. They're exploring the pyramid and debating what civilization built it. It's half an hour into the movie. I check the DVD box. Hmm\\u0085 Alien. Predator. Vs. Maybe they labeled it wrong? This is looking suspiciously like National Treasure.  Uh-oh! They have disturbed the pyramid and the Predators are going in after them! \\u0085 maybe this is Predator 3? The pyramid shifts and the Alien eggs appear. Finally, a little Alien! But where are the Predators fighting them? Maybe the title should be \\\"Alien & Predator vs. Humans\\\", or perhaps \\\"Movie vs. Patience?\\\"  Well, about \\u00be of the way through, what remains of the expedition team (thankfully, only three) are running away from the Predator. One gets killed, and then the remaining two manage to escape when an Alien tackles the Predator. Whooo! Alien vs. Predator! Finally, it's\\u0085 over. Well, that didn't last very long.  After a few scenes which don't really matter, the female lead makes friends with the Predator. Wow, didn't see that coming. She kills the Alien rather than the Predator killing it. They go on to find the nest and reenact the ending of Aliens. The Predator dies, and a group of more Predators go on to reenact the ending of Predator 2. The end!\", \"What an awful film, I saw this cheap low budget pile of Markytson crap in a sleazy hotel that just happened to have room service. At first I thought I was insane and then I saw that this was an actual move. Holy crap! I mean, crapping in your pants and then eating dish-water and throw up is better than this movie, it seriously gives Alien and Predator bad names. Oh, and who wins??? Let us see... (the following has been voted by the stink-bag country America, thank god I'm in France!!) HERE WE GO!  Predator: Gay-fighting, Jamican guy with dreadlocks and a silver mask, the shirt he is wearing shows his nipples and he has claws that slash people to DEATH. Sorry, but Arnold was too busy misguiding California to help with this movie. Lance Henrikson, an acting legend, co-stars opposite in this film and guess what? He gets his throat slit. >_< Damn, I hate it when they do that. Trivia: Lance was in Aliens (an actual GOOD movie by James Cameron) and Alien 3 (a bit of a fail, though) He eventually wins because it turns out he was a \\\"good\\\" guy helping (WTF?!) the humans?...(Then an alien bursts out of his chest and he DIES)   Alien: One of my favourite movies is ALIEN, and ALIENS and ALIEN 3, I like Pieere's ALIEN 4 but it was not as good as the first three films. They made the aliens here pretty bad-ass, more bad-ass then normal. It really sucked to see the Predator win because I was rooting for the Aliens. The Alien-queen is blown up, even though she's already been blown up FOUR F-CKING TIMES!!!! Well, the aliens do some nice killings but the gore is way cheesy.   Overall: A HORRIBLE movie, bad bad bad. The tagline should have been: WHOEVER WINS, FOX GETS RICHER\", \"Paul WS Anderson has made a major achievement. He has made a film worse than \\\"Alien Resurrection\\\". AVP is a film for which I can think of a few people want Anderson shot for creating this rubbish. He tries to create tension by building up slowly but unlike Aliens where this worked , it just bores me stiff. He makes two massive mistakes with the film. Firstly the gore is gone in Great Britain this is the first \\\"Alien\\\" or \\\"Predator\\\" film not to be an 18, this shows as there is nothing worth even flinching at in the film.The second is that the film tampers with alien biology it actualty hurts. The only two major changes in almost twenty years were the addition of ridges on their heads in \\\"Aliens\\\" and the eggs being able to squirm in \\\"Alien Ressurrection\\\" Every other Aliens has the time between Alien embryo going in and chestburster coming out to be a day or so. Anderson turns this into mere minutes a shocking drop that makes me annoyed as a fan of the francise. I don't encourage illegal free downloads but that is the only way the purchace of this movie is a good price,a pathetic director at his most pathetic.\", \"Paul Anderson makes movies that start off incredibly well. Every time I see a Paul W. S. Anderson movie, I watch the first twenty minutes and think \\\"Hey, this might actually be good!\\\" He raises expectations, gets you excited, pulls out all of his best tricks... and then somewhere around 30 minutes in, it turns to garbage. If you think about it, all of his movies from Event Horizon to Resident Evil suffer from this malady. AVP is no exception.  In the opening scene, I watched an incredibly stylized alien-like silhouette turn into a satellite. And then it cut to a high tech lab, and then out to the desert, and then out to some glacier. As Paul Anderson assembled his team of protagonists, the movie had a distinct \\\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\\" or \\\"Jurassic Park\\\" vibe. In fact, now that I think about it, it had all the trappings of a Spielberg movie. The cherry on top of the sundae was when the wealthy tycoon Weyland, who was organizing the search party, turned out to be the actor who played \\\"Bishop\\\" in Aliens. I was on for the ride. I gripped my popcorn, I buckled in. I thought Paul Anderson had finally come into his own as a filmmaker... and he couldn't have picked a better time. Here was the unification of two of my favorite Science Fiction/Horror characters. If ever Paul Anderson was going to step up and be a real director, the time was now. I smiled, I squeezed my date's hand. This was gonna be great...  And then, it started to suck. Gradually at first, almost as if Anderson was thinking that if he just gave us a great opening we might forget about the fact that the rest of the movie was terrible. I figured things were going badly when the heroes enter a pyramid that they've found thousands (millions?) of feet beneath an arctic whaling station. Hokey, yes... but I'm still buying it. And then, our heroes venture inside this ancient edifice and are trapped inside the pyramid because they decided to take some Predator guns. You'd think these people never saw Raiders of the Lost Ark. I kept waiting for someone to bust out a bull whip. The only thing that was missing was the flying darts and the big boulder.  At this point in the movie, I got a really vivid mental picture of Paul Anderson standing in his living room, with DVD copies of Alien, Predator, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Cube laid out on the floor, and he's standing there taking a leak on all of them and laughing maniacally. I'm not kidding. That image flashed through my head.  Anyway, so when I finally shook myself out of it, there were people that were getting attacked by face-huggers that were bullet-timed a la the Matrix (and every other action movie since). I mentally added The Matrix to the DVDs on Paul's floor, covered with urine. These same people give birth to aliens a mere five minutes later. Suddenly the gestation period for aliens shortened by like three days. I think that might have made me angrier than anything. I just wanted to drive to Paul Anderson's house in the middle of the night, grab him and say, \\\"There are rules to think about here, Paul. Not a lot of them, but you do need to respect the movies that came before. I understand that it makes your job a little tougher because you want to tell a story about an alien, and you need to have it bust out of somebody's chest pretty early in the story... but you're getting paid a lot of money to figure out a clever way of making it work.\\\"  But even so, I kept watching. I had come this far, I needed to see the title bout. I watched clunky Predators with ridiculous dreadlocks fight with equally clumsy Aliens. All I could think was, \\\"Gee, I bet it's hot inside those suits.\\\" You could practically smell the latex. Still, there are some fun moments, so I keep watching.  And then the protagonist becomes best friends with a Predator and they go off to hunt Aliens together like Butch and Sundance. All of this comes at great expense as you are forced to watch our heroine playing a goofy game of charades with the Predator. When Predators start acting, you know you're in trouble.The end fight scene with the Alien Queen Mum is pretty good. I actually started to enjoy myself again in the last ten minutes of the movie. And then I remembered that I felt the same way about Resident Evil. That last shot with Milla in the city was great. It made me rethink my P.W.S. Anderson theory. Maybe he makes movies that begin and end really well, and then fills them with processed meat. If I ever choose to see another one of his movies, I'm going to walk out after twenty minutes, go get something to eat, and then come back for the last ten and see how I feel about it.\", \"Alien Vs. Predator has some cool scenes and some other entertaining moments but mostly the film is a disappointment. The fast-breeding creatures from the Aliens films take on the headhunting space colonizers from Predator in a battle for the earth, leaving a poor team of Antarctic archaeologist's and the rest of us lowly humans trapped in the middle. The plot does sound like it has potential and if it was rated R it could have been a lot better. The execution wasn't very good though since its just not very exciting. The death scenes are lame as you can't even see what's going on. Most of the action scenes are boring and that's a problem since that's one of the main reasons why a person may watch this film. The acting is terrible but its normal for this type of film. The most notable person in this film you might recognize is Sanaa Lathan but she of course doesn't add much to the film. The rest of the actors are of course bad and you have a better chance of laughing then being scared. The film is predictable because you know where its going and who's going to survive. The dialog is bad and funny but in a bad way, which is always a bad thing. Yet even with all this negativity I didn't completely hate it. Some of the action scenes were cool and its a pretty movie to look at, especially the creature special effects. Paul Anderson shouldn't be blamed as Fox wanted to edit the movie and make it earn more money. The films running time of 102 minutes feels a lot longer though. Rating 5/10 I had some fun watching this but this film is for hardcore fans only and even they will probably hate it.\", \"Well, I saw this movie for the first time today. I know, its been out for two years. Well, I heard all the bad press, and I didn't want to ruin two of my favorite franchises with one simple movie. But, I was bored, and decided that today, will be my day.  So, I watched it. Wow. I hate that I waited so long to see this movie. I put it off for two years, I should have seen it in the cinema.  Imagine hearing that someone was going to cut the skin off of your face. Now, imagine that you could have had it done right as soon as you heard about it, or you where given the choice to put it off for a couple years. Now, imagine waiting that two years, knowing that it's going to happen. Every day you just get one step closer to the worst pain you have ever felt in your life. Then the day comes, and as it is happening, all you can think to yourself is you should have gotten it done the day you found out, instead of waiting. Cause the pain is so much worse now.  That is exactly the way this movie was for me. EXACTLY the way it was. Well, maybe not exactly. This was actually worse than that! The plot had so many holes in it, I thought it was that pair of socks you have that you wear everyday, and have worn them since 1994, because they are you're lucky socks. Sure, they smell a little, and there isn't much cloth yet, but I can't just throw them away! Not only was the plot terrible, lets talk about acting, because apparently, they did not discuss it before casting anyone for this debacle! Cookie cutter lines muttered by people who's names you don't even know until they are about to die, and someone just screams their name saying \\\"God no! Please don't die! I've known you for five whole minutes! PLEASE GOD WHY! WHY TAKE....uhmm...Jonathon? FROM ME!!!! WHY!!!!!!!!!!\\\" And lastly, let's get down to the real subject matter. Aliens fighting predators. Seriously, how do you screw that up? You could have the two picking their noses and it would work. They could hold battle raps and it would be an entertaining fight (GROWL!!! SNARL SNARL SNARL!!! GURGLE GURLGE!!! YO MOMMAS A HOE!).  THERE ARE TWO FIGHTS IN THIS MOVIE!!! TWO!!! What? How do you get two fights in a movie that has a runtime of one hour and forty minutes? Wait, that is including the 12 minutes of credits, isn't it....yeah it is. Okay, one hour, twenty-eight minutes. TWO FIGHTS?!?!?!? And those weren't even that entertaining. Seriously, I told my friend to give me five minutes, and I bet I could come up with a plot outline that makes more sense and is a million times more entertaining. It took me all of thirty seconds to have an entire plot line written, and here it is for your pleasure:   Alien Vs Predator (the none sucky version)   Movie opens with a predator fighting an alien.  Then, more aliens come, and the fight starts to get real intense.  Then more predators come, and the fight gets insane.  This fight lasts for an hour and a half.  Predators win. The End.  Role credits.  BAM! See, you KNOW that is more entertaining. Now, Paul Anderson has made one really good movie, and two movies that were okay. Yes, he is a step above Uwe Boll...but still. How do you take the awesomeness that this movie could have been, and make a crap-fest of it all? Yes, crap-fest was the best I could come up with. The thesaurus didn't have anything under crap fest...except flapdoodle....which I considered for a bit.  Anyway, this movie sucks more than any sucking thing has ever sucked. I give it 1 star.\", \"Many people castigate Paul Anderson for destroying both the Alien and Predator franchises. I must say that they have no clue and the director/writer is a true genius for having pulled this movie off. Notice that I did'nt say that this movie itself was great but it was a work of genius. So what is the movie like? It is by far one of the worst and most disgusting pieces of crap that will kill your interest in both the Alien and predator. But don't you get it? That's the point.  Paul Anderson obviously hates the fans of the franchises and has been hating them for a while now. He hates them beyond anything and they must be made to pay dearly and suffer. So in a brilliant plan, he manages to fraud the fools at Fox to give him the project. He did that despite the fact that his previous movies were laughable. Now isn't that just genius? Anderson has made a joke out of every single thing that made the concepts stand out. Your innocent curiosity will make you sit through his parody in hopes of some big twist but it never happens. Scene after Scene is one joke after another. How can anyone possibly imagine a bullet-time mode for an Alien attack? All this has been done very intentionally and nobody realises that. Once you've watched this movie, there's nothing you can do about it. You've lost and Anderson has won. His revenge on fans is complete. Hes also left room for a sequel by including a predalien birth at the end, further putting a big hole in future stories. He makes a ton of money too. Genius.  Oh, I should have said EVIL genius.  UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR INTEREST IN ALIENS AND PREDATORS KILLED OFF, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\", \"well mainly that out of the 3 predators, two of them are killed easily, i mean watching them fight that one alien was like watching a 2 old child fight a lion. however the one \\\"main\\\" predator who is the biggest wuss ever to come from the predator home world because he has a soft spot for humans, well human, kills dozens with relative ease also, in aliens the acid burns through a lot of METAL floors, however this woman's face has developed the ability to with stand this potent acid? i therefore deduce that the woman is in fact a terminator, sent back in time for a completely irrelevant mission....at least my explanation makes more sense then the movie!\", \"This movie is the perfect epitome of Hollywood taking something beloved, running it straight to hell (Predator 2, Alien 4) and then taking it even one step further by completely disjointing the stories and continuity, *ahem* alienating the fans and basically wasting everyone's time while marring the original (Caddyshack 2 anyone??) all in the name of the mighty dollar bill. Seeing this movie only eggs them on people! This is a movie that you immediately wish you could UNWATCH and erase from your memory banks.  I would be highly surprised if more time went into the script of this film than the actual marketing. I'm not even going to complain about the PG-13 rating because it is what it is.... just a bad movie.  Horrible acting. Pointless plodding sub-plots. Decent action sequences and a precious few cool moments in what should have been a fan-boy's wet dream. The lead in this movie is a demographic friendly woman with barely enough acting ability to make a shampoo ad believable. Any mildly entertaining characters were immediately destroyed in the first twenty minutes of the film with zero payout. Even the marquee monsters end up looking bored as the audience is lead along in a by numbers popcorn sales ploy.\", \"AVP fails on several levels. It completely fails as an addition to both series, and it fails as a film itself. When I heard Anderson was in charge of this project, I knew that it couldn't be good news\\u0085.and then when the PG-13 rating came along, my fears were multiplied and confirmed. A huge fan of both series, I wanted more than anything to like this film and for it to at least be average. After all, I cannot think of many film ideas that have had more potential. This very well could have been the best action and sci-fi film ever created, only if it had a decent director. I actually gave Anderson a chance, a 10% chance of making an average film, and a 0% chance of making it into what it deserved and had the potential to be. Those who gave him more should be embarrassed. I'm embarrassed that I paid to see it, however, I have a unique way of justifying it. Since I paid for it, the only way I can redeem myself is to rip this excuse for a film apart in this review, which will be long, and tell everyone I know how much this film completely sucks and how the originals and all copies should be burned.  MASSIVE spoilers:  First off, it fails right off for having a weak and unbelievable story, all thanks to the brilliantly moronic Anderson. Full of holes. An ancient pyramid, reminiscent of the Cube, 2000 feet below the ice in Antarctica? Riiiiiight. Predators have hunted humans for years, so let's send some adolescent ones to go after the fiercest species in the universe, and hey, let's only have them do it every 100 years\\u0085.Riiiight. A chained up Queen Alien that's also been frozen and imprisoned by some wimpy ass Mongoloid Predators that get schooled like little b*tches? Riiiiight. A Predator and a woman make friends and the Predator even makes a shield and spear for her out of an Alien carcass? Oh-f-ing-KAY! I'll stop, but it doesn't take a film professor to see where this is going. They might as well have put an Alien Predator sex scene in it. So much potential and this was what Anderson shat out.  Anyone with even a lick of respect for either franchise can see how utterly stupid this film was even before any production was set forth. It gets even worse. Why in the hell would you claim to be a fan of both franchises and then go against many things we know about both creatures and make yourself look like a fool? Easy, Anderson is a fool. Face-huggers now fall off within minutes of attachment, the gestation period for the chest-bursters is now also a few minutes\\u0085.and, to top it all off their blood is only sporadically acidic. How's that for consistency? Want more? Why in the hell would Predators set up an entire human civilization to perpetuate their ritual Alien hunts and bring weapons with them that melt when they come in contact with Alien blood? If these things have been hunting Aliens for hundreds of years, you'd think they'd be smarter than that.   And while we're at it, let's change the way the Predators and Aliens look. The Preds in this film look like they have down syndrome with their masks off. The fact that they look like linebackers doesn't help either. The original in 1987 looked infinitely better and more realistic, not like some lumbering oaf in a rubber suit. And just to make them fiercer, as if it were needed, let's make the Aliens so that they can open their mouths as wide as a Muppet, particularly Guy Smiley, can. This is the material we waited 14 years for?! I actually felt sorry for the Predators in this movie, they're just sad. On top of looking like they rode in on the short ship, they get their asses KICKED. Colonial Marines did better against a HIVE of Aliens than the Preds did against a few running around\\u0085.and these were friggin' Predators!!! I thought the Predators hunted the ALIENS? These Preds were sissies, and were about as stealthy as a rhino giving birth during an electrical storm. Utterly ridiculous.   The cinematography used is entirely out of place. The quick-cut editing used during the fight scenes is some of the worst I've seen to date. You can't see anything that's going on and you might as well not even see the fights at all. That's exactly what I was looking forward to after 14 years, especially in a film with 'Vs.' in the title. While some of this may be possibly attributed to the studio axing it to make it PG-13, the shots that are left are far too close to the action, leading me to believe that this may have not been the studio's fault as some Anderson supporters claim. It's truly confusing and annoying. Straight out of The Blair Witch Project. And let's not forget to throw some Matrix bullet time into a face-hugger sequence, we'd be lost without that. And for a film that is obviously meant to be action-packed, it certainly isn't. Half of its measly runtime is spent setting up this ridiculous scenario. Where is the damn epic showdown?! This was a Versus movie right?  End of 'spoilers'.  And to all of you people defending this film, what in the hell are you thinking? Just because you're a fan of both franchises doesn't mean you have to swallow this and embarrass yourself on these pages. We deserved more. If you are OK with this film and do find it enjoyable, you are completely void of any taste in film. I simply do not understand your mediocrity.  For having more potential than almost any film in the last decade and releasing this stank pickle, I give AVP 1/10. R.I.P. Alien and Predator.\", \"If you give a toss about the story, stop reading. But believe me, this comment couldn't possibly ruin the film for you any more than Fox has. Spare a thought for Paul Anderson as he struggles to make a film that hasn't been neutered by the MPAA or a cowardly studio. Once Paul Verhoeven left America to resume his stellar work in Europe, I guess the MPAA had to have someone to pound upon. After moronic parents who took their single-digit-age children to see Resident Evil complained, I guess it was inevitable that future Anderson projects face an even bigger butcher's knife.  But I am getting ahead of myself here. There are two things that made the Alien and Predator franchises work. The first was human interaction. In essence, the films were about humans trying to screw each other over for power, with the titular enemy there to deliver the consequences of not working together. A non-subtle and somewhat shallow social statement, in other words. Then there's the gore factor. Once the human drama is set up, who cannot help but feel for the survivors as a marine's face is melted by Alien blood, or when a train full of commuters are torn to pieces by a Predator who doesn't fully understand what is going on around him?  AVP tries to set up the former factor with Lance Henriksen's character anxious to find the strange artefact under the polar cap before he dies. Unfortunately, where Aliens in particular excelled was that it managed to give every character a third dimension. Here, only Henriksen's character gets such effort. So every act of violence or mayhem is given a feeling of absolutely no consequence. It's almost like a video game.  Paul Anderson is on record as saying that he made the film with every intention of it being screened with the MPAA's R rating. Apparently, Fox, fearing it will alienate children, decided otherwise. Never mind that the audience which kept both franchises in the black are now either in their mid-twenties or middle-aged. Forget creativity or making something that people might enjoy. The lowest common denominator rules here. Those parents who complained when the studio didn't accommodate them because they were too stupid to realize a film based on a video game which is in turn based on Night Of The Living Dead might not be a good babysitter, I hope you are proud of yourselves. Meanwhile, if any studio wants to let Anderson make a film without tying his hands over his audience's eyes, I will gladly pay to see it multiple times. Trust me, you will make more money this way once backlash is accounted for.  AVP also marks the first Anderson film I have seen in which the shaky-cam technique is used. Here, they don't even bother to try and make their excuse that it puts the audience more into the action seem plausible. Every shaky-cam frame might as well have the phrase \\\"we are shaking this camera to preserve our PG-13 rating\\\" stamped across it in big, bold letters.  You may have noticed that I haven't said anything about the actual characters yet, apart from mentioning Lance Henriksen by his own name rather than that of the character. There is a reason for this. If a group of film characters became any more generic, they could all be played by the same actor. The Aliens and Predators do not fare any better. Seriously, why on Earth didn't they just base the script upon the first comic book series? These comic books showed more for the audience to get interested in with one issue than this film shows in its entire running length.  The story also shows every conceivable sign of not being thought through. The humans discover an alien temple a couple of thousand feet below the surface of a polar cap. Great, but wouldn't that mean it is basically submerged in the ocean? So when the intrepid humans decide to go and check it out, the Predators oblige them by firing a beam from Earth's orbit into said polar cap, tunneling the thousands of feet needed to find the entrance. I guess the budget cuts at NASA meant that nobody could notice the massive hulking ship above the Earth. I'm also guessing that Alien blood and armour made from Alien parts gives one special powers, such as the ability to stand below a spacecraft as it takes off without being burned by the thrust. Or did they just not see Danny Glover's race to get away from the Predators' ship at the end of Predator 2?  In short, this film insults the fans of both franchises, sci-fi action fans in general, as well as the basic principle of adults being able to watch and hear what they choose to. I strongly urge the viewing, DVD-buying public to give this film the butt, lest more be made in this kindergarten-oriented fashion. Fox, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.\", \"Many fans want different things from this film. Many fans, including myself, were hoping to see lots and lots of action. One Alien & Predator battle after another. Some fans were hoping for a edge of your seat, truly terrifying horror movie much like the original Alien. No matter what you want, hope, or expect from this film you will be disappointed.  The direction this film takes is a horror route. It tries to be like the original Alien movie in the sense that the horror has to come more from the characters and their fear than from the monsters themselves. Paul Anderson tries to show as little Alien & Predator as possible without being ridiculous and let the actors & characters sell us the fear. Now this sounds like a good approach to a film and normally it would be. Here however it is the reason the films fall flat on its face. The problem being is that the characters aren't interesting and their actually paper thin cut outs. And after a short while the characters become boring and un-interesting and then u begin to long for either an Alien or a Predator to show up and start killing people.  But as I said, Paul Anderson tries to hide the monsters and show as little as possible much like the formula Ridley Scott & James Cameron used for their films. And thats where the film fails. Fans come to see this movie to see Aliens & Predators fighting. They don't come to see Sanna Lathan and the other people run around a dark pyramid. Fans didn't wait 14 years to see paper thin characters run around all over the place. They go to see Aliens & Predators.  The film should have taken the action route and gives us large amounts of AVP battles. However Paul Anderson only gives us ONE, count them One, true fight scene between an ALien & predator. And that fight scene doesn't occur until half-way through the film and it only lasts 2 minutes. 2 minutes. As a fan I did not wait this long to see a AVP movie only to have one battle that lasts 2 minutes.  Above I said \\\"true battle\\\" because there is technically another battle. It is between a Predator, Lex, and an Alien Queen. Much like the first AVP battle it is disappointingly short and 90% of the battle focuses on lex fighting the queen than it does focus on the Predator. After a while you begin to think the title \\\"Alien vs. Predator\\\" is inappropriate and instead should be called \\\"The Adventures of Lex\\\". Paul Andersons direction leaves out the two title characters.  The idea of hiding your monsters appearance till half way through the film and rely more on your characters is a formula that has worked in the past. It even potentially could have worked here but in order for that to happen you need to do one thing. Make the characters more interesting. If your characters are paper thin then the audience aren't going to care about them and then they quickly become bored. The film should have done is focus less on characters and more on the monsters. It amazes me so much on how the film lacks on what the title promises.\", \"Paul W. S. Anderson, the man who has directed previous travesties as \\\"Mortal Kombat\\\" and \\\"Resident Evil\\\" doesn't fail to live up to his standards which consist of a horrible script, cheesy \\\"2 kewl 4 skool\\\" directing styles, weak cast, and every other weakness in a film you can think of. The only person who rivals his ineptness is none other than Uwe Boll. He has already ruined other franchises with his previous films, and now by directing and writing Alien vs. Predator, he has managed to ruin two movie series at the same time.  The story of this film is bay far the weakest aspect of this derision of a movie. All the previous Alien/Predator films had simple plots with good dialogue. Just simply there was a monster trying to kill the good guys, and they had to survive it. The stories were so uncomplicated yet incredibly well written that the viewer could not possibly complain that the story was bad. Alien vs. Predator however attempts to be a big, complex story with deep meaning to it, but it just comes off as being stupid and try hard. Paul, a complex story is good, only if you know how to write that is.  It's about a pyramid that is discovered on Earth in Antarctica. It turns out that this pyramid was part of the first human civilisation ever, that the Predators built it for the humans long ago, and in return, the humans worshiped the Predators as gods and acted as hosts for the captive alien Queens eggs that are in the pyramid, to make Aliens for the predators to hunt, not for sport like in the previous Predator films, but to prove that they are men. When modern day people go to investigate this pyramid, they become the new hosts for the Aliens that they Predators are going to hunt.  Not only is this completely unbelievable, (a pyramid in Antarctica? Come on) but it totally contradicts the previous Alien and Predator movies. In each Alien movie the point of the film was, \\\"Don't let the Aliens get to Earth or they will kill everything!\\\" Yet in this movie it was like, \\\"Oh the Aliens have been on Earth the entire time and it wasn't really that bad now that we think about it.\\\" The previous Predator films are contradicted as well because the Predators are portrayed as creatures who are noble warriors, who actually respect humans and will help them if need be, rather than the ruthless merciless hunters who killed for sport and would kill a human just out of spite if he looked at him funny. Having Predators help humans build societies contradicts their nature, and takes away the mysteriousness and awesomeness of the Predator character.   But the thing is even as a stand alone film it's a very weak story. It can be compared to the later Jaws movies where you saw too much of the shark. Both extraterrestrial species are too in your face and have no mystery; leaving them just look like guys in rubber suits running around punching each other. Human characters have so little character development that often you don't even get to learn their names before they are killed, and so much more makes you feel like the script was made from a tipped over box of alphabet cereal.   Here's a perfect example of how bad the dialogue is in AVP.   FemaleTechnician: What is it?   Male Technician: It's a data stream from PS12.  Female Technician: Where is she?   Male Technician: Right above sector 14.   Female Technician: There isn't anything in sector 14.   Male Technician: The is now.  It is obvious in that piece of dialogue that Paul W. S. Anderson doesn't know anything about mapping or geography. Look moron, there is no such thing as this elusive \\\"sector 14\\\", things are mapped using latitude and longitude, bearings and such. Secondly for this Female Technician to have said on the spot, \\\"There's nothing in sector 14\\\" implies that she has memorised the presumably thousands of sectors all over the world and what is in each and every one of them so she can recall instantly off the top of her head that the isn't anything in sector 14. This is just one example of how cheesy and full of holes the very dialogue in Alien vs. Predator can be.  It is clear that a movie this bad was made only for the action, not the story. The thing is, in this whole move THERE ARE ONLY TWO FIGHT SCENES! If you are going to make a movie that has no good script which is only about the action, put in a decent amount of fighting at least!  AND THE PG-13 RATING?! Every other Alien/Predator film released before this one had and R rating. This film has been dumbed down for kids so much, that about 95% of the movies deaths or other injuries were off screen. You would see an Alien just getting near a guy before the camera would cut away, leaving you thinking, \\\"So not only do we have no story but we have no gore?! I want my money back!\\\" The line \\\"You are one ugly mother f\\u0097er\\\" which is the trademark line of each other Predator film had the last word of it not filmed to keep the low rating! Yet earlier in the film they said, \\\"I hope it kills every f\\u0097ing one of them!\\\". Why did they decide to put the F word in earlier when it wasn't necessary, yet cut it out later when it was?! If they had of just shifted the F word to the ugly mother part then there could have been just as many F words yet still kept the trademark line!  It's a POS movie. The 1000 word limit has stopped me from going on.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"All About Eve\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0042192\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"All the President's Men\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0074119\", \"total_review_count\": 1, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"I've always wanted to see this movie but never got round to it.

Andy saves Serafine Pigot (the gorgeous Julie Delpy) from committing suicide in Eiffel Tour and has a crush on her. He does not know that she is a werewolf. They go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves. Andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf. He is advised that the only way to become normal again is killing the werewolf that attacked him and eating its heart. This movie is a violent black humor movie. The special effects and the soundtrack are excellent, highlighting the song of the band Bush. I do not know why some readers compares this movie with the masterpiece 'An American Werewolf in London'. The stories have nothing in common (only an American teenager, werewolves and a city in Europe). Highly indicated for fans of werewolf and black humor movies. My vote is seven.  Title (Brazil): \\\"Um Lobisomem Americano em Paris\\\" (\\\"An American Werewolf in Paris\\\")\", \"Is it full moon tonight? OH! It doesn't matter they can change whenever they want cuz of that drug! What was I thinking if its full moon tonight?! Geez  I really like this movie, there's romance, suspense, horror, and hot stuff ;) I like the first half of the movie when the guy saves the girl from killing herself by bungee jumping and catching her. That was really cool. The setting of this movie is in the city of love which is Paris in France. The cemetery scenes are nice, it gives you chills not knowing what will happen there or who's behind the walls. The scenes that makes you jump out of your seat is really cool. Even they got me on that scenes. His friend who died and the girl whom he killed in the cemetery but still shows themselves to the lead character(sorry I forgot his name), was really funny. The actors did a good job plus the make-up crews. The part when they're all partying in an abandoned church, I can't believe people would that because even though that's an abandoned church, that is still God's house. I bought this movie long time ago, and I do not regret buying it. I'm a horror-movie-lover. I give this movie 5 stars out of 6. For the people who are open and loves movies like this, give it a try, you might like it.\", \"this movie is not as bad as some say it is infact i think it`s more enjoyable than the original . maybe that`s why some people hate it as much cos they dont want to admit it`s a good (not great) movie.  most if not all fx were done by C.G.I which i didn`t mind at all cos it was an enjoyable movie. Phil Buckman - (Chris) was in my opinion the best guy in the movie Julie Delpy was rather attractive she brought the sexiness to the movie.  there were a lot of wisecracks in the movie which i thought were good. this movie is in my collection but the original is not because i dont like it as much as this one. i was not bored when i watched this movie it kept me watching unlike some horror movies i could mention like oh say = driller killer & suspiria (dario argento`s movie) thats to name but two.  this is an ok werewolf film it should be in people`s collection if they like werewolf movies maybe i`ll get the original at some point maybe. i have only one complaint and that is Phil Buckman - (Chris) should have been in it more than he was but apart from that the movie was fine.  rating for this movie 8/10 an ok werewolf movie not the worst one out there.  \", \"I have never seen \\\"American Werewolf in London\\\" but this movie was very entertaining. When renting it I thought it was a horror movie but it turned out to be more of a comedy with some horror aspects. I thought the transformation sequences were nicely done but effects wise, the best scenes were those where the effects and the lighting built off each other, nice. The transformations reminded me a lot of werewolf transformations in other movies, but the werewolves themselves are very beastly and not very dog like. Gore: i do believe there is too much in this movie, which really takes away from the horror, when every frame has blood in it, taking the violence seriously is hard.   J.Hurst (8th grade)\", \"OK, most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake, but at the same time it's also a different movie in its own right. Don't get me wrong, 'American Werewolf In London' is a superior film, but 'American Remake In Paris' is a decent movie as well.  First off, the only real similarities are the TITLE, 2 American BACKPACKERS, and WEREWOLVES. Other than those 3 things, 'American Remake In Paris' stands apart fairly well on its own with its special blend of humor, action/adventure, and horror. Most of the people who say this film is better than the original are the youth of today's generation that think any movie made before 1990 is total crap. While those of us who grew up in the 80's can appreciate older films and what they have added to the horror films of today. What a lot of people fail to realize is that without the old classic films, including the B&W ones, horror wouldn't be what it is today. Now I'm getting a little off the beaten path...  An American Werewolf In Paris is a good attempt at re-creating a classic, but it will never surpass the original, ever. With that said, this is still a very entertaining film to watch and I do recommend it. I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. Maybe that's being a little generous, but I've seen much worse attempts at trying to re-create a classic.\", \"I just finished a double feature night of An American Werewolf in London & Paris. Let me start by saying \\\"London\\\" still holds up after all these years and the transformation sequence is by any standard quite impressive, the film was funny, and scary, also a bit of gore....Now lets get to \\\"Paris\\\" its enjoyable, a few scars, lots of gore not as exciting or eerie as original but it does have a few laughs in what has become quite the fashion these days in films so maybe in that sense it was ahead of it's time, the transformations al'a CGI while good for the technology of its time are nowhere near as impressive as the original. I gave this movie a 7 because I have to admit it was enjoyable, I laughed a lot and found Tom Everett Scott to be so silly that at first I wanted to dislike his performance only to end up liking it...go figure...Julie Delpy was competent as was the direction it's the script that lacked a bit of shine & finesse. I read here that John Landis was supposed to direct to bad he didn't I am quite sure it would have been a different movie altogether. I also noticed some discussion of a Sequel \\\"What If\\\" well no one has noted the Obvious it should be in American and here is my title \\\"An American Werewolf Comes Home\\\" or in DC that would be fun all those political dogs need a good scare. You simply must see the original in it's new DVD transfer with dolby 5.1 sound and see both of these on an HDTV with upconvert turned on...nice!!!!\", \"The title suggests that this movie is a sequel to \\\"An American werewolf in London\\\". None of the characters from the previous movie return and aren't even mentioned in this movie by name. So as a sequel, AAwiP fails, one would say.  I dare to say the opposite.  An American werewolf in Paris is a charming, effective horror movie. It's one of the better werewolf films I have seen in a long time too. And I have seen quite my share, such as An American werewolf in London, The Howling, Wolfen, The Wolfman and the Underworld trilogy.  The story tells of three Americans visiting Paris on a vacation. At the top of the Eifel Tower one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide. What starts out as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealed...  I really liked the acting in this film. Especially the two stars of the movie: the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her. They have good chemistry together. But the other two Americans also play their roles nicely. I didn't really find anything annoying about the acting, so thumbs up for that!   The effects on the werewolves are nice. It doesn't look too cheap or fake to me. Of course, the opinions are divided about this subject. But let's just say that I wasn't disappointed.  There's also a good amount of humor in this movie. There are some really funny scenes you will probably remember for a long time.  So, to sum it up, An American werewolf in Paris might not be a direct sequel to it's predecessor, but it's still an enjoyable movie. Perfect for fans of werewolves! 7 out of 10 stars!\", \"Three American lads are backpacking their way around Europe, challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and Hot babe lays as they can, But Andy seeks true love. He finds this during their bungee-jump attempt on the Eiffel Tower, when he comes across and breathtakingly saves a suicidal and heart-burstingly beautiful Julie Delpy. His attempts to find this girl and the secret he uncovers lead he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action, romance, gore, and inspired humor, without ever taking itself to seriously, or striving to be anything other than a wildly entertaining 90 minute ride. I have seen this film a number of times and found it a much more rewarding experience than the 'London' original, although both films are so different it is not fair to compare the two or even to consider this a sequel.\", \"I have mixed emotions about this film, especially as it compares to its forerunner,  \\\"An American Werewolf In London.\\\" That film had it's funny moments, it was still more of horror tale than anything else. This updated version, now set in Paris, does not have that \\\"edge\\\" at all and simply isn't in the same class....but it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall it's still fun to watch.   So, \\\"werewolf purists\\\" aside, most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the London version, I'll still give it decent marks since I don't care what others think. I liked it even though I agree \\\"London\\\" is better and I prefer that version, too.   The first 30-40 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a \\\"balloon\\\" in a restaurant. It also introduces the lead female character, played by Julie Delpy. I don't see enough of this actress. She doesn't seem to make that many films, or least ones I hear about over here in America. This French actress has a face that is classic beauty, so the film got points for having her in it, and she looks great.  When the horror starts, it can get scary and the special effects are good. I also liked the lack of profanity in this film, unlike the first one: no f-words and no Lord's name in vain - amazing!  However, there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me. The soundtrack is heavy metal which isn't appealing to a middle-aged guy like me, either. This film is geared a lot more toward 20-somethings, if that helps anyone.  It's entertaining.....just don't expect it to live up to the first film.\", \"An American Werewolf in London had some funny parts, but this one isn't so good. The computer werewolves are just awful: the perspective is all off, it's like seeing them through a distorting mirror. The writers step on the throat of many of their gags. American boy says to Parisian girl, \\\"Is there a cafe' around here?\\\" Instead of just leaving it at that, they have to have the girl sigh and respond, \\\"This is Paris.\\\"\", \"This film probably would have been good,if they didn't use CGI (computer generated imagery)for the werewolf scenes.It made the creatures look fake and the werewolves looked cartoonish.CGI is great for certain effects like the dinasours in Jurassic Park or Twister.But when we see a film where the creature must look completely real,CGI is not the way to go.Look at An American Werewolf in London.No CGI.Just makeup and a mechanical creature and what you come up with was more realistic than what was shown in the sequel.This film did offer a few gags that was fun to watch and the humor in this movie seemed to have drawn me in but it's nothing more than a film that I thought was O.K.And that's not good enough.In my opinion,An American Werewolf in Paris doesn't hold up to the original.\", \"An American Werewolf in Paris wasn't really that good compared to the original.The original didn't use computer effects for the werewolf and they looked more realistic .The werewolf effects in this film looked too cartoonish.most of all,the movie did not have enough for me for a horror film to enjoy.\", \"There is really but one thing to say about this sorry movie. It should never have been made. The first one, one of my favourites, An American Werewolf in London, is a great movie, with a good plot, good actors and good FX. But this one? It stinks to heaven with a cry of helplessness.  \", \"This is a title in search of a movie. It's a pitch that sounded lucrative to some studio executive and the rest be damned. When this film was made there were still two things that CGI did not do at all well: people, and fur. Furry people were thus not destined to look good when rendered by computer. This is the only example I can think of where effects for a well-funded sequel took a giant leap back landing well behind those of the original movie. For the record, the design of the werewolves doesn't help a bit. The film-makers apparently couldn't decide between quadruped and biped, tried to do both, and wound up with a creature that looks equally awkward either way. The transformations are anatomically nonsensical and the end result with a relatively high forehead and short snout looks like a cross between Ron Perlman and a hyena. But back to the crass part. This is a movie which exists PURELY to cash in on its forebear. I am not a fan of Landis' original film but boy, does it look good in light of this. If you thought some of Landis' humor was forced try some of the excruciating attempts here. The bubble gum scene, the corpse humor, the dog that...you know, you'll just have to watch that bit yourselves. Thomas Everett Scott is on vacation in Europe with friends and decides to take a break from acting the \\\"ugly American' and bungee jump off the Eifel Tower in the middle of the night.

She turns out to be part of a cult of werewolves who are plotting to...I'm not sure, something bad. Ghastly French stereotypes, gaping plot-holes, a muddled ending.

Actually, to be quite honest, it didn't impress me at all.  Tom Everett-Scott and his dude pals are wandering Paris and, in a preposterous bungee stunt off the Eifel Tower, rescuing wolf-babe Julie Delpy from death. Before you've time to work out if the constant mugging and lumpy dialogue is meant to be the stuff of comedy, a full-moon has hit and the brats are being chased by dreadful CGI werewolves down Parisian sewers.  The script is disgustingly poor, the actors were made to make this film, they're horrible performances match the status of the movie. From start to end, this movie is never entertaining, engaging or even slightly watchable. I had trouble watching this whole film without throwing up my dinner, to be quite honest.  The action scenes aren't exciting, the jokes aren't funny and the werewolves aren't scary. In short: Miss out or be haunted forever.  I rate An American Werewolf in Paris 2 out of 10.\", \"Well, what can be said about a \\\"horror comedy\\\" that features neither horror nor comedy? There are no characters in the film, but much too many plot lines - all underdeveloped and mostly superfluous.

The walking dead are the biggest rip-off apart from the title, the shall look like the dead in Landis' movie, but are far removed. They just look like bad actors with abit of plastic and bull's blood added.  Two plot lines really showed some promise (the love story and the \\\"company\\\" story), but failed as miserably as the director, the writers, the SFX department, the production and the actors.\", \"This DVD is missing its calling as a Heineken coaster.... This is a great example of why no one should ever go see a sequel with a different director/writer than the original. Two hours of this turkey left me begging for Exorcist 2 reruns.   NO legitimate laughs. NOT ONE decent scare. The script was just a mess and I felt bad for the actors who had to perform it (they must have had sick relatives at home or monster coke habits or something).  The original was a makeup effects landmark. So naturally, the producers of the sequel thought it would be a great idea to to scrap makeup FX and do CG werewolves instead. These CG werewolves had me laughing a lot harder than any of the \\\"comedy\\\". It was just a total miss. If ya want a night's entertainment, go rent the original again. Or go take a film class and make your own horror film. You're bound to do better than these fools did.\", \"The odd mixture of comedy and horror sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Had the main male character been a little more interesting, the film would have been as well. A trio of young Americans visit Paris, run into a beautiful werewolf, and the problems confound from there.  Numerous logic holes make the possibly intriguing story difficult to take.\", \"I was a fan of the AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON movie and so was curious whether a 16-year later sequel could be done with French language and local re-cast major, supporting, and minor characters. Tonight I watched the \\\"edited for FOX Network\\\" version that was some sort of curious hybrid of several hyperactive sequels. The screenwriters and directors pay homage to certain of the key plot concepts: Tourist gets wolf bite, full moon comes out, boy meets girl, boy becomes beast, boy dies heroic death after help from ghost victim. For me, the oddest aspect of this \\\"formula\\\" teen horror special effect-ride was the casting of the school teacher-love interest of the TV comedy \\\"ED\\\" as one of the werewolf's clueless victims who is more or less totally unsympathetic in the scripted lines they handed her. I haven't seen another horror-flick that this movie is \\\"sequelling\\\" (a vampire fighting flick titled BLADE), but I guess that parts of its plotline must explain how villain werewolves (they're spoofish) are threatening the \\\"good\\\" werewolf pair during a long part of the movie. There is also a final conflict in a Paris subway train, a la SPEED. This 1997 studio product is an odd hybrid of a film since considerable technical effects are shown for scary purposes but the authentic terrors of the original have been completely undermined, in my opinion. Such an odd re-write of the werewolf legend and \\\"movie-mythology\\\" !?! My suggestion to those considering this at the video store -- go for a classic \\\"top of the line\\\" Thriller instead : Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO!\", \"Perhaps I'm being too generous when I give this film two and a half stars out of five, but there was an occasional moment. However, as \\\"An American Werewolf\\\" movie this one is a missed chance! There are no real plot connections to the superior original to speak of, but the story is similar in some ways to \\\"London\\\".  *Possible Spoiler Warning* American kids go to foreign country, one falls in love with a beautiful girl. Another one of the kids gets slaughtered by a werewolf in the same night that one gets bitten, and despite his undead friend's warnings, by the light of the full moon he sprouts fur, fangs, and claws!  But there are some differences in the story, for one; the girl is one of the werewolves. Second; there are three American Kids. And third; there's some weird-@$$ werewolf cult intent on taking over the world! As crazy as it sounds, that last one, WASN'T a joke! *Spoiler Ends*  The films suffers from many things, first the weak acting drags it down immensely! Tom Everret Scott's performance is amatuerish at best, and he and Julie Delpy, who plays his love interest, don't seem to have any chemistry together at all. Second; A weak script that seems to be all over the place. Many elements of suspense and dark comedy, that made the original one great, are missing in this one. And whoever said that eating out the heart of the werewolf that bit you will change you back human? Last I heard this wasn't part of werewolf lore at all! Third; terrible special effects; The werewolf effects are done with computer animation, which works for things such as dinosaurs, ghosts, and space ships. But seems choppy, fake and artificial, when used for furry creatures like werewolves.  However there were a few things that saved this one from total \\\"turkeydom\\\", there's one hilarious scene in a Paris cafe when Andy (Scott) is having coffee with Serafine (Delpy), he drops a bunch of condoms on the table, and tries to pass them off as chewing gum, by chewing and blowing a bubble! Also; the soundtrack, a very cool mix of alternative rock bands like Bush and Smashmouth. Although none of the songs have the word \\\"moon\\\" in their title, like the original movie, the soundtrack is great nontheless. And another funny scene when a rotting corpse, played by Julie Bowen, attempts to whistle and her eyeball pops out, had me laughing out loud.  But as a whole this film seems to lack the wit and suspense of the original. And the overly contrived ending doesn't help it out much either.  **1/2 Two and a half Out of Five Stars (Average.)\", \"God, that sucked. You can't end a horror movie with a happily-ever-after family setting. Yeash. I was kind of ambivalent going in to the final act. But, my god.

What a hunk of junk. This is the worst horror movie I've seen in a long time, and I've watched a lot of horror movies. This is a slap in the face for Landis and everyone else involved in American Werewolf in London. Blegh. I hope that this ruined the career of every one in it bar Julie Delphy. And CGI: Kind of new and chic back in 1997, but today it just looks drab compared to the artful prosthetic/makeup work of London. Anyway, I'm done, I hope I've scared a few people of. Get the original instead, or failing that The Howling. Or failing that watch American Idol reruns. Just don't watch this mess.\", \"Once upon a time there was a great American film. Which combined horror and comedy with equal thrills. This film featured clever direction. Groundbreaking special effects and superb comedic and serious acting. It was entitled 'An American Werewolf in London.' Sixteen years later the long awaited sequel was finally pinned onto the poster board outside your local theater. Surely it would have at least some of the thrills of the original. Think again. 'An American Werewolf in Paris' is an incomprehensible mess from start to pitiful finish. The problems begin with the leading man. Tom Everett Scott's performance is stiff and tiresome. From the outset he seems intent on proving that all young people are simpletons. In his defense, not even a seasoned Shakespearean thespian could have extracted a good performance from the juvenile and witless dialogue. At one point, one of Scott's deceased friends, who's soul is doomed to walk the Earth after being carved up by one of the werewolves, Is finally able to leave for the afterlife. He then quips to Scott and his friends. 'Okay guys, see ya.' What a memorable goodbye. Julie Delphy soon shows up as Scott's mysterious European love interest. Basically, she's a French girl playing the French girl. It isn't much of a stretch. But all this stupidity isn't even the most disappointing thing about the film. The special effects, such an integral part of the superb original film, fall far short in this flop. The werewolves look like cartoons. And no matter how well you sculpt a cartoon with sinewy lycanthrope muscles. It's still hard to get scared of a cartoon. So instead the vacationing American gang, led by the ultra weak Scott, keep finding excuses to return to the werewolf's catacombs lair. Here it's much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness. Some have said that if you don't look on this film as a sequel it's not as bad by comparison. I disagree, this film can not stand on its own, and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original. If it doesn't want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 film. I , don't care how much you love werewolves. Or how much you worshiped 'American Werewolf in London.' as I myself did. This one is simply not worth wasting your time. 'Okay guys, see ya.' Terrible. 3 out of a possible 10 T.H.\", \"Woeful and unnecessary sequel to a bonafide classic. An American Werewolf in London was, indisputably, a gem of a movie: humorous, demented, with just a dash of romance and so very, very British it made me want to stand up and sing God Save the Queen every time the movie ended. Then came this abomination. You know you are in real trouble when the leads are so utterly unlikeable you are glad when they are slaughtered, and actually start cheering for the lycanthropes. Tell you the truth, folks, I only got about half way through this CGIed travesty before losing the will to live and turning it off. Absolutely pitiful and a putrid waste of anyone's time.\", \"I can't honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of John Landis classic comedy horror movie from 1981 . I suppose you can't really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one set in London: An American tourist visits a famous European capital , he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague , he embarks ( Pardon the pun ) on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession , he turns into a werewolf , he's visited by apparitions of his dead victims , etc etc . and reading the previous line I've just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed . The difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the Landis movie is   With this Paris based movie there's no scenes that really stand out . There's no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how he's going to get back home with no money or clothes , there's no bizarre dream sequence of Naziwerewolves and there's no spectacular climax . AAWIP does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humour ? I'm thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone he's got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms ! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that there's no poignancy involved with this dubious follow up . You really do feel sorry for the protagonist's fate and dilemma in the London movie , here you just feel Andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script . There's also a large number of plot holes visible . Is this the first time The Lunar Club have carried out a massacre ? If not then aren't large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the world's press ? Why haven't the police got leads ?  Everyone else has mentioned it and so will I - The visuals are poor . Look at the bungee jumping scene at The Eifell Tower , it's painfully obvious that it's achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish CGI . I won't put Anthony Waller in the same bracket as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on CGI ( The major problem with AAWIP is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic ) but I would have preferred the Rick Baker type special effects used for the transformation . To be fair it's reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget didn't stretch that far . But at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didn't need to be made and DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment\"], \"review_score\": [7, 10, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 3, 3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4], \"review_category\": [\"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 3.966666666666667}, \"Anastasia\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0118617\", \"total_review_count\": 1, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"Animated children's movies should really stick to real fairy tales rather than manufacturing them out of grim novels and grimmer history.

It is unfortunate that the rather pathetic Woody Allen, an admittedly intelligent man who alas squanders his considerable talents, firmly believes that the cosmos revolves around his legendary neuroses. Even more unfortunate, is the fact that he has succeeded in persuading a large percentage of the Western world to agree with him. Frankly, it does not speak well of our culture.  This (yawn) movie revolves around a pair of self absorbed lovers...a neurotic New York comedian, Alvy Singer (played by Woody) and a would-be singer, Annie Hall. The two, both in analysis, move in together so they can exchange tales of their professional, paid for navel gazing. I certainly wouldn't want to imply that it might be simply for the convenient sex. The rest of this so called neurotic romance is far too inconsequential to bother detailing here.  Annie Hall is played by Diane Keaton, an actress who is actually very competent. Her movies are frequently not my favorite, though I did enjoy the cute Baby Boom. Her only memorable aspect in this film is her Ralph Lauren clothes, now of course quite dated, which supposedly caused a fashion revolution at the time.   That classic comment of Woody's regarding sex, \\\"This is the most fun I've had without laughing\\\" doesn't particularly impress me with its brilliance. Fear not, Shakespeare, Woody serves as no threat to you as master of the English language. It is indeed sad that so many people seem to praise this mindless, uninspiring, unoriginal, and not even particularly amusing pearl of wisdom as though it had virtually descended from the gods on Mount Olympus.  Annie Hall isn't the absolute worst movie I've ever seen, but it really doesn't have much to recommend it. I normally adore romances, but neither one of these two selfish neurotics captured my sympathy or even remote interest. Furthermore, the supposed witty banter between the pair failed woefully to either entertain or amuse me. Back in 1977 when I saw this movie at the theatre with my husband (then boyfriend), we both sincerely wished we'd found some paint and watched it dry instead. I guess this intellectual comedy was just far too complicated for little old us to appreciate.\"], \"review_score\": [0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Anniversary Party\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0254099\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Antz\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0120587\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Apartment\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0053604\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Apocalypse Now\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0078788\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 30, \"review_content\": [\"Breathtaking at it's best, intriguing at it's worst, Francis Ford Coppala's groundbreaking epic 'Apocalypse Now' is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century, and in my opinion, the greatest ever film depiction centered around America's involvement in Vietnam.  What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre. Growing up as movie buff, and with a particular interest in war films, I've seen many films, which have attempted to portray the 'images' and 'feelings' of Vietnam but have been unsuccessful in doing so. Films such as 'Hamburger Hill' and 'We were soldiers' fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of Vietnam by depicting 'heroic battles' which are, more often than not, tainted by the zeal of Hollywood film production.  In 'Apocalypse now' there are no battles, no heroes or villains, there is nothing in the film that suggests that it is intended to reflect the imagery of Vietnam through the physical aspects of war. Rather, it is a film, which powerfully investigates and explores the human psyche when it has been tormented by the absolute 'horror' of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous century.  The sheer brilliance of the acting (in particular the interpretation of taciturn Captain Willard by Martin Sheen), along with the spectacular cinematography (filmed in the Phillipines), which provides crucial realism to the backdrop of the film, makes 'Apocalypse Now' an unforgettable epic.  Evoking a myriad of emotions and leaving us with a maelstrom of mediation, 'Apocalypse now' is not for the light-hearted moviegoer. It is masterpiece that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated.\", \"This is a classic war movie. One of the best, a stark image fest of flashing lights, harrowing dark backgrounds and helicopter blades morphing into ceiling fans. A star-studded spectacle of immense power.  Martin Sheen is a mercenary sent up river to assassinate the general gone astray, a sadistic dictator played beyond belief by the great Marlon Brando. Also along for the ride are, Robert Duvall as an over the top DI with a penchant for \\\"napalm in the morning\\\" or at least the smell of it. Dennis Hopper is an edgy photojournalist with a view slanted views about the war and about his leader. Also in this amazing film you'll see up and coming stars such as Laurence Fishburne, R. Lee Ermey, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall and keep an eye out for Harrison Ford too...  Behind the lens is Francis Ford Coppolla delivering a film with maybe more intensity and drama than the acclaimed Godfather films, he highlights war in it's most basic form, which for the most part is something you can't see, you can only feel it, as the boat carries on up river the feeling of the war tightening in is quite unbearable. The feeling of this is a rather claustrophobic feeling and really makes for unusual moods from the viewers. Honestly no films has ever made me feel like that.  Criticism is hard to find. The biggest qualm from some is that Brando earned tons of money for a ten minute role, but in all fairness this is unjustified. It was money well earned, a role that physically restricted him, being at the time an unwell man, and a role that he really made his own. I can't picture anyone better for the role. And if you get the Apocalypse Now Redux version, there's some extra bits of the great man, and I think the Redux does make the film miles better.  Final impressions are that if you are lucky to get the Redux version then you will be blessed with a completely satisfying film with a cool 49 minutes extra footage. If not, then still you won't be disappointed, this film is up there with the best, and deserves some great recognition, and a firm place as one of the top 50 films ever made...\", \"This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world. The social criticism of our shallow, commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the \\\"war is hell\\\" clich\\u00e9, underscored by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a rogue colonel, who's left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece. In particular, I found the final segment of the journey with Brando, which encapsulates Conrad's Heart of Darkness, to be rather boring. I finally got around to seeing Apocalypse Now Redux and the flaws have been taken care of. Redux makes the movie an outright masterpiece, certainly among the top 100 films ever made. Brando's performance now seems full and complete, perhaps rather less mysterious, but much more profound. Martin Sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best acting ensembles ever assembled. It's great to spot a young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, etc. in early screen performances that suggest what fine actors they will eventually be recognized as. The work of Robert Duvall, Fred Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional footage. If you've never seen this film, skip the original and head straight for Redux. I wish we could get a Gangs of New York Redux from Scorcese to fill in all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece.\", \"I would like to submit the following goof.  During the bridge scene, soldiers are seen wading out in the river, asking to be taken away and seeking to escape. Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases. Soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone. They have duffel bags, packs and footlockers but not suitcases. The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping. Additionally, if you look closely, you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water. This is probably a very good indication that it is empty,otherwise it would sink.\", \"It carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of Vietnam and into the wild-eyed look of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mystical morbidity surrounding Colonel Kurtz.(I don't say Marlon Brando because after watching the documentary, \\\"Hearts of Darkness,\\\" I am skeptical as to how much credit Brando is due for that quality). The tone of voice I'm talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing: \\\"Everybody gets what he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one. They sent it up with room service.\\\" It is indulgent without being narrow and alienating. A good example of is Hopper's indulgence into aphoristic madness, generously installing lines written by T.S. Eliot and Rudyard Kipling into his stony monologues: \\\"I mean, the man's a genius\\u0097sometimes he'll walk right by you without even saying a word, and sometimes he'll grab you by the collar and say \\\"did you know that 'if' is the middle word in 'life'\\u0085if you can hold your head while all around you they are losing theirs\\\" and then \\\"I mean he's a wise man, he's a great man; I should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas\\\" (The first one's Kipling, the second one's Eliot.\", \"You can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard; that layer is hackneyed. Or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war (stripped of \\\"judgement\\\"); that layer is completely uninteresting.  Or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of Duvall's one-liners, but that's just a coating for commercial mastication.  You can try to view this as a 'realistic' Vietnam war film, but ask any veteran and he'll swat down that notion -- most vets will say it stinks.  Or view it as a 'will he or won't he' morality play -- nothing rich there, either.  Where I found the value was in the superb self-reference. Coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions (the war) to fit the greatness of the skilled multi-dimensional actor playing 'a great man'.  Brando the man was as much of a maverick as the Kurtz character. The studios were uncomfortable with his acting 'method', yet he always excelled and won accolades; the 'generals' are uncomfortable with Kurtz's 'unsound methods', in spite of his strategic genius.  So Coppola makes a movie all about Brando's greatness. To hammer on the point, he places himself in the movie (as Hopper, a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras) to spout his praises. Brando himself is only seen in half-light and silhouettes -- brilliant cinematography by Storaro that only increases the actor's power. And he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation. Oh, yes: \\\"the horror...\\\"   Other pieces of interest: the great use of point of view camera perspectives, including 'being in the firefight' long before \\\"Private Ryan\\\"; the ground breaking use of sound, notably the ominous flanging sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid trip.  Don't get caught in the outer layers; the rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound, vision and self-reference.\", \"I have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect. And it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie. I mean you just have to love Robert Duval , Marlon Brando , Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie but specially Duval. I can not believe that Kramer vs. Kramer did win an Oscar in stead of this amazing war movie. So this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie ( The Godfather ) and the best of Hollywood actors you can only succeed. Now I just have to writhe something to get this preview so do not read this except the last line. This movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\", \"Brilliant actors and brilliant picture!! I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning, it is just SO touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic! The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances. Modern war movies are spending so much money on effects. This is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate. How insane the world is and the power of will and friendship, love and passion. A must seen movie and without any doubts the best war movie ever! Many tried to copy but still there are no movie even close as good as this!!\", \"This movie is a must see for any war movie buff. One of the greatest movies of all time and loaded with great quotes such as:  Kilgore: If I say its safe to surf this beach Captain, then its safe to surf this beach!  Kilgore: Smell that? You smell that? Lance: What? Kilgore: Napalm, son. Nothing in the world smells like that. Kilgore: I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for 12 hours. When it was all over, I walked up. We didn't find one of 'em, not one stinkin' dink body. The smell, you know that gasoline smell, the whole hill. Smelled like... victory. Someday this war's gonna end...\", \"It's that film that loads of people hail as a classic - Apocalypse Now, now a re-cut, re-up, Redux 22 years after it's original release.  The film is loosely based on Conrad's Heart of Darkness, it's main plot (if it has one) being Capt. Willard's journey on a naval boat through the Vietnam conflict on his way to terminate a rogue Colonel. (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and situations he meets, and he tells the Colonel's story along the way.  My initial feelings towards the film is that it's not particularly gripping at times, especially early on, but at least a good dose of comedy is put in, in the form of surfing fanatic Col. Kilgore. As the film progresses however, a good deal of tension is built up with Willard's reading through various reports on Col. Kurtz until the end is in sight, when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and holds it there until the end.  The usual aspects everyone looks for in a decent film are all of a good standard. Cinematography in particular stands out as exceptional, and I found the performances of Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest to all be worthy of a special mention. The score I found initially sounded out of place, but as the film progressed... I'm not entirely sure if it did actually get better, or it fitted better, or if it had just grown on me, but by the end of the film I was thoroughly enjoying it.  This is the second time I have seen the Redux version, (I have seen the original around four times) I'll say now that the first time I saw it I was disappointed. I was expecting a \\\"classic\\\" film, with lots of war. The fact that Willard got the mission at the beginning of the film and didn't carry it out until the end had me bored because all of the character interaction on the way that IS the film seemed unnecessary. This is due to the fact that the plot is not entirely defined (as the focus is more on the character and the journey more than the plot), in most cases a second viewing is needed to appreciate the film fully (as with all films that are more character than plot based), as the second time around, you know where the plot is going. I had a similar experience with It's A Wonderful Life, which is now one of my favourite films.  With the big four Vietnam films, Apocalypse Now wins over the rest on atmosphere, but lacks the action and involvement of Platoon, the emotional intensity of The Deer Hunter, and cannot really be compared to Full Metal Jacket (probably my favourite of the four). Apocalypse Now is a great piece of work, especially towards the end where it becomes staggering, and is to be recommended for anyone who enjoys a good character based film and doesn't mind some casual violence.\", \"First of all, I believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Conrad's \\\"Heart Of Darkness\\\", the book that was the literary basis for the movie. With that said, I believe that this movie is astounding. It is an excellent war film that doesn't so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the Vietnam Conflict, but more the psychological toll that it took on the young, inexperienced \\\"kids\\\" who were sent to fight it. Coppola showed real genius in the art of film-making, using many visuals to help tell the story. The acting I felt was definitely all-around up to par. Marlon Brando's part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting. His elucidation to Willard at the end of the film reels you in, and reveals the hollowness of a man that you've heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie. Those who would consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed look to all the literary elements that are entwined with this film, because there is a great amount of meaning behind it all. In my opinion, this is one of the most sculptured and best-made films of all time.\", \"Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance, open-mindness, and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the United States has ever had. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the American political and cultural scenes, the racial struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture, the increase of violence and death in the streets...) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare, be different, and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures. Coppola's film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film-making, following the parameters of war and adventure films, and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life, the reason of death, or the ethics of war. It is also a passionate work, made against all odds, chronicled in the 1991 documentary \\\"Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse\\\"; a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam war ever to reach the screen. This may not be the definite Vietnam motion picture, but dealing with it Coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two Vietnam movies made simultaneously, \\\"The Deer Hunter\\\" and \\\"Coming Home\\\", or in latter ones as \\\"Platoon\\\" and \\\"Casualties of War\\\", before Vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre, as horror in \\\"Jacob's Ladder\\\", or comedies as \\\"Good Morning, Vietnam\\\", among the more respectable. Coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life, without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war.\", \"I decided I need to lengthen up my review for my all time favorite film. Unlike other war films that focus on the event, Apocalypse Now takes the viewer into a psychological head trip. The sheer surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, yet you can't lay your eyes off of it. Based off of Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, Apocalypse Now slowly descends its protagonist, Willard (Martin Sheen) into madness, most likely the same way Kurtz plunged into insanity. The production of this film is notorious for its delays provided by the monsoon season and for Brando's unprepared performance (he read his lines from cue cards). There is a documentary titled Apocalypse Now: A filmmakers Apocalypse which shows the hell everyone went through in making this.  The opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any film. As the blade of the helicopters are heard in slow motion and napalm is dropped in the trees, the song \\\"The End\\\" by the Doors can be heard. The next shot is of Willard in his bed with the fan on, so the noise of the helicopter coincides with the fan. We are informed that he does special missions for the military, mostly assassinations. When his next mission is given to him, he is baffled. \\\"Charging a man with murder here is like giving a speeding ticket in the Indy 500.\\\" The man he has to kill was a respected colonel that has gone insane and isolated himself along with tribes people. Kurtz is ordering atrocious acts that are carried out by these people and he must me stopped. Willard does not go alone however. He is carried on a boat with several soldiers and they come across several battles. Along the way, they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore \\\"Hoorah\\\" about the war. Willard ponders that if Kilgore is that crazy, what could Kurtz be like. There are many scenes that portray Willards plunge into insanity: The tiger attack, the slaughter of innocent Vietnamese, the nonstop rain, the piled dead bodies scattered about, and the deaths of his crew members. When he reaches the Kurtz compound, he is greeted by the village people and a hippie photojournalist (Dennis Hopper). Instead of assassinating Kurtz right away, Willard begins talking with him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do. Kurtz, on the other hand wants to die. He is tired of the war and wants to go down as a soldier. Willard kills him with a machete while in unison, a buffalo is sacrificed with several machetes by the people. Once they realize their leader has been slain, instead of killing Willard, they hail him as their new king. Willard rejects the offer and leaves them.  The cinematography here is absolutely breathtaking. The colors are grain free, something that is rare in older movies. I can watch it muted and admire the beauty of the scenery.  The acting ensemble is terrific, with everyone playing their parts well. Many criticize Brando for some reason, but I think he nails his role as a depressed lunatic who is beaten up by the war.  The soundtrack and the score are haunting, and provide the mood for the film. I am wondering what instrument they used in that guitar-like sound when the credits roll? There have been many parodies of this film, but my favorite quote comes from Marge Simpson when she explains to Homer why a character with the same name on a police show is behaving like an idiot: \\\"Your character provides comic relief for the show, like um, Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now.\\\" Those who have seen the movie know why this is hilarious.\", \"I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981, as he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert. He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art, especially his portrayal of the young Captain. This is, without a doubt, a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History. \\\"Charlie Don't Surf\\\". Robert Duvall's famous line (the other one) does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his Pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic American war hawk in the John Wayne tradition. It is a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks.\", \"Even with all the cinema dealing with the trauma of the Vietnam War (Jacob's Ladder, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, and Taxi Driver to an extent) one feels that we don't even know the half of what happened. Even contemplating the horror feels inhuman. And a progression - or retreat? - to the inhumanity that it necessitates is a key part of Apocalypse Now, Coppola's greatest and one of the most important films ever made. Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's 1902 classic, \\\"Heart of Darkness\\\" which chronicles the loss of sanity and corruption of morality that comes with distance from civilization - a surfacing of a bestial nature, as it were, a la Lord of the Flies - it brings the story of a physical and psychological journey to Vietnam. The story is of Willard, a general commissioned on a special mission to Cambodia after his first tour of duty in Vietnam is served. Willard at the beginning of the film is stuck in Saigon, psychologically unable to go back home - eerily echoing Nicky in The Deer Hunter. So he is contacted: his mission is to assassinate a renegade Green Beret who has isolated himself in a remote outpost on the Nung River, and who has purportedly gone completely insane - worshiped like a god by the natives, and killing indiscriminately. This man's name is Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando in the second best role of his career (the best being Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire). As Willard journeys upriver in an army boat with some soldiers accompanying, his witnessing the horrors and the insanity - and the overwhelming pointlessness of it all - leads to an eerie sympathy and identification with Kurtz before they even meet. By the time they do, Kurtz's methods don't really seem as wrong or as they should, and they certainly don't seem too unusual or out-of-place. Apocalypse - a place beyond morality, the outpost on the end of the world. The loss of civilization, the loss of judgement, of self. Kurtz's monologue about an atrocity he witnessed as a Green Beret, and his later revelation, is one of the most chilling and well-delivered speeches in cinema history. The film is about trauma, about the human spirit and its breaking point - here, it's a lot like The Deer Hunter, and just as good. Apocalypse, however, takes the boundaries of what we can endure to a global level - Coppola's sweeping footage of the humid, murky jungles of Cambodia and an opening sequence of helicopters amid exploding forests and an orange sky - set to an oddly fitting Doors soundtrack - as well as chilling scenes on the river and of an air raid on a village with Wagner blasting from speakers (a scene which has gone down as one of the most chilling, darkly humorous, and strikingly pointless war scenes ever) - this all contributes to the sense of Apocalypse - the end of the world - and not at some distant point in the future, but Apocalypse Now and forever. The Deer Hunter is much more up close and personal, you can even tell by the title, and shows the totalling effect trauma has on the individual psyche, the breaking down of the human soul, and its ability to either surrender completely to forces of darkness, or to limp on. This is why both films are equal - they are two parts of the same thing. In \\\"Heart of Darkness\\\", Kurtz is shown as conflicted between morality (civilization) and his inner savage. In Apocalypse Now, Kurtz has left all conflict behind. He is beyond good and evil. He has let go of morality like a drowning man lets go of a saving hand in the moments before his death. Kurtz indeed is only waiting for death, quoting T. S. Eliot in his temple to himself, lost in the jungle. His last words, and the words echoed at the end of the movie, are, \\\"The horror...the horror.\\\" He is referring to the infinite void of existence, of the human psyche, and to the pitch black emptiness within his own mind, where atrocities are born again. It is impossible to express in words the experience one goes through watching this film - the experience, in short, that Willard experiences on his journey. The end part, at the outpost, almost in fact comparable to its brother scene in The Deer Hunter, is one of the most deeply, calmly, and seductively disturbing things I've ever seen.\", \"Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs, and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like \\\"The Longest Day\\\" and \\\"The Green Berets\\\" which seem more like Disney fantasies by comparison. The \\\"Apocalypse Now!\\\" project, the production and resulting film, is \\\"Heart of Darkness\\\" updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post-modernist variety. The cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve. This is the plight of Joseph Conrad's original character Kurtz who came into literary being in 1901 and subsequently referenced in TS Eliot's \\\"The Hollow Men\\\" (Mistah Kurtz, he dead) of 1925. Although neither a straight telling of Conrad's \\\"Heart of Darkness\\\" (1901) nor a first-hand account of the Vietnam experience, \\\"Apocalypse Now!\\\" stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the envelope of cinematic potential. \\\"Apocalypse\\\" is not just about the \\\"horrors\\\" of war per se, like \\\"Platoon\\\" and \\\"The Deer Hunter\\\", but the darker sensibilities of human nature as revealed through the raw and demeaning confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale. Apocalypse Now! is not so much seen as experienced.  The bulk of the movie is the journey of a trained secret assassin, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in a tour-de-force performance), aboard a US military boat traversing an unnamed river into the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia where few westerners would ever tread. His mission is to terminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a career army Special Forces Division officer who was the darling of the US Military until he went AWOL and renegade in the deep uncharted jungles between Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The official classified report is that the colonel has gone insane but as events play out, something else has happened to him that is far more terrifying than simply insanity. Sheen's mission is to terminate the colonel with the American public none the wiser.  The movie is rather episodic. The journey along the river is made up of several vignettes as Sheen and his crew meet different self-contained \\\"aspects\\\" of the war at the ground level. American audiences of the 1970's had probably never seen this kind of film-making before, with the possible exception of \\\"The Deer Hunter\\\" which was released in the previous year. The first, and one of the most notable, is an helicopter battalion led by Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is a cross between General Robert E Lee and Richard Wagner. He loves to play \\\"Ride of the Valkyries\\\" from Wagner's \\\"The Ring\\\" when he bombards helpless villages. His line \\\"I love the smell of Napalm in the morning\\\" is one of those oft-quoted lines from the annals of cinema. Other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted privates will be entertained by the likes of Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunnies.  Despite all the production catastrophes that impeded getting this footage into the can, the remarkable aspect of this film is its pacing. The original release (not the later Redux version) does a fine of job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between Willard and Kurtz. The strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission alone. And some of the shots of both Sheen and Brando in certain places are some of the starkest and terrifying images ever produced on film. Not even the likes of Clive Barker, Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything on Coppola in terms of horrific imagery. Brando's Kurtz in one scene in particular is so utterly terrifying it makes most other horror movies seem tame by comparison, which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from without but from within.  Without giving too much away, Coppola's solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations. According to the documentary \\\"Hearts of Darkness\\\", Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would lapse into melodrama, and the atmosphere of the movie's darker hues would be compromised. He wasn't sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox as practiced by the native people with whom Coppola was using as extras in the scenes with Kurtz at \\\"his\\\" village. After the viewing, Coppola had his ending, and it is one of the most simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of American film-making. Love it or hate it, no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scene.  This film is not for all tastes just as Conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes. It's not just the violence and the pointlessness of violence that are difficult for most American viewers to absorb. It's the naked unveiling of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban American life that make this film difficult for the average movie-goer to handle, which is as it should be. Coppola did not make a family picture. However, if the viewer can understand its larger point, there is a lot to be gotten out of Apocalypse Now!. If you're looking for a film experience to reaffirm pre-existing attitudes about American sensibility and heroism, better stick with John Wayne. But if you're willing to be taken into places you've never been, even beyond \\\"the evils of war\\\" rhetoric, \\\"Apocalypse Now\\\" will take you into a world you thought you'd never visited before, and the disturbing part of it is that you may recognize it.\", \"Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) has been sent on a classified mission into Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces, it is hard for Capt. Willard to understand how Col. Kurtz could go off the deep end as he has, killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands. What possibly could have pushed this great man over the top? Through Willard's long journey through the jungle to find his target, he tries with some success to understand why. But what will he decide to do once he finds him?  Any movie that can start out with The Doors' \\\"The End\\\" is a great movie in my book, especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song. Apocalypse Now does this perfectly. I can't think of anything better for it to be set to, the Vietnam War and the insanity in the soliders' minds that it created. AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in Vietnam, the ultimate destination of which is murder. Through it's use of music and score alone, we are thrown into a dark world of mystery, violence, and insanity. A perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here.   An overall great cast, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread. I just don't like Fishburne, ever since I found out he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold. I realize the pettiness of this but I simply do not care. We need to sick Gary Oldman on him. Brando is excellent as Col. Kurtz and I can't think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence. Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general. My favorite character in the movie has to be Robert Duvall's Lt. Colonel Kilgore. Before this film I never pictured Duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it's my favorite of his parts to date. He simply nailed his character, which is one of the best in the entire film, as the gung-ho Air Cavalry commander who loves to surf. Maybe a little over the top but still brilliant. I also love the smell of napalm in the morning.  The plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn't take too much brainpower to figure out what's going on. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz, plain and simple. But it's the journey of the film that is really it's heart and also the dire situations of war itself. In the Redux version we are forced to sit through the extended French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film's entirety other than it makes it a longer journey. I don't feel they take away anything though, it's just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original. Through this journey, the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the Americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it...in fact, that's the entire point. On top of that, the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like Kurtz' to go completely mad.   A big war movie lover, this one is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter, all of them classics. I sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as I have had to go back on what I've said. All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War....so to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointless...even if after having most recently view AN I think it's a tad better. In the end, Apocalypse Now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it's been given. As a fellow reviewer has previously stated, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made.\", \"Spoilers. This review has been edited due to word limit.  `The horror. The horror.' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)  The sentence which is as famous as `Here's looking at you, kid,' or `Are you talkin' to me?' or `May the Force be with you,' or `I'll be back,' means a little more than some one-liners. When it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed. What might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re-watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single frame.  What, exactly, does this line of dialogue mean? The horror spoken of is the reality of war. The reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt. When Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) stands before the dying Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the film, `The horror.the horror.' is the realization of Willard's corruptness. He has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment. This isn't a typical Hollywood ending. In most cases a character gains something, whether it be emotionally, physically, mentally or all three. But Willard both gains and loses. He gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals. And that is a shocking ending.  `Apocalypse Now' is Francis Ford Coppola's tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking. This film is wholly different from `The Godfather.' It is hallucinogenic, visually dazzling, and an ode to the guilty side of human nature. At first it seems realistic, and then it becomes strange, and then symbolic, and, by the end, original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare. This is not as much a film about the Vietnam War as it is a film about the war within us.  At first it does appear to be another war film. Captain Willard (Sheen) is assigned by an Army Lieutenant (a young Harrison Ford) to assassinate a renegade American Colonel named Kurtz (Brando), who is hiding out somewhere in Vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as his slaves.  Willard carries out his mission `with extreme prejudice,' heading out on a boat along with four soldiers, including the boat captain, Chief (Albert Hall), Chef (Frederic Forest), and a very young `Larry' Fishburne (who later went on to appear as Morpheus in `The Matrix').  \\\"Apocalypse Now\\\" is in a many ways a modern update of Homer's Odyssey. As our main character, Willard, carries on his journey, he meets an array of original and strange characters, including Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who has a strange fetish for surfing, and a stoned photographer (Dennis Hopper), whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser Jeremy Davies in \\\"The Million Dollar Hotel,\\\" one of the worst films I have ever seen. Davies failed to make any connection with an audience; Hopper does. He is like the poetic vibe between Willard and Kurtz; he is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages. In this case, he is translating Kurtz to Willard, although I'm not so sure Kurtz needs a translation of Willard.  Many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines. \\\"Apocalypse Now\\\" has many. Kilgore descending upon a Vietnam village playing Wagner's \\\"Ride of the Valkyries\\\" remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history. There is sharpness to it, a brutality to it, an ironic tone to it, and also a sense of playfulness. When Kilgore kneels down on that beach and says, `I love the smell of napalm in the morning.it smells like victory,' we all crack a smile.  I won't lie to you: `Apocalypse Now' is a strange film. It isn't exactly the easiest thing to analyze. The end may frustrate some viewers if they don't understand Marlon Brando's significant speeches. But what it all comes down to, what really matters, is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche. The horror is the realization of war and its effects, not the war itself. Kurtz says, `You have a right to kill me. But you have no right to judge me.' Brando's character, Kurtz, is left to the audience to judge. To many na\\u00efve viewers he may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to his head. But that isn't what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to get across. By fighting in Vietnam, Kurtz has realized just how great he had it, and how bad some others had it. By walking through devastated villages he eventually comes to realize that we are the na\\u00efve ones, living our lives in a fool's paradise. We are totally na\\u00efve to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit. By seeing how unlucky some Vietnamese are, Kurtz realizes just how easily he could be struck by something. Just how easily he could end up like the people around him. And he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door. Many people think the horror is one thing. It is two. For Kurtz, the horror is the reality of how na\\u00efve he was and the reality of the war's impact upon men. And after Willard murders Kurtz, and hears Kurtz's dying words, he realizes it too. He realizes the effects of war. To see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man. And what it has done to him. The horror.  5/5 stars -  \", \"Well, I've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It is definitely one of the most unique films ever made.  I still think Martin Sheen got \\\"dissed\\\" big-time in the billing, too. He dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours, 17 minutes film (theatrical version). How unfair is that?  Sheen is fantastic in here, especially his narration, which runs throughout. It's one of the best narrations, if not THE best, I have ever heard in a movie. His voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible, nightmare-like adventure. I never fail to appreciate his work in this movie.  The other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes, ones I have never forgotten, such as......  Sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movie's first scene; Robert Duvall and the totally out-of-place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with Wagner's dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters; The Playboy bunny entertaining the troops; Frederic Forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle; the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride; the appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper greeting the crew in Cambodia and then Brando's bizarre character. It goes on and on with strange scenes.  That's not to say I enjoyed everything. No, there are a few very unpleasant scenes, such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half (can't watch that anymore), an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by Sheen's young stoned-out crew, and the crew is a little too goofy at times. Then, there is the huge amount of profanity, led by way too many f-words.  So, there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this One thing for sure: it is a film you WILL remember!\", \"From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out. It has this freakish feel to it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. It is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies. What does push to such a high level is the:   The directing was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie. Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war. Most others just display and show you the horrors of war. Coppola though makes you feel confused, shocked and scared. These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story. This is something that I have only experienced very few times while watching a film. The writing was of course amazing too. It brought you write into the middle of the movie. It never made me bored and this movie is three hours. The cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the freakish experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calm.  The acting was bone-chilling. Just look at Marlon Brando also giving his last great performance playing a deluded, out of whack colonel. When ever I think of a crazy gone made soldier I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now. With Brando n this film you don't want to look into his eyes. Like the movie he was freakish. To me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather. Martin Sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of his career making you see everything through his eyes all the craziness he is experiencing and yet wanting him to get to his goal. It is just a wonder why these two did not get Oscar nominations. Robert Duvall was able to show part of that craziness with his ludicrous battle strategies, among those playing music to tell the enemy he is coming. Also Duvall's character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable. Other great supporting performances were given by a young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a clich\\u00e9. Also for once cameos were put into good use having Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford who I both love.  I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie. It has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best. There is nothing more I could ask of this movie with its great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and great ending. Watch and you will see why it lives up to its title Apocalpyse Now.\", \"After the success of the first two 'Godfather' films in 1972 and 1974 respectively, Francis Ford Coppola embarked on an ambitious attempt to bring home the reality of the war in Vietnam, which had concluded with the fall of Saigon to the Vietcong in 1975\\u0085 The plot was loosely based on the book 'Heart of Darkness,' a story by Joseph Conrad about Kurtz, a trading company agent in the African jungle who has acquired mysterious powers over the natives\\u0085Coppola retains much of this, including such details as the severed heads outside Kurtz's headquarters and his final words, \\\"The horror\\u0085 the horror\\u0085\\\"   In the film, Sheen plays an army captain given the mission to penetrate into Cambodia, and eliminate, with \\\"extreme prejudice,\\\" a decorated officer who has become an embarrassment to the authorities\\u0085 On his journey up the river to the renegade's camp he experiences the demoralization of the US forces, high on dope or drunk with power\\u0085   Although, as a result of cuts forced on Coppola, the film was accused of incoherence when first released, it was by the most serious attempt to get to grips with the experience of Vietnam and a victorious reinvention of the war film genre\\u0085 In 1980 the film won an Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Sound\\u0085   \\\"Apocalypse Now\\\" was re-released in 2001 with fifty minutes restored\\u0085 As a result, the motion picture can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it is\\u0085\", \"This movie changed the art of film making, telling a complex story in a powerful new way. The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy, intercutting a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolour smoke. The film uses music not as a score laid in later, but as a practical part of the scene playing from speakers, radios etc. Coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration, taking scenes and characters, and putting them into entirely different surroundings. That is a tricky and brave thing to do. Then he takes a superstar, Brando, pays him a fortune, and films him so that you can barely see his face. The pure guts that such a move requires is astounding, and it works beautifully. This movie belongs in the top ten.\", \"Somewhere on IMDb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all times (Spielberg, Copolla and others are named there). The greatest argument was around Spielberg and whether he is or isn't a great director. The problem with Spielberg is that while he is a master technician, most of his films lack depth.Saving Ryan is really outstanding from a technical point of view, but its message is dull and while its very entertaining, it doesn't make you think about anything. AN is the best movie I ever saw because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things, starting from war in general, the clash of civilizations, the condition of soldier in wartimes (is a soldier a hero or an assassin? Brando says he is neither, the french lady says he is both ...) and many others. The problem with some people is that they try to argue about whether these points are true or false. But a great movie, and a great piece of art in general is supposed to spark arguments, not to solve them ... Maybe Coppola is right, or maybe he isn't, nobody holds the truth anyway. You can watch this movie for its outer beauty, amazing scenes, great acting and memorable quotes and you will be entirely satisfied. But what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality. You can't help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentary.Both Copolla and Moore tackle similar issues, but while Copolla presents matters from an outside , objective point of view, Moore takes a very partisan position that really compromises the whole point of a documentary ... It is really a shame that a film like Fahrenheit 9/11 won a prestigious award like Cannes. But anyway, if you want to start to understand a little of the Vietnam war, the Iraq war, the second World War and any war in general, you should definitely see this movie, and not the other one ...\", \"Francis Ford Coppola's \\\"Apocalypse Now\\\" is not a Vietnam War film. Do not confuse it with one. It is set to the back drop of the war, but it is a metaphorical exposition on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche. It is also one of the most audacious films ever made, produced, or even conceived (second to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. To call it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the film's production levels.  Opening with no credits and following a memorable first scene playing to the tune of the Doors \\\"The End\\\" as Martin Sheen's Captain Benjamin L. Willard hallucinates to images of helicopters and napalm, the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes. Willard's mission is to \\\"terminate... with extreme prejudice\\\" Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has invariably gone AWOL in the far reaches of the Cambodian jungle and, as told by his general, is \\\"out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops.\\\" Kurtz is a delusional Colonel now being worshipped by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god. For Willard, this covert operation seems somewhat more manageable than actual combat, yet, the journey he is about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behavior.  Teaming up with a small crew, they embark down the vast reaches of the river in a rickety boat. Along the way, Willard educates himself on all things Kurtz. During Sheen's raspy voice over, he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret. He was a normal man with a family, until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and he led himself down the path that Willard is being led. The descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not to far away. Eventually the power of the experience weights on the group as drugs and a sort of solitary confinement attacks their senses. But Willard seems unfazed and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. As he reads about this mythic figure, he is drawn to the man's power and why he has become what he has become. We know that Willard's slow decay will parallel that of Kurtz's.  Marlon Brando has been revered for decades. His presence: unmatchable. His genius: undeniable. But for those unacquainted with his acting prowess and unaccustomed to his physical nuance, Brando can be perceived, in the eyes of an uncompromising film-goer, as a hack. He is most certainly not. Brando was difficult to work with, hard to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for unintelligible rants and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable. The man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didn't. His Colonel Kurtz is a being of limitless delusions and continual profundity.  If the film is any indication of the journeys into hell than Francis Ford Coppola's actual experience with making this masterpiece is a true life account of one man's fanatical struggle to produce a movie. It is reported that during the film's 200 plus day principle photography schedule, Coppola contemplated suicide. The film was not only an undeniable struggle to make; it is a grueling film to watch. Coppola's sweat and blood seep through the pores of the steamy locals and his dedication filters through the orifices of Martin Sheen's haunted soldier Willard.  I can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film. At the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented, films that challenged as well as stimulated were commonplace. Audacity aside, Apocalypse Now is pure film-making. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola is of the highest order. But I shudder at the return to what has become the norm for today's standards for film: a lack of innovation. It is not simply the unoriginality of the world of cinema today; it is the fact that nobody seems to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart. But we still have the great ones like Coppola's masterpiece, a film which bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than that which we could comprehend.  That depth in Apocalypse Now is the step into madness. The killing can disturb. The loss of innocence can unhinge. But it is the damage from within; the countless barrages of images that distress, unnerve and detach us from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually segregates us from humanity and propels us into the realm of the instinctual, the savage and the animalistic. If the thought of killing does not provide sustenance, the act of killing provides man with its fundamental catharsis.\", \"i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie. i've never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels. they just don't make movies like this anymore.  after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film (Hearts of Darkness:a filmmakers journey into madness), i'm even more amazed that this film even got finished, yet alone turn out so great.  the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the Phillipines is the film's greatest asset. you actually FEEL like your in Vietnam.  all of the actors are fantastic with my favorites still being Robert Duvall (\\\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning!!\\\") martin sheen, and the great Marlon Brando.  a lot of people complain that the film gets too murky, weird and cerebral near the end. well, remeber what Coppolla said about this movie, \\\"This film is not about vietnam, it IS vietnam!\\\" what he means is that this film is about MADNESS and not the war.  this movie is based on the short story \\\"Heart of darkness\\\" by Joseph Conrad and is set against the vietnam war instead of the civil war as in the book. i think that was a brilliant combination in my opinion.  this is perfect, challenging film that is dark, violent, humorous at times and well done in every single possible way.  a true classic  rating:10\", \"'Apocalypse Now Redux', Francis Ford Coppola's war opus is probably the most beautiful war film I have ever seen. Capt. Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnam soldier who is tapped to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission into Cambodia to 'terminate the position' of Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a highly ranked and highly regarded army man who seemingly has gone completely insane and defected from the army, setting up his own little society and helped by a cultish following of soldiers. Escorting him up the river to Cambodia is a handful of navy men, and along the way, they encounter several interesting people (most notably is Robert Duvall's Kilgore, a badass lieutenant colonel with a few screws loose) and some horrifying situations.   'Apocalypse' is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study. It is more 'Full Metal Jacket' than 'Platoon'. The running time of 'Apocalypse' is over three hours, but the film is so wonderfully paced and compelling that when the end of the film arrived, I was actually surprised at the amount of time that had passed. The beautiful cinematography is surely what stood out the most for me, however. After seeing this film, I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history. The 'Godfather' films were all tinged with an almost sepia tone, and shadows created the feeling of a Baroque composition. With 'Apocalypse', there is an incredible usage of natural light, and the shadows, particularly in the scenes involving Brando and Sheen, almost become a living character, they are so pervasive and effective. Another gorgeous scene was when Cpt. Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the jungle looking for mangoes, and come across a tiger. The sheer enormity of the surrounding foliage (leaves as big as a house) made the characters almost Lilliputian, but the colorization of the scene was incredible. While everything else was almost a muted grey, the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green, an effect that was particularly striking. Another really minor positive moment in the film was the great scene when the helicopters carrying Duvall and company attack the small village while playing Wagner. This could have just been an ultra-dramatic underlying soundtrack to the scene, but instead Coppola turns the song into an actual part of the scene, with Duvall mentioning that he likes to play it while they are approaching to 'scare the hell out of them'.   The performances in 'Apocalypse' are first class. Much has been made of the amount of money Brando earned for the film, and the amount of trouble he caused. Regardless of this, he turned out a powerful performance for a relatively short amount of screen time. Sheen is completely outstanding - this is the first time I have seen him really unleash in a film \\u0096 and Duvall is a lot of fun to watch as the loony Kilgore. 'Apocalypse Now' is a film that is so pervasive in pop culture by now (most know several choice lines from the film, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' et al) but I knew little enough about it that there were plenty of surprises left to experience. I have not seen the original cut of 'Apocalypse Now' so I cannot compare it to this newer cut, but this is a film that should most certainly be experienced. 8/10  --Shelly\", \"During the final throes of the Vitnam war, our central character, Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) is dispatched by the CIA on an illegal one-man mission to assassinate a renegade US Marine commander, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has allegedly gone 'completely insane', but who is successfully waging a private cross-border war from his base in Cambodia, a neutral and therefore off-limits country.  The entire narrated story of what Willard sees and does as he is ferried up the Da Nang river by an undisciplined and terrorised navy patrol boat crew to murder Kurtz is a grand metaphor for the excesses, decadence and ultimately the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: If we don't understand something, and we are unable to control it, exterminate it. Kurtz had eventually come to know this.  Unless you pay complete attention to every emotional gesture, to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists, especially in the scene where the two of them are alone in Kurtz's darkened lair, you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie. Kurtz's subtle deal with his executioner, his unilateral 'surrender' in return for Willard agreeing (did he nod?) to tell Kurtz's 'son' (another metaphor for us, the next generation, the ones watching the movie) the truth about all the horrors that they had both seen in Vietnam, is mind-expanding stuff.The bonding between the two men whilst Kurtz cross-examines Willard,--interlaced with some of his own horror stories, is incredible, nay, genius, film. The closing (intercut)scene of the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial bull is the single most powerful of symbols. Coppolla has made, intentionally or not, the ultimate anti-war statement, one that should resonate through the ages.\", \"As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film, I find it very interesting how few ,\\\"middle of the road\\\" comments there are. Everyone either loves it, or they hate it. Having seen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times, and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines?????), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film. \\\"Why would you like a film that's so confusing?\\\" ask many of my associates. The answer is this: Forget the war, forget the brutality....This is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo. Brando represents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done. They (Big Brother) sent him out to do the job, he does it too well, without adhering to the accepted \\\"standards\\\" of death and destruction (Am I the only one who's troubled by the fact that we have 'standards' for death and destruction????), so they send the \\\"Conformity Police\\\" out to eliminate the individual. Hmmmmmm....Draw any parallels between this and things you see every day? With the deepest respect to Mr. Coppola, whom I believe is one of the best directors of all time, I think he transcended his original intent of the movie, and probably didn't even realize it until after the movie was released. The subtle sub-text that permeates the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed; instead, it seems to have 'grown' itself, like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. Again I must reiterate: I think FF Coppola did a bang-up job on this entire production, as did the cast and crew, but the sum of the movie exceeds the individual efforts ten-fold. So if you haven't seen the movie, rent it, watch it, then watch it again, and maybe a few more times, and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life. Only then make a judgment on the quality of the film. Those of you that have seen it, watch it again with the mindset previously described. I think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film. Or maybe not! No matter whether you love it or hate it, be sure and give credit to Coppola for his masterful story-telling style!\", \"I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time . I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw it   This leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie . I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound , editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised ( Rightly too ) these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted , and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the border   How about the script ? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director but he's everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director , I said \\\" was \\\" in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head , but his sacrifice was worth it . In John Milius original solo draft we have a script that's just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen , but Coppola's involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war . Check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who wouldn't have looked out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes , so much so that by the time reaches Kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension . When Coppola states \\\" This movie isn't about Vietnam - It is Vietnam \\\" he's right . What started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the film's setting ( The Manson trial suggests it's 1970 ) had changed America's view of both the world and itself and of the world's view of America   It's the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians ( What did you do in the Vietnam War Mr President ? ) than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime . I've not seen the REDUX version but watching the original print I didn't feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic . In fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel who's leading an injun war party , or a sci-fi movie where a UN assassin is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier who's leading a resistance movement on Mars , though this is probably down to Joseph Conrad's original source novel  My all time favourite movie and it's very fitting that I chose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the IMDb\", \"My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN'T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious.   This movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie which it isn't at all, really it is more of a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is 'Platoon' in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers.   Coppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic.  It is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well. I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless. This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.  A little footnote, definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, watch the original version first, the 'Redux' version is, I think, more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a 'new and improved' version of the movie\"], \"review_score\": [9, 9, 10, 10, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10], \"review_category\": [\"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 9.533333333333333}, \"Arctic Blue\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0106303\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"As Good as It Gets\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0119822\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"No hot models. No action heros. No 'sappy' unrealistic love story. No intricate plot with twists and turns. Just arguably the best movie of 1997.  How? Great acting and a great story. Sounds too simple?  Basically, they took some odd, flawed characters that have little to do with each other, and make a great movie by bringing them together through some very unique circumstances and poking fun at all of them, but bringing you closer to them as you go. Character development is a large part of the movie.  I laughed at several scenes and felt moved in others. The funny scenes weren't corny and the heart-warming scenes weren't sappy. This movie is different than the normal movie, which is a big plus. The cast and their acting makes it all work. Probably the best all-around movie of 1997 in my opinion.\", \"This is the movie I\\u00b4ll never get tired of watching. I think it\\u00b4s perfect! Incredible dialogues to match incredible characters/actors. The cast is just perfect! There\\u00b4s no possible remake of this movie!

Like I said it\\u00b4s perfect!\", \"This is definetly one of my favorites ever! How anyone could say the characters were poorly developed is beyond me! The entire base of this movie was developing its characters! Without that there would have been nothing to watch at all. It was well written and funny too. I loved it, personally.\", \"The title is probably the most spot on title you'll hear. This movie is as good as it gets. This movie has flawless performances by Nicholson, Hunt, Kinnear, Knight, and Gooding Jr. The movie has a script that is so good it rivals scripts like American Beauty. As Good As It Gets is my second favorite movie of all time, just behind Jerry Maguire. That doesn't mean that it's the second BEST I've seen, but it certainly was the best film of the year, especially in a tough year. The Oscars were right on giving Nicholson and Hunt awards, I wish Kinnear had won. All in all this is a solid 10/10 film with it's charming humor and the times where you just want to hug yourself with delight. I recommend this to all film lovers.\", \"A wonderful tale of an obsessive, compulsive writer, who's life is forever changed by three things, a waitress, a gay artist, and a little dog.  Absolutely fantastic! \\\"As Good As It Gets\\\" is one of the finest films I've ever seen. From the excellent acting, to the superb directing, \\\"AGAIG\\\" is a truly unforgettable film. One of those rare films that only come out once in a blue moon.   The acting is nothing short of amazing! Jack Nicholson who plays Melvin, deserved the Oscar for his role. As did Helen Hunt as Carol the Waitress. And the directing is wonderfully done by James L. Brooks, (Fans of The Simpsons, may recognize that name, as he's the Executive Producer.) Not to mention the fabulous writing also done by Brooks!  \\\"As Good As It Gets\\\" is a must see! It's a shame that it was only nominated for Best Picture in 1997, it lost out to some movie about a sinking ship, directed by the guy who made \\\"Terminator 2\\\".  The title says it all in this rare and wonderful film; As Good As It Gets!  ***** Out of Five Stars (Outstanding!)\", \"As Good As It Gets is definitely one of the best movies I've seen. This movie depends entirely on it's script and the performance of it's actors, and both were excellent.   If there are people out there who doubt Jack Nicholson acting capabilities, I'd advise them to see this film. The way in which he portrays his character, a lonely and on the surface mean man suffering from OCD is just brilliant. The character was so real, and I really grew to like him during the movie.   And then there's Helen Hunt, I don't care what other people say, she is a great actress and people who say she's not feminine are just plain crazy. I do not think she's the beautiful, but when you watch this movie, how can you not fall in love with her character? To me that is the proof she's is a great actress.  And then there is Greg Kinnear, who also does a great job. This movie is just full of great performances.  The story is funny, dramatic and romantic, it's got it all. The characters are so well written that they feel real, and I like them so much, that I wish they were. The dialogues are great and there is a lot I will not soon forget.   ***** Spoiler (start)***** Melvin Udall: Where do they teach you to talk like this? In some Panama City \\\"Sailor wanna hump-hump\\\" bar, or is it getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey? Sell crazy someplace else. We're all stocked up here.  There are so many great scenes; Melvin and his interaction with the dog, and when he realizes he has stepped over the line by talking about carol's son. I also like his relationship with Simon, you can see him wrestling with the fact that he actually likes him. ***** Spoiler (finish)*****  I'd advise this movie to every serious movie fan. For in my opinion; This movie is As Good As Movies Get  \", \"TITANIC might have had the last laugh making the most money in 1997, but AS GOOD AS IT GETS bowed out with far more Oscars and respect. There are very little faults in this movie. With some crafty editing, flawless acting (even from a dog), and clever direction, AS GOOD AS IT GETS may probably end up being one of the greatest forgotten movies of the nineties.  We are introduced to Melvin Udall, a romance novelist with an obsessive compulsive behavior and a rotten attitude. When his next door neighbor, Simon, gets robbed and beaten brutally, his friend Frank assigns Melvin to take care of his dog while he recovers.  There is far much more to this movie than the causative incident. Helen Hunt 's role as Carol is just as equally well played as Greg Kinnear and Jack Nicholson 's. The acting is positively great. The screen writing is also just as superior. Some of the lines have had absolute positive effect on some of my friends throughout some troubled times (\\\"what if this is as good as it gets?\\\"). AS GOOD AS IT GETS relates to everybody, especially anyone who has a little Melvin in them. It is something that everyone can smile and laugh at.\", \"The problem with plot driven movies is that they are confined to the plot. Any and all plot driven movies (movies that rely on plot instead of character to tell the story) must stay within that plot. Jurassic Park must always involve dinosaurs. Bringing Out the Dead must involve ambulance drivers. Die-Hard must involve terrorists. This is not a bad thing. All of those movies I mentioned above are great movies, but they are plot driven.   It is nice, however, from time to time to see a character driven movie. A movie with no gimmick, no real plot, only characters that tie it together. These movies usually have more than one main character, lots of dialog, and most importantly, they can go anywhere. The characters can jump in a plane and fly to Antarctica if the want to. It is this feeling of open-ness that makes such movies feel so good. As Good as it Gets is one of these movies. Because the movie is character driven, we feel anything can happen.  As Good as it Gets has some of the best characters I have ever seen. There is no real plot. If I had to say what the plot was I would say it's about a crazy jerk who tries to change himself. But that doesn't even come close to describing this movie.   One reason why I love this movie is that I can really identify with the main character, Melvin Udall, played with shear brilliance by Jack Nicholson. You see, I am a little obsessive-compulsive. Not enough to warrant medication, just enough to know I have it. As I have said before in other reviews, I love movies about crazy people. And Melvin is about as crazy as they come. I can really understand why he locks and unlocks his door ten times overtime he comes home. I can understand why he wants to have the same waitress serve him breakfast every day. Obsessive-compulsive people love routine and if anything gets in the way of their routine, they feel violated. They not only want everyday to be like the last, they need it that way.  The acting in this movie is the best I have ever seen in one movie. The cast was perfect. No one plays a better lunatic than Jack Nicholson. The man is so good mer words can not express it. Helen Hunt is great as the cruel, stressful yet sensitive waitress. She deserves the Oscar for this and she has become one of my favorite actresses. Cuba Gooding Jr. has a small part, but he works it beautifully. Greg Kinnear is great as the sensitive and confused gay painter. Even Yeardly Smith (who some of you may know as Lisa from The Simpsons) is good. That just shows how good James L. Brooks is. He assembles on of the greatest casts ever and he directs them with grace and beauty.  Speaking of James L. Brooks, he and Mark Andus have made on of the funniest scripts of all time. This movie has some of the best one-liners I have ever heard (most of which come from Melvin). The dialog is great. This is some of the funniest writing I have ever heard.  Example:   Melvin- Never, never, interrupt me, okay? Not if there's a fire, not even if you hear the sound of a thud from my home and one week later there's a smell coming from there that can only be a decaying human body and you have to hold a hanky to your face because the stench is so thick that you think you're going to faint. Even then, don't come knocking. Or, if it's election night, and you're excited and you wanna celebrate because some fudgepacker that you date has been elected the first queer president of the United States and he's going to have you down to Camp David, and you want someone to share the moment with. Even then, don't knock. Not on this door. Not for ANY reason. Do you get me, sweetheart?  The movie even reminds me of The Simpsons. James L. Brooks is a producer for that show (which in my opinion is the greatest show of all time) and As Good as it Gets is filled with the same sudden, jab to the head type humor of The Simpsons. No, there is no other similarity, it's just that both seem to have the same comic timing.  In conclusion, this is one of my favorite movies and is definitely a classic. I normally hate softy romantic movies. The only thing is As Good as it Gets is anything but a softy romantic movie. Sure the movie has romance. It is, mostly, a love story. But it is NOT soft. It is very hilarious. Melvin is a cranky, brutally honest, meticulous, eccentric man and it is hilarious to watch him. I recommend this to anyone. It's a sweet, intelligent, deep, fresh, funny, and original movie that will continue to entertain me for years to come.   Normally, I believe that every one has an opinion. If I like a movie and you don't, so be it. But, if you don't like this movie, well, I can say with APSOLUTE accuracy that you have no taste. Sorry, you don't.  9/10\", \"This movie is just as good as it gets. I saw it once more last night on late TV and couldn\\u00b4t stop watching even though I\\u00b4ve seen it 2 or 3 times already. You just can\\u00b4t get tired of it and there\\u00b4s not a lot of movies you can say that about. Jack Nicholson and all the cast are excellent. I give it a 10.\", \"As Good as it Gets was really a funny romantic comedy just like I expected. The movie focuses around the character of Melvin (Jack Nicholson) a superstitous, bigot, and writer. He then meets a waitress (Helen Hunt) and his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and they all form a friendship with each other. As Good as it Gets got me hooked from the start. I like Jack Nicholson and Greg Kinnear. The two are paired with Helen Hunt and what comes out is a great, romantic comedy. There are some parts that are draggy but everything else is just great.  9/10\", \"The two leading actors here just own the film. There are so many memorable scenes, its full of drama yet is a great comedy.  Lets face it Jack Nicholson was made for the part, and he says things that I would love to do but never have the balls, yet he is incredibly dry.  The scene where one of his fans, a stereotypical dumb blonde (he's a writer) asks him how he writes women so well, 'I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.' LOL!\", \"My main quarrel with romance movies is that they are targeted for a specific audience (females 18-30) and from working in a video store that is the demographic who rents them. This movie I could watch with just about anyone, as it is a perfect balance of comedy, good drama, and romance, with great acting by everyone, and good directing as well. Call it a chick flick if you want, but it does not disappoint, 'Excuse me there are JEWS at my table' hahahahaha (by the way im jewish)\", \"among the best 3 movies of 1997, along with good will hunting & l.a.confidential. this movie has 3 top artistes giving off their best. the story is simple, and yet so complex. the characters are out-of-the-world and yet so real. as good as it gets revels in this paradox.  touching at the raw chords, a story of a man who cannot (or rather does not want to) reveal his emotions. helen hunt plays the woman that turns him around, the one person who makes him \\\"want to be a better man\\\". greg kinear plays a brilliant role as the gay friend. he would have bagged the oscars in most years, his tough luck that he ran into robin williams giving his career best performance in good will hunting.  as good as it gets is funny, endearing, touching, dark, sad, cathartic, confusing and enlightening all at once. one of the modern masterpieces. the casting director deserves a special award for this casting coup. watch the movie for the brilliant performances, the arresting chemistry between these superstars, the heart-rending moments between them. this is one of the best movies of the 90s.  A deserving 9.\", \"I enjoyed the film greatly. It is extraordinary clever and witty with original, incredibly amusing dialogues. I didn't want any action in the movie: it was enough just to look at the characters and to listen to their speaking. Besides, it's very moving: background is highly dramatic, though on the surface you find the funniest comedy. The real life is like that, you know \\u0096 a short way from tragedy to the farce. The plot twists unexpectedly but so naturally that I never doubted the possibility of such events. Actors' works are outstanding. Jack Nicholson is the unique actor, he gives an unforgettable performer as Melvin Udall. Helen Hunt is excellent: expressive, spirited, and stylish. You feel every emotion of Carol and sympathize with her. Greg Kinnear showed all his abilities in the part of Simon \\u0096 the most convincing and likable gay character I've ever seen. I also admire Shirley Knight as Carol's mother \\u0096 perfect! My favourite moment is that at the end of the movie where she listens behind the door and suddenly pops out to explain that `normal boyfriends' don't exist. It was great \\u0096 so funny and so true! According to the story there is no such thing as `normal people' in the world, we are all crazy. So never mind being crazy \\u0096 life is just as good as it gets! Both of lead actors deserved their Oscars, however two awards are too little for such film. At least, screenwriter and director must have had Oscars. And why there is no special award for `the best animal in the film'? Verdel is an irresistibly attractive creature, and so talented! The film entertains you and touches your heart deeply, makes you smile, laugh and cry, but never depress or bore. 10/10 in every sense.\", \"This film is really not about anything. It starts off simply introducing some of the characters who you will soon never forget. We are immediately introduced to a crumudgen named Melvin played by Jack Nicholson.  Melvin in short is a SOB. He is rude, racist, paranoid, homophobic, and just a horrible person. Our first introduction to him we wittness him taking his gay neighbour's dog running around and chucking it down the garbage chute.  When Simon finds out (played by Greg Kineear) he decides to take a stand but is so intimidated by Melvin's antics that even when he tries to confront him he just breaks down. This also leads to a diatribe Melvin says to Simon that is so brutal that you can't help but feel bad but laugh at hystericaly.  This is pretty much the pace of the film. All the characters have their shining moment. Melvin has several, Simon has many, and even Simon's lover played by Cuba Gooding Jr. has a great confrontation scene with Melvin telling him to lay off Simon.  There is a reason for Melvin's antics, which isn't explained until about 1/2 way through the film, and that is he has OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). In short this is a bit of a flaw cause it makes the viewer not sympathize with Melvin right away. Instead many people witnessing his antics may just end up hating him so much cause his behaviour is without reason, (walking in to the same restaurant every day, at the exact time, demanding to be served by the same waitress [Helen Hunt], bringing his own plastic cutlery, while bad mouthing everyone else in the place is a good example). When he finally gets kicked out by the owner all the patrons stand up and cheer. To some degree that may be the reaction some people watching this film may have by walking out of this film before its even 1/4 through. It's a testament to Jack's performance for creating someone who is truly an absolute unbearable person to witness. Melvin seems VERY real..  But in short all these characters come together in the end out of bizarre circumstances and life changes for the better. It's an enjoyable film, with some great performances particularly for Jack's best actor performance, and Kineear's wounded likes of Simon.  The film also has a very well trained memorable dog that is amazing in its personality. This dog even has better acting chops than most actors in films I have seen! The film does try to create a romance between Melvin and the waitress which is OK but gets a bit overlong (the restaurant scene is a bit lengthy), but still highly recommended  Great feel good film.  Rating 8 out of 10.\", \"James L. Brooks is a man with a gift for developing interesting characters but with a weakness for squeezing them into cliched and/or manipulative circumstances. When obsessive compulsive Jack Nicholson pays for Helen Hunt's seriously ill son's medical expenses just so she won't have to stop being his waitress, the movie flows along with a lot of invention and energy. But then the movie becomes another one of those dangerous romantic fantasies where an unlikable guy is \\\"cured\\\" of his xenophobia by the love of a good woman.  At the beginning the racist, sexist, and homophobic jokes made by Nicholson are played for laughs, which is fine for the movie's purposes, but then Brooks expects us to feel threatened by the exact same type of comments and then warmhearted when he tries to change his ways. Who cares about a bigoted old man's happiness?  The movie goes a lot into Hunt's devotion to her son but does she really think Nicholson would make a good father figure? Hunt and Nicholson falling in love is an easy out because then Brooks doesn't really have to deal with the more difficult (and more interesting) ideas brought up in the first half.  So is the movie actually good? Well, sure. It's quirkier than most romantic comedies (if you want to call it that) but it's disappointing intellectually in the end. Soooooooo, *** out of ****\", \"\\\"As Good as it Gets\\\" shows that comedies can have something more than laughs and silliness.  Jack Nicholson (playing Melvin Udall, a very unusual man) and Helen Hunt (playing Carol, a very nice waitress and an ordinary person) really deserved the Oscar. I've already known that Nicholson was a great actor, but Helen surprised me. She's a wonderful and graceful actress; one of my favorite ones. Her character has the gift to change the life of a cold and boring man like Melvin. I think Greg Kinnear should have won the Oscar (he's much more better than Robin Williams).  I can compare \\\"As Good as it Gets\\\" with another great comedy released recently - \\\"Notting Hill\\\". They both show you the disabilities and the joy of ordinary people (even if he is a maniac man, like Melvin Udall, or the most famous movie star, like Anna Scott - Julia Roberts - in \\\"Notting Hill\\\").  I think this film wouldn't be very good with other actors, but it's a very human comedy and it had the attention it deserved.  9/10\", \"I have to say that after watching this movie the first time, I totally enjoyed it. Second viewing was somewhat bored but still liked it. By the third viewing, I noticed it was too long, some scenes were boring and pointless and I\\\"m sick of the male lead being 30 years older than the female lead. Nonetheless:good acting, good dialouge(for the most part), good direction, but after repeat viewing the movie doesnt hold its strength.\", \"A story of messed up real life people trying to find a happy hollywood ending, almost real life for a change.  Nicholson is fantastic getting all the quick witted replies and comments that he deserves, and Hunt provides a fantastic lead opposite him and the pair blend beautifully together in their scenes.  Gooding and Kinnear provide strong support, but it's Kinnear who outshines Gooding, why haven't we seen him in more prominent roles before?  The film can get a bit sappy in places, but it always brings it back to reality with a bang.  Definately a go see, for all those Victor Meldrew types.\", \"As Good as it Gets is a very funny movie, filled with great acting and lines that always hit the mark p-e-r-f-e-c-t-l-y... Jack Nicholson is absolutely perfect, and Helen Hunt proves that she can do better than playing in Twister... Greg Kinnear is also very convincing in his role. The Oscar-cursed Cuba Gooding Jr. gives one of his last good performances, if not THE last one... Great movie...  85%\", \"This is a touching film because it's centred on a man that you will initially dislike and may continue to dislike. That doesn't matter though because it's about non-conformists being able to fall in love without sacrificing their individuality. That's what sets it apart from your typical romantic slush: this is the most genuine, uplifting film I have seen in ages. It isn't formulaic, and it works: future script-writers take note!\", \"A telly-familiar face from the production crew of the Simpsons series, James L. Brooks, directs a 5-year old screenplay and rakes up a pretentious cast of actors. The original script has been written by Mark Andrus in 1992, and has been developed differently from its origin in 5 years time by the director James L. Brooks. The length of the time passed in between this period has surely deprived the efficiency of its editing. Hence, we shouldn't have expected a good relation between the storyline and the plot. Thankfully, James L. Brooks hasn't even put a plot on view. So we get a simple sit-com entirely tied to the actors' contribution in this comedy/family movie.   When a movie goes nowhere via its point, comedy is the easiest cure to make it find a way. Consider a horror movie, you watch it but you don't feel any fear; in order to be meant for something, a horror can be cured with some comedy, that way can it only become interesting. On the other hand, comedy is the hardest cure to make a point-lost movie find a way; 'cause you gotta have Oscar worthy performances at least to make it worth to watch. As Good As It Gets is the worst movie of 1997 with its technical features:  Editing is the worst, screenplay is a mess, no camera aspects, no successful sound editing or mixing(no one has no idea how can a puppy murmur through a garbage chute and can be heard inside an apartment unit), art decoration has zero achievement(that's why it's a sit-com) ; at the same time As Good As It Gets is at its best for 4 great performances: Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson at the leading, Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr. at the supporting. If a Hollywood movie is just leaning upon its cast, why watching Hollywood then?   As Good As It Gets absolutely deserved its 2 actor-based Oscars and in total 3 actor-based nominations. The other 4 nominations are a fine cods-wallop!   Priggery and meticulousness are very well staged by Nicholson, playing a quirky character at the culminating point of capturing viewers' attention, reminding us of Bart Simpson at age 60; especially with his style of walking crab-wise on the street. Helen Hunt plays and heartens a mother of a sick child within bearing of her vicissitude of fortune at one side, bearing Jack Nicholson as the menace of her emotional argument at the opposite side. Cuba Gooding Jr. is a self-assertive individual and the only person in the movie who can deliver a replication to Nicholson. Additionally, Greg Kinnear is the gingerbread of the movie playing the beaten and robbed gay artist. Because each one of the actors has a complete different view of life, the non-plotted script magnetizes us growing our curiosity on if they ever roll up like a hedgehog together.   As Good As It Gets made me want to watch Seinfeld. Based upon same idea, to play along with each other, Seinfeld is much much more better than this one of its analogous. There is absolutely no technical feature to make As Good As It Gets a worth-watching movie. It is likable only for its remarkable acting.\", \"Now I know what good acting means. You are absolutely surrounded with it in this movie. There is not a single actor or actress in this movie that didn't exceed himself/herself. Helen Hunt is great (I don;t know why, but I find her quite attractive) and I won't bore you about the performance given by Jack Nicholson. When I first saw this movie I thought it was really boring and overrated, but I saw it again the second day and immediately loved it. Maybe the ending is a little bogus, but it's a romantic comedy, so it didn't bother me that much. A fairly complicated plot presented with ease and simplicity works perfectly and there's a nostalgic tone to the movie in whole. Maybe because it's a rare occasion nowadays to come across a movie that isn't stuffed with special effects. This is a movie that should be seen on a beautiful day, when you're in a good mood.   Great fun that keeps getting better and better each time I see it. A strong 8/10.\", \"Directed by Oscar nominee James L. Brooks, the story written by Mark Andrus brings up not only very interesting characters but also very interesting issues. I have the video and enjoy watching it. The CD is great with music of Nat King Cole, Shawn Colkin. Outstanding acting by Helen Hunt (Mad About You, Twister) who won an Oscar for this role where she plays Carol Connelly, a single mother, working as waitress in Manhattan, New York. A single parent trying to cope with her work and paying medical bills for son Spencer Connelly, played by Jesse James (Message in a Bottle, The Gingerbread Men, Gods and Monsters). Jack Nicholson (A Few Good Men, Easy Rider, Witches of Eastwick) is Melvin Udall who is an obsessive compulsive. Nicholson also won an Oscar for his part. His obsessive compulsiveness has taken over his life and he is not able to live a normal life. Melvin Udall has tons of soap all organized in his medicine cabinet. He uses a bar of soap once and then throws it out. He will not step on a crack on the side walk but skips to the next block of concrete. When he goes to the restaurant he brings his own plastic fork, knife and spoon in a plastic bag. Udall uses plastic gloves to hold the dog and has all his office supply stacked and all color coordinated in his home/office. He eats at the same restaurant, sits at the same table, if someone is seating at his table he insults them to make them leave so that he has his table back, wants the same waiter Carol to wait on him, and takes forever to take a shower. He closes his door several times and counts how many times he has done it. As a writer who works at home I do understand Mr. Udall really well. Writers think somewhat like this: we like to be alone with ourselves in order to think. We have to go inside ourselves to produce good work. It is a very isolated world. We do not like to be bothered unless we are bored, or tired, in which case we want to communicate with the outside world for a brief period of time, then after one hour or so we want to go back inside ourselves again and be left alone. This is somehow like Melvin thinks. People think that he has nothing to do and they keep knocking at his door and he gets really aggravated about that. He is my favorite character in this movie, not to diminish the other ones. He is just so full on nuances that make him very entertaining. Helen's role is very, very, good and she did a really good job with it. Greg Kinnear (Sabrina) is Simon Bishop, the artist who is Udall's next door neighbor who finally has Melvin turning into a little more normal human being and he is there to teach him many life lessons. The supporting actors are great, you have Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. (Jerry Maguire) playing Frank Sachs, Simon's agent.  My favorite scenes: elementary school kids all in uniform screaming: \\\"Wait! Melvin, wait\\\"! Greg Kinnear imitating Melvin. Melvin and Caroll going to eat fresh rolls in the wee hours of the morning. When Melvin realizes that the dog is also skipping cracks on the sidewalk.  My favorite quote: \\\"I am drowning here and you are describing the water.\\\" This is a nice story telling movie. I recommend it!\", \"This movie is bizarre because, while judged overall its story is shmaltzy and unbelievable, nevertheless each individual scene plays absolutely convincingly and feels very real. It's weird. I don't know if it's just the greatness of the actors overcoming an under-thought out script, or whether it's just the script concentrated solely on crafting great scenes one after the other, but not so much in coming up with a convincing through-line. Whatever. All I know is that this is one of the most entertaining pictures I've ever seen, extremely funny and quite emotionally affecting in places. Somehow, it just doesn't matter - I like it anyway.  The performances are uniformly excellent. Nicholson shows real range here - sure, he gets to be the sarcastic curmudgeon we've all come to expect, but his character also has moments of fear, repression and vulnerability which he brings off equally well. My problem with this character (and the \\\"problem\\\" only exists as I think about him afterward, not while I'm actually watching the movie) is in his conception: he seems to be whatever the writers want him to be at that moment, with no particular consistency from scene to scene so when he supposedly \\\"changes\\\" at the end, we're left to think, \\\"Change? This guy's been changing through the entire movie!\\\" And also, the fact that his character is a romance novelist is never really explained or examined in any way.  And yet, Nicholson's performance makes it not matter quite so much.  Helen Hunt is a revelation in this movie - she nails every scene she's in, whether she's forced to be witty, embarrassed, angry, defiant, emotionally overwhelmed, whatever. She keeps Jack on his toes, and they work off each other brilliantly. Also, I never thought I'd find myself saying this, but Greg Kinnear was great as Simon, the gay neighbor. (It was also nice to see director Harold Ramis - the third Ghostbuster, after all - in front of the camera again, if only briefly, in a small part as a doctor.)  What more can I say? Good comedy, good love story, great acting. None of it, in the end, is very convincing, but if you just focus on the individual moments and not on the grand design - a task made easy by the wonderful writing and playing - it's very easy to like As Good As It Gets.\", \"As Good As It Gets is one of those incredibly moving films that is also hugely entertaining. It's not just a comedy, you can't quite label it a drama piece, it just is what it is; simply great.  What works here so well are the actors and the script. Nicholson and Hunt both won Oscars and they're simply great but Kinnear is no less effective as Nicholson gay neighbour. Plus that dog is amazing as well. This film really relies on great performances and there's no shortage of that here.  As Good As It Gets is also remarkably well written. So well defined characters and completely involving, you quite simply grow to love them and sympathize with their plight. Nicholson's remarks are terrific, each one very quotable (personal fav; I think of a man and I take away reason and accountability).  Direction is first rate, Brooks made Terms of Endearment so it's well established that he's quite capable of making great films. As Good As It Gets is very nearly as good it gets.\", \"Jack Nicholson is one of those actors who impresses me the second (and I'm not overstating in the least bit) he appears on screen. The moment I see Jack's face on screen, I get this feeling that everything's going to be all right. He could do a Pauly Shore film, and elevate its quality with his mere presence. And I didn't even get to his acting.  Nicholson won a well-deserved Oscar for this movie. Then again, I feel like he deserves an Oscar for virtually everything he's been in. Hell, you can even give him an Oscar nod for \\\"Anger Management.\\\" THAT'S how great he is! He's one of those actors who can communicate even more emotion when he's not saying anything than when he is. And of course, he has one of the coolest movie star voices ever, so it makes it a joy whenever he does speak. I still feel like \\\"You can't handle the truth!\\\" wouldn't be as priceless a line if Jack didn't yell it. He can say almost any line of dialogue and turn it into gold. In this movie it was \\\"You make me wanna be a better man.\\\" Again, an otherwise forgettable line of dialogue made gold by Jack.  \\\"As Good As It Gets\\\" is a flawed film, with scenes that drag and an overlong running time, but it's highly enjoyable and altogether pretty well-written. Aside from its many hilarious moments, it's also quite touching. But I have to admit that it's the comedy that sticks out most in my memory. There's some priceless gags like when a Jewish couple is sitting at Jack's usual table. He first intrudes into their conversation saying, \\\"People who speak in metaphors oughtta shampoo my crotch.\\\" He complains to Helen Hunt, his usual waitress, saying \\\"I have Jews at my table!\\\" He then intrudes in the couple's conversation again, noticing the food on their table, saying \\\"Obviously your appetites aren't as big as your noses.\\\" Now, I probably wouldn't want to personally know a man like Melvin in my real life, but I still found those cracks to be hysterically funny. The same when he attacks Greg Kinnear's gay character with constant homosexual slurs.  The performances are great all-around. Though Jack pretty much steals the show, Greg Kinnear gives a wonderfully endearing performance. He doesn't play out the gay stereotypes, yet he's sensitive and feminine enough to have me convinced that he is gay (unlike Eric McCormack on \\\"Will and Grace\\\" who acts like he's gay for the sake of the show's gimmick). It's nice to see Kinnear rise from the host of \\\"Talk Soup\\\" and the thankless late night talk show \\\"Later\\\" to a fine actor. Previously, I wouldn't have any notion that he could become what he is now. Helen Hunt also gives a compelling, emotionally packed performance. And Shirley Knight, as her mother, provides a little bit of comic relief. Cuba Gooding Jr. has a small but interesting role, and he makes the best of it.  The film does have its dull moments, but Jack's one-of-a-kind performance makes it all worthwhile. There is nobody, and I mean NOBODY, who could've played Melvin better than him. I read in the trivia that John Travolta was originally offered the role. Now, I like Travolta, but in this type of role he wouldn't hold a candle to Jack.  My score: 7 (out of 10)\", \"Comedies (especially romantic comedies) can only be judged by how much they make you laugh and if they make you feel good inside. As Good As It Gets does it for me every time. I'm not just saying this on account of being a \\\"Jack fan.\\\" The characters are so beautifully drawn, you forget it's just Jamie from \\\"Mad About You\\\" (Helen Hunt) and the man with the eyebrows (Nicholson). This movie deserved all of its Oscars, and then some. The role of an obsessive-compulsive is an easy one to parody and mock to death, but Jack does it with style, humour, emotion, and that usual Nicholson flair. Hunt has never been better as a waitress with a major anxiety to do something for herself for a change. Greg Kinnear is also very good as a gay artist that ends up having to turn to the irascible Jack for help after he is scarred and left destitute following a break-in. This is such a special comedy, fresh from the pen of James L. Brooks, the man behind the wonderful Terms of Endearment (another wonderful Nicholson performance) and Broadcast News. As Good As It Gets made me feel so good, even though I couldn't really relate to the characters' situations. The humor is pure Jack, set to the script with perfect ease. The emotions evoked by the actors are also authentic and heart-felt, as if they love what they are acting out. Movies like this come few and far between, and that is the reason why I appreciate this film so very much. As Good As It Gets was one of the best films of 1997. Rating: Four stars.\", \"\\\"As Good As It Gets\\\" boasts a splendid, delightful combination of wonderful, zesty acting and a remarkably bright and effective screenplay. Jack Nicholson is pitch-perfect as the obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon Melvin Udall, who possesses some of the strangest and most curious tendencies ever concocted by screenwriters; his Udall is so human, so heartfelt, so genuine, and so whimsical and Nicholson perfects him to such a degree that not a moment of his screen time is unwanted or uninteresting: in my valid opinion, this is Nicholson's best performance of his career, and one of the most reverent performances in film history. What an engaging, enthralling story: an troubled, insecure man helps a troubled, insecure waitress (troubled and insecure in different respects), and the two form an unlikely relationship from being distant acquaintances (Hunt even exclaims that Nicholson is crazy in their most uncomfortable moment in the film) to practical soul mates (Nicholson to Hunt: \\\"I feel that I'm the only person that knows that you are the greatest woman alive\\\"), through a series of misfortunes, self-explorations, and mutual bondings. Kinnear's character Simon has the distinct purpose in being both the bridge and the divider of Nicholson and Hunt's relationship, and he identifies with his character with compassion and understanding, as he has frequently been wronged throughout his existence. The most curious aspect to a story such as this, involving such unduly, diverse characters: a miserable recluse, a zesty, yet insecure waitress, and a sensitive and insightful, yet wronged homosexual, is that in their distinct differences, they share many of the same problems, and these problems eventually bring them all together, although hardly in a civilized manner. I appreciated practically every element in this wonderful, delightful masterpiece of exemplary romantic comedy, in its indelible acting (Oscars well deserved), its whimsical, touching screenplay (This was neons above \\\"Good Will Hunting\\\"'s quality) and its comforting morale, that despite all of the great odds in life which prevent us from being happy, we can perhaps find it within ourselves to take that one important step in reversing our fortunes, in \\\"stopping with taking pills\\\" and to allow our lives, and our desires to shine and be realized, as this story depicts life. The best romantic comedy, certainly the best film of 1997, and one of the greatest films of all time, \\\"As Good As It Gets\\\" succeeds in practically every entertaining and endearing cinematic respect. **** out of ****\", \"Really, how to make something original, fresh and odd out of absolutely nothing except a few characters? Using characters, only characters and nothing except characters. That's the simple formula Brooks uses in all of his work, but, for me, he has never created so much charm, warmth and sensibility as he did in `As good as it gets'.  Characters write the screenplay in this movie, and everything that happens - happens because of what they are. They are nothing special \\u0096 they are ordinary people we meet in the street every day and that have the same problems a lot of other people have. This movie presents the example of how much you can pull out of that. And if that is written as well as it is in this case, not even a happy ending can bother you. Because, in real life, shown here, what is the end?  Everything is good and warm in this movie, everything is fresh and vivacious, understandable and well performed. Jack Nicholson brings one of the best performances of his career, that terrific Helen Hunt finally got a chance to show how skilfully an actor can connect naturalism with the laws of the camera performance, and Greg Kinnear shows the most convincing emotions coming from a gay character I've ever seen.  The relationships between the characters are created in the way that you can't predict anything that's going to happen, eventhough you know in advance what could come out of their mouth and what kind of attitude they'll have in a certain situation.  You can simply feel the progressive collaboration that occurred between Brooks and the actors and the mutual understanding they developed, and it's not often that you see that kind of artistic superstructure shining on the screen so much as it does here.  I find `As good as it gets' complexed, vital, intelligent, emotionally deep and studied, fresh, original, amusing, cheerful, funny, and one of the best films of 1997.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Assassins\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0112401\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"A Walk to Remember\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0281358\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Back to the Future\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0088763\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Badlands\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0069762\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0086856\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"Director W.D. Richter's THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI is sort of hip, and kind of cool, but really isn't as good as it could be.  It certainly starts out well enough. The opening credit graphics, and Music by Michael Boddicker, set a rousing tone for a grand, comic book style adventure.  An opening story background \\\"crawl\\\", ala \\\"Star Wars\\\" lets us know about Buckaroo, played by Peter Weller (\\\"Robocop\\\"), and his mixed background (U.S. father, Japanese mother) his varied interests (neurosurgery, martial arts, particle physics), and the fact that he makes music with his off beat friends, those \\\"hard rocking scientists, The Hong Kong Cavaliers\\\".  Without wasting time, Director Richter plunges into the action. At the salt flats, team Banzai prepares to launch its rocket car. The problem is, of' Buckaroo is not present and accounted for. That's 'cause multi-talented Buckaroo (Weller) is busy recruiting Jeff Goldblum (\\\"Jurassic Park\\\"), a top surgeon, who is performing an operation. After asking Goldblum to join his group, Weller inquires, \\\"Can you sing?\\\" Goldblum responds, \\\"A little... I can dance.\\\"  Soon Weller, dressed in a black, Ninja-style firesuit shows up at the salt flats. When Weller gets in the jet car, the film really takes off, literally and figuratively. When Weller goes off course, it appears he's going to slam right into a mountain. Instead, a blue beam from the jet car zaps the mountain, and then the jet car goes into the mountain. Instead of crashing, it enters a weird 8th dimension. We see a strange landscape, and unusual creatures, some human-like, some not. Soon, Weller and his jet car come out the other side of the mountain, unharmed. In this sequence, Richter and Director of Photography, Fred J. Koenekamp, really delivers the Sci-Fi excitement goods. This is my favorite scene in the film.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie never again reaches this level of fun and entertainment. The rest of the film is a mishmash of aliens, a mad scientist (John\\\"Cliffhanger\\\" Lithgow at his most excessive) and a \\\"lost soul\\\" girl named Penny, played by Ellen Barkin (\\\"Sea of Love\\\") in an early, non-impressive performance.  The main problems lie with the Screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch. His biggest mistake is that darn jet car sequence. The much acclaimed film \\\"Bullitt\\\" has its famous chase scene well into the film, which makes it all the more satisfying when it arrives. By contrast, THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI by having it's exciting jet car sequence first, gives filmmaker Richter nowhere to go but down.  Another problem is the Hong Kong Cavaliers themselves. Other than Jeff Goldblum, they are a faceless lot, not very well fleshed out, and with little to do. Weller, as Buckaroo, is the whole show, and the rest seem like a Superstar's hangers on: perhaps important to him, but not interesting to the viewer.  THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI is like a Chinese dinner: an hour later you're hungry for a more substantial film. All you remember is the opening jet car scene and the cool music.  THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI should be watchable for both undemanding Sci-Fi fans and the small fry, who may get a kick out of the aliens. Banzai!\", \"A scientist/rock n' roller/brain surgeon/samurai fights evil aliens named John from the 8th dimension.  My Rating: Severe Eyebrow Twitch Warning My Review: In the cult movie world, there is The Rocky Horror Picture Show and then Buckaroo Banzai. These two films have the largest cult followings of any of the strange flicks we present on our page, and for a good reason. . . although I'm not quite sure what that is.Buckaroo is odd. Very odd. So odd that you might be rewinding at the beginning going, \\\"What the flippin' flapjack did I miss?\\\" You didn't miss anything, patient viewer, this movie is out to mess with your mind. I read once that the best way to explain this movie is to compare it to jumping in to the middle of a series of movies. You feel like this is Part 6 of something, since it doesn't start at the beginning. I like that explanation, so I'll leave it at that. You must have a blank, tabula rasa mind watching this. Just be a conformist: accept what is happening and go with it! Buckaroo (Robocop, er, Peter Weller), a Jack-Of-All-Trades, is currently riding his rocket car into the 8th dimension, inhabited by bad dudes all named John. They come to earth and try to fight us, but Buckaroo and his Hong Kong Cavaliers are there to stop them. I feel so funky trying to explain this... it's like trying to explain a dream that really made deep sense to you while it was happening, but no one is really going to know what you are talking about in the morning: \\\"And so, this snail gave me a hug, right, and said I was from the Land of the Lollipop People! Can you believe that?  I personally didn't find this film as engrossing as other famous cult movies, but it wasn't bad. Just very disjointed and nonsensical. There are a lot of great, great lines, including the famous: \\\"No matter where you go, there you are.\\\" Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Lloyd, and John Lithgow join the cast (I didn't even have to look up their names! I'm so proud of myself, > like when the giant snail came up to me...). Definitely worth a rent, even better at a party of your bizarre friends. Sure you have bizarre friends, right? If you don't call us and we'll send a couple of us mutants over to your place for company.  Recommended for: Comic Book Fans College students that just can't make up their minds as to what they want to be: be everything!  \", \"I can only describe this film as one of the delightfully insane motion pictures ever made. Weller,Goldblum, and Lithgow were all in magnificent form, while the script is a hilarious, surreal masterpiece of heroic absurdity. I've always wanted the sequel to appear, but I realize that that's as likely as a new Twin Peaks film or restorations of The Magnificent Ambersons or Greed. One last thing: I AM New Jersey!\", \"This movie didn't do well at the box office and was not a commercial success by any means. It was, in my opinion, one of the best comic-book-to-movie films ever done. With such a wealth of material to draw on, I don't know how Richter was able to keep the running time under 3 hours!  I caught the Banzi band wagon a little late in the game (first viewed it on tape around 1986) and have seen it about 3 times but never seem to tire of it's subtle (and overt) humor, colorful and well formed characters, clever and original premise and terrific ensemble cast!  All I want to know is:  WHERE'S THE SEQUEL THEY PROMISED US AT THE END?!! (8/10)\", \"This movie is not meant to be taken seriously. It is serious fun.

Stocked with a cast of actors and actresses who were all on the verge of becoming big, \\\"Banzai\\\" is just plain fun. A pulp character that was never printed in pulp magazines brought to life, a Doc Savage for the 80's, Buckaroo is something you watch for pure enjoyment, not personal enlightenment.\", \"Well, first off - Buckaroo Bonzai is not a great film - what it is - is a amusing, silly sci-fi romp that pretty much spoofs the whole concepts of sci-fi / screaming mad aliens / with an implausible plot and a comic book continuity. But frankly, who cares. There a dead pan looks, sight gags, puns, bad costumes, and a list of stars that makes you blink twice trying to understand how they got these people to agree to do this movie. And that's the key - its just a group of people with a bad suits and wacked out lines trying to push the serious sci-fi concept out the window and have goofy fun with firearms and technology.\", \"The authors had to be under the influence of chemicals that are not normally present in the body (perhaps something from the 8th dimension). It's a rare style of movie in that while the characters take themselves seriously, the movie does not. This movie really makes no sense, but you don't want to watch it if it has to make sense. It's a series of moments. If you try to go linking them together to form a plot, you will fail miserably. So just enjoy.

This is a film that had the difficult task of creating a superhero whole-cloth with 100 minutes to do it in. All other hero films (Tarzan, Superman, Batman, The Phantom, The Shadow, Doc Savage) already had their mythos firmly established in print: not so with Buckaroo. They had to start at ground zero and explain everything in as little time as possible while giving you the film's own story: a very formidibal task.  Then the money behind the pic got insulted. He (whoever he is) felt that the theatrical release slammed him and was personally insulting: that's why the film was in the theatres for all of a week or so. No PR, no theatre run time: miserable flop.  I'm unapologetic: I think the story is great. An fantastic take on Orson Welle's War of the Worlds radio broadcast, a truly all-star cast, alien Rastafarians, the jet car, some pretty good blue screen work on the cobbled-together Lectroid ship, and true love triumphing over death itself, not to mention one of the coolest end title sequences I've ever seen! (I will fault the lighting on the parachute sequence)  I think it was quite commendable, and a film truly worthy of the cult status it has attained with the science fiction fans. I attend San Diego ComiCon every year, and every year I see Banzai t-shirts for sale along with all sorts of other merchandise.  I only hope that the Fox series pilot is accepted, broadcasted, and becomes a moderately successful series, as that would give me a slight chance of someday getting the movie on digital media.  Tanno Banzai!\", \"Absolutely one of the most memorable movies from my teens, only eclipsed by the star wars movies, tron and alien..... I think the line that keeps coming forward into my brain most would be, \\\"Why is there a watermelon there?\\\" - Jeff Goldblum, upon entering the lab....pretty much sums this movie up. What boggles my mind the most about this movie is the fact that if you ask someone if they have seen it, they probably haven't - but say, \\\"Remember, no matter where you go.....\\\", they will most likely finish the quote for you.......\\\"there you are.\\\" Inconcievable.\", \"A good, if not great, cult film starring Peter Weller as the jack-of-all-trades superhero. Great performances by John Lithgow and Jeff Goldblum in supporting roles. Lithgow in particular is good as a scientist driven mad by the eighth dimension. Many quotable lines make this movie a fun one to watch over again. A sequel advertised at the end of the movie evidently never made it into production.\", \"A movie that is easy to watch, funny and fun and still allows so many big names a little early days fun. Even is Sci-Fi is not your thing, if you liked Hitchhiker's Guide and Fifth Element, you want to see this movie.  This title has to come to DVD some day. When it does, get it!\", \"Buckaroo Banzai is quite simply the most fun movie you'll ever watch. Romance, aliens, high-technology, and gun-toting rock star techno-geniuses--how can a movie like this possibly go wrong?\", \"Buckaroo Bonzai is not a movie for everyone. I thought it was great fun, myself. It is sort of a Doc Savage spoof. It doesn't even take itself too seriously, but the humor in many places is very subtle. If one was not familiar with Doc Savage or any of the other pulp heroes, then that person may just look at the movie and wonder what it was about. But for the thinking person who likes some subtlety in their shows, it is perfect.\", \"It's right up there with another of my favorites, \\\"Big Trouble in Little China\\\"! It takes a certain kind of person to enjoy this movie: You have to be open minded and like to be entertained.  I watch it every time it's on tv even though I own it on video. When I watched it for the first time, I thought I must have missed something. The movie seems to start in the middle of the story-like it's already on episode four. Which only makes it more fun!  If you're looking for meaning-take a Philosophy class. If ya wanna be entertained and have some fun-watch Buckaroo Banzai(or Big Trouble).  > I can't wait til they release this on DVD!!\", \"A super sci-fi movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but also doesn't get out of hand with being too ridiculous. The characters are extremely well played and the idea of the movie is unlike anything I had seen before. Men in Black and Matrix probably borrowed some of their ideas from this movie - it is fairly obvious. The credits are some of the most memorable and enjoyable I have seen. It also mentions a sequel, but apparently Buckaroo had better things to do, like become Robocop!\", \"'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai' nearly defies definition! A cult classic, this send-up of alien invasion stories, pulp fiction heroes, and adventure movies is a love/hate proposition; while I found it to be brilliant fun, many of my friends thought it was incomprehensible! One thing for sure...There is NO other film quite like it!   Buckaroo (played with laid-back coolness by Peter Weller) is a Japanese-American race car driver/neurosurgeon/rock star/comic book hero who, with his rock 'n roll commandos, The Hong Kong Cavaliers, balances his time between saving lives, pushing the boundaries of science, troubleshooting for the President, and playing gigs in nightclubs. The film careens from one climax to another, scarcely allowing the viewer time to think (which, in a film like this, may be a GOOD thing!). Director W.D. Richter deftly keeps the tone light, although there is a heartbreaking death scene tossed in.   Loaded with more imagination than any three films you can name, and a oddball sense of humor, to boot, 'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai' is a wonderful, wacky triumph, that challenges you to toss aside preconceptions, and 'enjoy the ride'!   I HIGHLY recommend it!  \", \"Unless you can approach a movie with an open mind and an eye for parody, stay far, far away from this film.  If you CAN approach the movie as noted above, this is a film you'll love. It would be hard to compare this to any other movie. It is sci-fi. It is 30s pulp fiction. It is adventure. It is comedy. And for the most part, it is a brilliant piece of work.  When Buckaroo discovers that aliens from another dimension are infiltrating our world, he and his intrepid band of engineers and scientists go on the job to investigate and correct the dangerous situation. The word band is not used lightly. In addition to their work beyond the frontiers of known science, they are also a music band with raving fans and groupies. LOL Just a wonderful escape into a truly different slant on things for a couple of hours. Highly recommended.\", \"There are, and always will be, differences of opinion about every movie. After reading the existing comments on this one I decided that one of the things causing those differences is the question of how many movies you've seen. I grew up in the 40s of the last century so I've seen an awful lot of movies. Maybe for that reason or maybe just because I'm a wacko, I tend to judge every movie at least partly for its relation to all the other movies I've seen.  Take \\\"Buckaroo,\\\" for example. It came out in 1984 containing some elements suggested by \\\"Dr. Strangelove\\\" (1964) and \\\"Superman II\\\" (1980).On the other hand, its driving force shows up again in \\\"Men In Black\\\" (1997). \\\"Sneakers\\\" (1992) shamelessly copies one of its principal sets, the background of one of the characters, its technological McGuffin and one scene right down to the dialog. One line by John Bigboote is hilariously adapted in every single episode of the BBC comedy series \\\"Keeping Up Appearances.\\\" Top that, \\\"Citizen Kane!\\\"\", \"Considering the success of \\\"Men in Black,\\\" Buckaroo should have at least been a moderate hit, in that it is no more or less strange and entertaining than that later sci-fi-alien-invading human cartoon. Buckaroo even has a better storyline (Orson Welles War of the Worlds broadcast of 1939 being genuine). Would Will Smith have made the difference? Perhaps a little more bathroom humor, a huge helping of added gratuitous violence, a female slapping all the men around, some thinly-veiled pejorative references to drug and tobacco companies, considerable sexual depravity and a homosexual hero would have elevated Buckaroo Banzai to the level of a neo-classic, a la Pulp Fiction.\", \"Another movie some people hate or love with good reason. If you aren't a sci-fi fan, you will likely hate Sci-Fi spoofs as you will not get much of the humour and aren't interested in the setting of the story!!....Galaxy Quest is similar...If you hate Star Trek and never watched it, why would you laugh at a Star Trek spoof? I like this movie, because John Lithgow is one of the funniest people alive(my opinion and taste), I get the jokes because I read the comics, watched the Sci Fi movies, like satire, lived the 80s, and like silly humour. 8 out of 10 if you like silly, sci-fi and in-jokes. 2 out of 10 if you dislike silliness, satire, slapstick and sci-fi..  \\\"Only and idiot would drive head-on into another car without first having a few drinks\\\"\", \"The wonderful thing about this film is that it stands up to repeated viewings by default - You really have to view it several times just to understand what the heck is going on. The payoff is not only getting a grip on the ultimate battle between the black lectroids (good guys) and the red lectroids (bad guys), but you are also treated to picking up on new gags and jokes (actually more like bits of humor - to wit: Who in their right mind would build a jet car out of an Econoline Van???) and subtle plot devices which were previously overlooked. One criticism that makes this a less than perfect movie (although I rated it a 10 because it's just so way out there) is the audio track, which seems to be mixed way too low on my copy of the video, making it a struggle to hear what's being said over background noise, music, and tape hiss. Maybe this is just another of the clever plot devices to keep you tuning in to the adventure. By the way - does anyone have an extra Oscillation Overthruster they can spare?  \\\"Laugh while you can, Monkey Boy!\\\"  I'm out.\", \"Since the release of this film in 1984, it has achieved bona fide cult status, and with good reason; for it is, without question, one of the most unique offerings in the universe of cinematic science fiction. chock-full of quirky, memorable characters and scenes, `The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension,' directed by W.D. Richter, is laced with clever dialogue, action, adventure and surprises. And where else are you ever going to find a main character who is a scientist, brain surgeon and rock n' roll star all rolled up into one?  \\tAfter years of research, Buckaroo Banzai (Peter Weller) and his colleague, Professor Hikita (Robert Ito), have successfully developed an `overthruster,' a device that has allowed Buckaroo to pass through solid matter-- a mountain, in fact-- driving through it at high speed in his specially designed and equipped car. But when his achievement hits the news, it captures the attention of the mad Dr. Emilio Lizardo (John Lithgow), who catches the story on television from his room in the insane asylum, where he has been a resident for many years, ever since his own attempt at developing an overthruster failed.   \\tBut though Lizardo's trial run with the overthruster failed, it did put him in contact with alien beings from another realm, one of whom-- Lord John Whorfin-- has since that encounter inhabited Lizardo's mind and body. They are Red Lectroids from Planet 10 by way of the 8th dimension, stranded on earth (in human form) and awaiting the development of the overthruster, which will enable them to return home. These are dangerous and resourceful beings, and they are about to take Buckaroo Banzai-- currently on tour with his band, The Hong Kong Cavaliers-- by surprise. And soon, all that will stand between the Red Lectroids and the destruction of the earth, will be Buckaroo, his band and some help from his loyal followers, the `Blue Blazer Regulars.'  \\tWorking from the highly imaginative, clever and detailed screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch, Richter has fashioned and delivered a colorful and exciting adventure filled with subtle humor, the unexpected and an array of outrageous characters, from Whorfin and the Lectroids (all of whom have the first name `John'), to Buckaroo's cohorts like `Perfect Tommy (Lewis Smith)' and New Jersey (Jeff Goldblum), to the alluring, mysterious woman Buckaroo encounters, Penny Priddy (Ellen Barkin). It's an unconventional, yet readily accessible film that Richter has packed with interesting asides, lines and situations, all of which drive the story forward and keep you guessing as to what could possibly happen next. He throws so much at you, in fact, that it's impossible to catch it all the first time through; but it's a movie that lends itself to repeated viewings, because it's exactly what this kind of film is supposed to be: Pure entertainment from start to finish.  \\tPeter Weller is perfectly cast as Buckaroo, and he successfully captures all of the elements that make his character the ultimate Renaissance Man of the immediate future. With this performance, Weller becomes the personification of the genius, adventurer and master-of-all-things; it's the definitive portrayal of a unique individual, quite unlike any ever presented on the silver screen before. Weller's Buckaroo is intelligent and self-assured-- watching him you get the feeling there's always something going on in his head, and always a step ahead of the next guy-- and it's his ability to convey the complexities of the character that makes him believable, and his incredible exploits seem credible. Simply put, Weller has taken a comic book character and made him real, and it makes the film work.  \\tAs Lizardo/Whorfin, John Lithgow takes it magnificently over the top with a character that is something of a precursor to his High Commander Dick Solomon on TV's `3rd Rock from the Sun.' And watching this guy in action is a real kick. He's larger than life, wildly animated and extroverted, while affecting an accent that's a veritable smorgasbord of dialect. He lumbers along like a mutated Quasimodo, and when he gives a speech to his fellow Red Lectroids about going `home,' it's one of the most hilarious scenes you're ever going to see anywhere. There's definitely a method to Lithgow's madness, and it's a terrific performance.  \\tChristopher Lloyd also turns in a winning performance as another of the Red Lectroids, `John Bigboote,' and his exchanges with Lithgow are a riot (especially when Lizardo insists on calling him `Big-Booty,' and Bigboote adamantly insists that it is pronounced `Bigboo-TAY!'). And that's just an example of the many, many finer and detailed elements Richter uses to make this film so enjoyable and successful, from consistently funny verbal exchanges to broad physical humor, all interspersed with the action and woven seamlessly into the story.  \\tThe additional supporting cast includes Rosalind Cash (John Emdall), Pepe Serna (Reno Nevada), Matt Clark (McKinley), Clancy Brown (Rawhide), Carl Lumbly (John Parker), Vincent Schiavelli (John O'Connor), Dan Hedaya (John Gomez), Bill Henderson (Casper), Damon Hines (Scooter), Billy Vera (Pinky Carruthers), Ronald Lacey (President Widmark) and William Traylor (General Catburd). A film that will take you on a wild ride and into regions beyond the known, `The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension' is that most rare treasure among cinematic discoveries: A truly unique film. It's enthralling and entertaining, and will keep you laughing and involved no matter how many times you see it. And it's filled with great lines you'll be able to quote endlessly and use for any occasion. Or, as Buckaroo himself would say, `No matter where you go, there you are...' It's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 9/10.\", \"I'm not surprised that many people do not 'get' this film. It is a very low-budget, 'psuedo-Sci-Fi' film. 'Psuedo', because it is most definitely not serious about being 'Sci-Fi'. All of the 'science' is portrayed totally tongue-firmly-in-cheek. If you didn't get that with the \\\"baby bang\\\" reference from \\\"Doctor\\\" Penny Priddy during the press conference scene, well, then I'm sorry, but you're hopeless.  If anything, this is an anti-Sci-Fi film. It's a spoof of all those 1950's-era Sci-Fi films where the incredibly bad science interpretation is played completely seriously. I mean, c'mon, the Overthruster tracking device with the UPS-truck turn-signal click should have clued you in that someone isn't quite serious here.  What we've got here is a great romp with some future mega-stars having a great time. Lithgow's performance alone is worth the price of admission. Ellen Barkin is luscious in both that pink dress and her tied-up black skirt. That jail-cell flirtation scene... well, what more can I say? Those wonderful in-jokes: \\\"Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems\\\". YOYO-dyne? \\\"The Future Begins Tomorrow\\\"... well, of course it does. \\\"Negative, we do not have crossover... we are over New Jersey. All is not lost.\\\" Well, of course it isn't... or is it? (Born and raised there, Woodbridge Twp., sorry. To this day, my sister and brother-in-law live in New Brunswick, I'm not making this up.) If you own the DVD, as I do, then you probably know that practically nothing was created for this film. The Red Lectroid bivouac was an abandoned Firestone tire factory. If you ever did high-school drama, you probably recognized Lizardo's foot-pedals as an ancient lighting dimmer board. The spinning Styrofoam cup in the \\\"shock tower\\\" (an automotive term) takes the cake.  There is so much going on in this low-low-budget film to laugh with, not at. If you watch this film looking not to trash it but to laugh with it, I think you will get far, far more out of it.  I only wish they had been able to make the sequel.  And finally, I originally saw this film when it was first released, in the Harvard Square cinema in Cambridge, Mass. The screening was sparsely attended, but you could tell that some people \\\"got it\\\" even then, and many didn't. Too bad.\", \"HOLY COW. I have only been around for 13 years now, and that was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I quote that movie almost everyday since I saw it, and hope to own it on video or DVD really really soon. Lines like, \\\"No matter where you go\\u0085 there you are.\\\" and \\\"Give her your jacket\\\" - Buckaroo \\\"Why me\\\" - Tommy Prefect \\\"Because, your Mr. Prefect.\\\" Buckaroo \\\"(pauses) You have a point there\\\" - Tommy, still crack me up. I would love to see the sequel the \\\"World Crime League\\\" but I guess some people don't have as good of humor as some of us. I guess it's to late to do that now, but man, It would have been one of my all time favorite movies. If your in for a good laugh, and can fine this rare treasure in some movie place, RENT IT, and if you like it, BUY IT.\", \"Aliens hiding on Earth, all with the first name of \\\"John\\\". A deranged mad scientist named Dr. Emilio Lizardo. A band of sidekicks named the Hong Kong Cavaliers. And in the center of it, Buckaroo Bonzai -- the part-time particle physicist, part-time brain surgeon, part-time rock'n'roller. How could this not be fun?  You're not watching this for the deep inner meaning. You're watching this because it's ridiculous and the actors know it is. John Lithgow is absolutely over the top as Lizardo. And Jeff Goldblum does a great comic turn as New Jersey.\", \"If you like The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy or Red Dwarf, chances are you'll enjoy Buckaroo Bonzai. It is full of subtle/dry humor and has an overall upbeat mood. The subtly dry humor is found in the background audio as well as the odds and ends that find their way into the set decor and dialog. These offer a nice array of silliness to punctuate the story with their own unique twists of humor.  The cast is definitely All Star! Peter Weller (Robocop), John Lithgow (Third Rock from the Sun), Robert Ito (Quincy MD), Clancy Brown (Highlander), Ellen Barkin (Wild Bill), and Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future) all have fun and amusing roles. Even the minor roles are covered well by perhaps lesser known yet veteran cast members such as Rosalind Cash and Matt Clark.  If you're a fan of British humor, you should definitely enjoy this one, even though it may take more than one viewing to catch all the subtleties. If you haven't been exposed to this style of humor, this certainly isn't a bad place to start! If, on the other hand, this style of humor is not what you enjoy, it may not be the one for you. For everyone else, kick back and enjoy! If it weren't a bit of a cult classic, I doubt it would be available on DVD. I give it a 7 out of 10 since it may not be for everyone. Personally, I rate it a notch higher.\", \"W.D Richter's Buckaroo Banzai succeeds on many levels, thanks to a wonderfully droll sensibility and inspired casting. Peter Weller lends a perfect, dead-pan seriousness to the very 'out there' proceedings, while John Lithgow chews up the scenery as the fiendish Dr. Lizardo. Ellen Barkin is particularly fetching as Penny Priddy, while Jeff Goldblum stakes out his turf with an engaging feverishness that is all his own. Christopher Lloyd takes a relatively low-key approach to his role and does well for it, allowing for Lithgow's extravagance. Welding the pieces together is a delirious, kinetic script by Earl M. Rauch.The film, although essentially a spoof of science fiction films and comic book superheroes, remains a delightful, inventive enigma of eighties cinema. The look of the picture is quite good, and (considering it's meager budget) highly-digestible. Given that the film never found a mass audience, it is surprising that so many individuals seem to remember it as vividly, and as fondly as they do. I can only hope that after everyone has gotten their fill of a certain \\\"galaxy far, far away\\\", that a return to the more substantial basics of storytelling and characterization is deemed imperative. Meanwhile sit back, relax, and laugh yourself silly with a charming, 'little' film that tends to be so much more.\", \"\\\"So what? Big deal.\\\"- A Lectroid commander in THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI.   Greetings honorary members of the Hong Kong Cavaliers and to all you neutral observers and detractors as well. Hoping to clarify the mystery and purpose of this 1984 docudrama, I have scoured all available data (including movie reviews), scrutinized the musings of the film's director via the DVD's special features, and held extensive conferences with official representatives of the Banzai Institute for Biomedical Engineering and Strategic Information. I hasten to point out that my findings are inconclusive and that many questions remain.   The film is (negatively) a rambling, disjointed pastiche of pseudo-hip, sci-fi/comic book inspired shenanigans that (positively) manages to generate inordinate amounts of charm and wonder through its fortuitous collusion of eccentric story line (battling aliens; a deeply depressed damsel-in-distress, Penny Priddy; the actual Hong Kong Cavaliers honing their rock and roll chops; Buckaroo himself, pushing his new jet car- with the incredible Oscillation Overthruster -through the forbidding regions of the 8th dimension) and the glowing charisma of the actors at play: John Lithgow's Dr. Lizardo is hilarious and ingenious. W.D. Richter's nerdy persona obscures his inability to fashion Earl Mac Rauch's free-wheeling screenplay into a coherent whole. Still, the many facets of the story remain intriguing and Michael Boddicker's synthesized music is majestic and buoyant.   However, the questions persist. What did happen at Grover's Mill in October of 1938? Was Orson Welles part of an invasion plot that involved mass hypnosis? Are there extraterrestrial biological entities living among us? Documentation outlining an thorough governmental inquiry into these matters has reached this commentator. A report by the investigators, special agents Mulder and Scully, shall be made available to the public in due course. A final note: a page, supposedly torn from Welles' personal diary and written in a shaky, nearly illegible hand, carried the following, ominous message: keep watching the skies!\", \"This is the most bizarre movie I've ever seen - and it is one of my absolute favorites.

The whole thing was a bit stupid and sometimes it felt like watching paint dry. I am not a massive Coen fan so this film did not appeal to me as it did to many other people.

I didn't actually realise this film was a comedy until afterwards so it obviously wasn't very funny.

It had the best cinematography and an edgy feel to it with two wild characters - Catwomen and The Penguin - along with the always-interesting Christopher Walken. However, after the last viewing it finally slipped in my ratings and, frankly, I now prefer the last Batman: Batman Begins, with Christian Bale.  THE GOOD - Nonetheless, this is still the most intriguing of the five latter-day Batman films. The stylish cinematography in here is the best of any of the Batman movies. Director Tim Burton is known for his films which feature stunning visuals, as this is a great example. The three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. Of the villains, I preferred Catwomen, finding her the most fun to watch before and after she changed. Violence is not overdone here as it was in several of the other Batman stories but one is never bored watching this. As he did in the first film, Michael Keaton does a fine job playing Batman/Bruce Wayne.  THE BAD - For a movie based on a comic strip that mostly kids read, I still think these first two Batman movies, both done by Burton, were too dark and the profanity was definitely not appropriate. Although, unlike the first movie, there was no usage of the Lord's name in vain in here, there still was profanity and both villains made too many sexual remarks. That would have been okay if they hadn't marketed this film for kids as well as adults. Danny DeVito's \\\"Penguin\\\" is downright gross in spots. \\\"Grotesque\\\" I can handle, but who wants \\\"gross.\\\" Few guys, meanwhile, complained about the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer playing Catwoman. Generall too much darkness and some cheap shots on Christian- bashing also made me re-consider my previously-high rating of this film.  OVERALL - Fabulous visuals and memorable characters make this the most interesting in the Batman series, but too-dark an edge, too gross and too much anti-religious bias all finally turned me off after a half-dozen looks at this film. Sorry, but I prefer a kinder-gentler Batman movie. After all, it's just a cartoon. Most will disagree, but I was glad to see the series lighten up after this one.\", \"With \\\"Batman Returns\\\", Tim Burton succumbed to an important priority in American cinema: giving a sequel to a blockbuster. Three years after the most successful movie of the year, \\\"Batman\\\" (1989), here comes the hero of Gotham City again for the pleasure of many spectators. Like its predecessor, \\\"Batman Returns\\\" enjoyed an enormous commercial success. Tim Burton made Batman come back once again because it is to believe that the victory of the latter on his enemy the Joker did little to improve the image of Gotham City. Indeed, violence and corruption still exist and here, the second word is epitomized by Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the penguin (Danny De Vito). These two crooks who are eager to take control of Gotham City are going to make life difficult for Batman. His task will be more difficult with the apparition of Catwoman...   Tim Burton still delivered much work on the scenery and it seems that he tried to correct the faults of the first movie. It means that the director gave way to fight sequences which are better mastered than in the first Batman. But he didn't neglect the psychology of his main characters for all that. If in the movie of 1989, Burton had focused on Bruce Wayne/Batman's psychology, here, it's the penguin that obviously interested him. The director attempted to make of him, very well acted by De Vito an ambiguous character. On one hand, he's full of bad intentions (previously quoted) but on the other hand, he's searching for his past and would like to be considered as a real man.  \\\"Batman Returns\\\" also appears as crazier than its predecessor, especially with the cast. I think of Mich\\u00e8le Pfeiffer who offers a daring and powerful performance as Catwoman. Besides, at the time when I'm writing this review, it makes me remember that a new version of Catwoman is currently at the cinema. But given the bad reviews (3 out of 10 on IMDb!), it is sure that her performer Halle Berry must pale into insignificance beside Pfeiffer.  Ultimately, this film is one of the best sequels of 1992 and it enables to develop Tim Burton's peculiar style. We also still find his taste for the strange and the Gothic. Concerning Batman's other adaptations for the screen, you can skip them. \\\"Batman Forever\\\" (1995) and \\\"Batman and Robin\\\" (1997) are no good. I heard that Christopher Nolan was shooting the beginning of the Batman story and it was to be released next year. Will it match Tim Burton's works?\", \"This film is where the Batman franchise ought to have stopped. Though I will concede that the ideas behind \\\"Batman Forever\\\" were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case.  Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second Batman film from Tim Burton turned out. Apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the Sixties TV series, I fail to understand how \\\"Batman Returns\\\" can be considered at all disappointing.  True, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in \\\"Batman,\\\" a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the Batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying.  Michael Keaton returns as the Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, tangling with nouveau riche tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honour of the 1920s German silent actor), his partner-in-crime Oswald Cobblepot, the Penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's \\\"Richard III\\\"), and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom Wayne romances both as himself and as the Batman. The four principals turn in excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while together Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities.  There are some intriguing concepts in this film. About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places, which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. There simply isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on.  Nevertheless, this is a damn good film. I highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under Burton and Keaton.\", \"Any Batman fan will know just how great the films are, they've been a major success. Batman Returns however is by far the best film in the series. A combination of excellent directing, brilliant acting and settings makes this worthy of watching on a night in.  Tim Burton, who directed this movie, has specifically made sure that this film gives a realistic atmosphere and he's done a great job. Danny Devito (Penguin man) is a man who has inherited penguin characteristics as a baby, and grown up to become a hideous and ugly...thing! Michelle Pfiffer plays the sleek and very seducing 'Catwoman' after cats had given her there genes from being bitten. The result in both the character changes is excellent and both Catwoman and Penguin man play a very important role in this excellent film. The mysterious Catwoman is great fun to watch - her classic sayings and a funny part in which skips with her whip in a jewelry shop adds such fun to the film. Danny Devito also does well, his ability to impersonate some strange creature was vital, and he adds a great atmosphere to the film that takes us back to the dull sewers where he lives.  You can't forget Batman though. Micheal Keaton once again pulls of a comfortable performance, and shows us a different side to Batman. His affection is let loose when he confronts Catwoman at the end of the film, and his meetings with her when she's a normal person, Selina Kyle, result in him being seduced badly in his own home. There's a clever part after this when they leave, and the film is full of great scenes. Its worth noting that Bruce Wayne's Bat mobile is not used as much as in the other Batman films, as close combat and story telling scenes make up this film.  The winter setting is created perfectly in Gotham City with most of the scenes being set at night, and with the town being filled with snow. Therefore, if you watch this film during the summer like I have, it doesn't feel the same. Best watch it during the winter.  Overall, its an amazing movie. All the credit goes to Tom Burton and the cast, they've done an incredible job.\", \"Batman Returns is more Gothic and somber than its predecessor, and I like it a lot. Also, the scenery is more darker, and the entire environment is saddening along with the soul-chilling music composed by the so-talented Danny Elfman.  However, I didn't like the idea to make the Penguin a monster, unlike to the comic books, where he's human. Even if he looks like a monster, he shows well that he possesses a human dignity, and I felt very sorry for him when he saw the tombstones of his late parents. But still, he was a dangerous villain in fact, and he needed to be stopped.  Michael Keaton made a \\\"tour de force\\\" with his return as the Dark Knight, and this time he's powerful as in the original Batman. It's not difficult to understand why he's called Batman in public sometimes...  Also, Michelle Pfeiffer is so sexy and well-fitted in her role, and she gave a faithfully performance as the female villain/crimefighter dressed as a cat. Really, the actors did all a masterful work with Batman Returns, which made it a successful movie.  If you liked Batman, watch its awesome sequel, cause it's very worthy for all the Dark Knight's hard-core lovers.  Steve Baillargeon\", \"Tim Burton is in essence an expressionist film-maker, disinterested in dimensions of character and obsessed with Gothic scope, opting for style over substance incessantly throughout his career. However, with his style being so poignantly endearing, I, like many moviegoers, forgive all the countless flaws that can be found in many of his movies and become engrossed in what are essentially, one hundred million dollar art films.  It's almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic, emotionally involving spirit within the second installment of a mediocre franchise, especially when that franchises target audience are half-witted 15 year old boys. Batman Returns should have been every bit as commercial as its predecessor, ensuring box office draw and cheap (in actual fact, very expensive) thrills, being entertaining without ever truly involving its audience. Had this been the result, then Tim Burton would have surely been required to direct a third installment. Instead, Burton delivers something that can only truly be defined by the phrase, 'out there'.  From the melancholy opening in which a high society couple throw a prison-like bassinette containing their newly born deformed baby into a river, it is clear that Batman Returns, ain't no picnic at Buckingham Palace. Cut to thirty three years later, during a political speech made by bad guy business tycoon Max Shreck (sinisterly portrayed by Christopher Walken), the Red Triangle Circus Gang attack Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton returning to the role) makes his first appearance sporting a new logo, eventually saving the day. Shreck is soon kidnapped by the circus gang and black-mailed into endorsing the political return of the baby, now a fully grown Penguin man (Danny DeVito in hideously perfect make-up), whose motives for return are suspicious only to Batman.  Meanwhile, Shreck attempts to off his nosey and awkward assistant Selina Kyle (played perfectly by Michelle Pfeiffer who quite frankly deserved more recognition for her performance) who transforms into the deliciously sexy and psychotic Catwoman, out for revenge and harbours, for some unexplained reason, a deadly vendetta against the Dark Knight.  Batman Returns is bleak. The production design is breathtaking, delivering a cold haunting Gotham City with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor. Danny Elfman's score supports the film brilliantly, ranging from invigorating to tragic. The tone and direction of the whole film itself is intensely brooding, shot like a sad nightmare, Burton's direction overshadows what is in fairness a diabolical screenplay with an almost totally irrelevant plot and yet at the same time perfect for Burton's visual style of film-making. And whilst Burton's action sequences struggle for exhilaration, the real excitement lies in the directional choices displaying the fall of each of its main characters, the Penguins demise, the Catwoman's mental state and Bruce Wayne's lonely destiny.  Warner Brothers hated it whilst critical and audience reaction was mixed. After all, they wanted a Batman sequel, not a weird, somewhat ghastly horror movie, in which a deformed psychopathic orphan attempts to kidnap and drown a batch of babies, all-the-while vomiting what can only be described as green mucus. The production company wanted an audience friendly feature, something for the McDonald's clan to promote their happy meals with, not a movie of dire irredeemable characters, including a sexually repressed secretary who is pushed from a skyscraper and revived by a gang of cats awakening her from unconsciousness by chewing on her bloodied ice cold fingers.  It's easy to understand the mass disappointment that followed the release of Batman Returns. The film never felt like a Batman blockbuster. It is questionable if Burton really knew who Batman actually was or even if he cared about the character as much as he cared about the film fitting in with his usual themes of beautifully haunting art direction and misinterpreted, lonely characters who rarely conform with societies standards and expectations. This is why Burton failed to create a great Batman film. He did however; create a nostalgic and stunning, ballsy piece of cinema that remains a personal and nostalgic favourite of mine.  This may not be a great Batman movie. But it is a great Tim Burton film.\", \"what can i say, this film is amazing. it has its flaws like every film does for example wobbly headstones in a graveyard, a clearly visible slide board during the penguins death scene, Max Shreck losing his heavy coat in a split second between shots during the image consultancy scene, batman losing his black eye makeup all of a sudden between shots so he can reveal Bruce Wayne to Catwoman, dialogue being recorded but is played back and spoken differently than when it was spoken in the first place and lastly Catwoman all of a sudden knows how to use a bull whip without any training whatsoever. these flaws are minor compared to some you would see in for example batman forever where the riddler can obviously be seen waiting for his cue or val Kilmer's hair changing between shots.  what makes this film so deserving of an 8/10 is the great acting because the performances are absolutely amazing. Michael Keaton reprises his role as Batman and has a lot more to do in this film. He looks more comfortable in the role the second time around and is on par with the villains performances. Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. I really like the conversion of the penguin into the grotesque penguin man instead of the non threatening character from the comics or TV show because now the character has more depth and has a far more interesting story that generates from the basic need of family and to feel accepted and wanted. this gives us an evil character who we feel sympathy for because he was rejected for being what he is which is not his fault. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman. she is sleet and sexy and she is also a villain we can feel sorry for because of the way she is victimised. Christopher Walken is a great secondary villain and is so interesting a character even though he is not even in the batman universe.  the soundtrack is far better than the first and Danny Elfman gets more of a chance to show off his musical talents this time around. The sets are amazing. They are detailed, eye catching, sinister, Gothic , unique, dark and so many other adjectives can describe how amazing they look. the costumes and make up are great and obviously a lot of work went into making them and all the work pays off because the Batsuit is better, the cat suit is amazing to look at and the penguin make up and effects are so convincing.The animatronic penguins look really realistic and are played to good effect. The script is really good and the Storyline in my opinion is a plausible one. overall, because of all these factors this film deserves an 8/10 and stands as my favourite of all the batman films\", \"The best Batman movie of the 90's no doubt about it. This movie takes place in a city filled with insecurity and nightmares.  Although the villains are somewhat cheesy, they fit perfect for the movie's tone of colorful but nightmarish cinematography.   The performances are really great and the comic tone behind them really delivers expectations.   Don't get fooled by the cheesy outfits, this is a movie in the pure style of Burton. That can't be described; Burton is a sui generis director that took the Batman franchise to another obscure level but not forgetting about it's comic style past.   Recommended for fans of action cinema and best of all, if it deals with super heroes.\", \"First off, this film has no story. It's obvious there were a lot of rewrites during production -- sometimes characters reference a timeline that is impossible, and this is probably because the timeline of the entire story was never known to anyone on the set.  That said, the film is kinda brilliant. Pfeiffer is amazing -- and I mean amazing, as Catwoman; she nails the character's inherent sexy darkness and good/bad tendencies. Walken is Walken -- but even more nasty than usual. Devito is not true to the comic book when it comes to Penguin, but he is good and memorable.   Keaton is underrated as Batman.   And the music and style are pure cinema thrill. True, the 3rd act doesn't work. But the final 2 scenes are knockouts, and it's clear Pfeiffer and Keaton were meant to be in a trilogy that got derailed by this film's kinky darkness. That's too bad, because Pfieffer and Keaton had classic chemistry, and had they acted in a third installment, Joel you know who might not have gotten the chance to destroy Batman for an entire generation of movie fans.\", \"When I first rented Batman Returns, I immediately thought it was going to be less than exceptional. I mean, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without him, how could there be a good movie? Simple, throw in Danny DeVito.  Batman Returns is an arguably more dark movie than Batman. There are more villains here, less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects, and more nerve-striking issues. However, the music is similar to the first if not darker. The scenery is definitely more depressing than the first, every detail right down to the time of year. This movie follows the same comic-style format we came to love in the first Batman.  Now for the performances. Michael Keaton thankfully returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He was great in the first movie, and just as much in this sequel. There was not enough screen time in the world for Keaton as Batman, need MORE! Danny DeVito gave an award-winning performance as The Penguin, the most grueling, disgusting, lovable, angry, evil, sad, pathetic villain ever to grace a superhero movie. You hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time. And it explains him down to the last detail too, making it all the more conflicting. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman/Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. She actually got a good amount of back story as well. Christopher Walken didn't disappoint as Max Shreck, the greedy, judgmental, selfish CEO of the power company. Michael Gough also thankfully returns as the lovable Alfred, and he was just as good here as well. Pat Hingle also returns as Gordon, although I feel he was really never in the spotlight.  With lots of great twists and sub-plots, Batman Returns is sure to please any fan of the original.  9/10\", \"Batman Returns It is my opinion that the first Batman of the Batman series was only half the movie that Batman Returns is. In the first Batman by Tim Burton we had only Batman and The Joker both played wonderfully by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson.  In Batman Returns we have what I feel is the most perfectly cast Batman movie (yes even better then Dark Knight). Keaton returns as Batman and is perfect in the role never going to far over top with the character of Batman, which is perfect in this film when it comes to the two villains that he's up against. First you have Danny DeVito who is delightfully insane as the Penguin. Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat-Woman, who I dare to say is one of the most interesting and complex villains in the Batman movies. I feel this way about Pfeiffer because of the way she becomes the Cat-Woman she starts off as the rather pathetic mousy Selena Kyle and then truly dives into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant performance of a woman who goes from trying to be a hero to a villain and then I suppose back to a hero in the end. Also in this amazing cast you have the evil businessman Max Schreck played by the amazing and legendary Christopher Walken. While in a supporting role there's something about this role that I love and maybe it's the look of Schreck in the film that makes his performance all the better then it already is.  Story wise I have to say that Batman Returns has so much more going on this time around as opposed to the first Batman. Part of the reason I loved this story so much is the fact that Burton dared to go in a much more darker and twisted direction as opposed to Nicholson's over the top antics. You have the story on the Penguin and how he tries to deceive the people of Gotham into making him the new hero and mayor of the city. Then you have Cat-Woman and her struggle to decide just who she really is and what she should do with her new persona. When it comes to Batman I feel that in this one he's more the ring leader that holds the two stories together but of course kicking ass at the same time.  Cinematography was the film is dark and atmospheric just like the story that's taking place within it. Gotham City never looked as good as it does on Blu-Ray and HD so if you have the chance to see it this way then by all means do because it truly adds to the overall experience of Batman Returns.  So all in I truly feel that of all the Batman movies Batman Returns believe it or not tops the Dark Knight for me because while I enjoyed that movie for Heath Ledger's amazing performance as the Joker I felt that the movie was lacking something. Batman Returns lacks nothing, so if you want to see an amazing film with what I feel is a perfect cast then this is the Batman to light the Bat signal for.\", \"As a kid I grew up with the chintzy 60's TV series (and no I'm not that old\\u0085 POW!). However when director Tim Burton brought his novel vision to the silver screen, I simply took an immediate shine to it and never backed away from favoring his installments over the much hyped-latest additions ('Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'), which I don't really care for. Even if they're going for a much more grounded approach and wanting to explore Bruce Wayne/Batman psyche further\\u0085 but in honesty I don't think there's all that much to tap in to. I wanted crazy fun with a dark streak and in my eyes that's what Burton brought across, and this is the reason why I can watch them over and over again.   After wowing audiences with the 1989 'Batman', thanks to the gaudily Gothic art direction and Jack Nicholson take no-prisoners performance of the camped-up, but psychotic Joker. Burton would return 3 years later for the follow up and my favorite of the batman films so far; 'Batman Returns'. Camp, but well-done. In what would fair up to being even more expansive, louder, dreary, and nihilistic and having two villainous foes for the price of one. Enter the grotesque Penguin (with Danny DeVito magnificently going out on a limb) and the ravishing Catwoman (a steamy Michelle Pfeiffer who fills out the suit nicely) coming to spoil Gotham's party. Again Batman (an aptly brooding Michael Keaton is equally commendable and looks quite imposing in that bat suit\\u0085 look at the eyes) plays second fiddle to the bad guys, but I always preferred this sober interpretation of Batman that gave him an ominously gloomy mystique, but also a wearing psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed. And his turn of Bruce Wayne was well served too. Burton's illustratively atmospheric direction opens with his sleek Gothic style engraving an carnival comic book world filtered in with a splendid range of characters and vivid costumes. The moody narrative (in what probably is a tad too long) is more so symbolic in its progression, rather show-piecing its spontaneously arresting and extravagant set-pieces and sharply etched art direction covered with shadowy tinges and grey/blue neon lighting of a wintry backdrop. The magnetically free-flowing camera-work takes flight and Danny Elfman's stately spacious score balances the playfulness along with gloomy touches with a very hypnotic pull. The rest of the performances might be overshadowed, but Christopher Walken digs in his teeth into a smarmily glassy role of a two-faced businessman Max Shreck. Pat Hingle is back, but gets very little to do as Commissioner James Gordon and Michael Gough is delightful as Alfred. In solid support are Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryniarski, Vincent Schiavelli, Doug Jones and Peter Rubens also makes a cameo appearance.\", \"I remember really liking BATMAN RETURNS when it came out in 1992, but now I think that this is the best of all the Batman movies (even over Christopher Nolan's terrific 2005 BATMAN BEGINS and definitely over the seriously over-hyped overrated 2008 THE DARK KNIGHT!). I originally remember thinking that the 1st BATMAN w/ Jack Nicholson was the best (and I still love it). But I think that this movie really hits the nail on the head. The 4 main characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman, and Max Shreck) are all vivid and memorable. You really get to see what Batman/Bruce Wayne is all about in Keaton's terrific characterization. Keaton is the best Batman, not Kilmer, Clooney, or even the up-and-coming Bale, who was exceptional in BB and could have stolen top honors from Keaton had his character not been destroyed by Nolan's hack film-making in TDK !.   Danny DeVito as The Penguin is disturbing, scary, hilarious, and lethal. DeVito is great and doesn't need scenery-chewing to give great performance like Nicholson's Joker. The viewer can actually sympathize with this disfigured outcast and his plight to fit into normal society. I had never really been big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer until this film, but this is definitely my favorite performance of hers. Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle is goofy and odd at first, then when she is transformed into Catwoman, she is simultaneously sexy and scary, a total deadly sexpot! Also, I feel that Keaton and Pfeiffer have more chemistry than Keaton and Basinger from BATMAN; they form a tragic love story. And Christopher Walken as Shreck is, well, as always, Christopher Walken!  BATMAN RETURNS, more so than BATMAN, is more confident and focused. It is assured film-making from beginning to end. The way Burton introduces the Penguin's heartbreaking backstory grabs you from the very beginning. The first 5 minutes are among my favorite beginnings to any film: Danny Elfman's music sets an ominous foreboding tone that defines the rest of the film. It is a modification from the original BATMAN and a great one!  Then flash forward 33 years to the present day Gotham and we are introduced to powerful businessman Shreck who wants to build new power plant in Gotham. During same scene we meet Shreck's meek, bullied, under-confident secretary Selina Kyle. And not long after all this is the film's exciting opening action sequence as Batman must battle The Penguin's Red Triangle Gang, a fun yet lethal group of outcasts and circus performers. Penguin sets plan in motion to attack the Gotham Christmas celebration, kidnap Shreck in the chaos, and force him to help re-introduce him to society. Meanwhile, Selina discovers Shreck's criminal plans and so he \\\"kills\\\" her by shoving her out his high-rise office, then she is revived by cats.   Sound convoluted? Yes, but Burton never claimed to be posing a realistic story. He has created a world where the viewer can accept that things like this can happen, a dark, noirish world comprised of mistreated, deformed outcasts who deep down only want acceptance and to fit in. Confident storytelling if you ask me!  The action scenes are few and far in between, but they are all exciting, entertaining, and nail-biting. They aren't there just for show, the way some in BATMAN are. And they all make sense. The climactic scene with Penguin's \\\"army\\\" marching into the center of Gotham with Batman zoning in on Penguin's hideout and sidekick butler Alfred (Michael Gough in a welcome return from the original!) assisting Batman is succinct, solid, heart-pounding fun!  I also love the Christmastime, wintry setting, which adds to the super-dark, cold feel of Burton's Batman world. I also love the way Burton slowly introduces to us the Batman \\\"toys\\\" without shoving them down our throats. Each \\\"toy\\\" is appropriate for that moment in the film and we are compelled to accept them for their purpose. And although dark, RETURNS is still a funny film. DeVito's Penguin has many funny lines. So does Walken's Shreck. The Batman-Catwoman exchanges are extremely stimulating and humor-filled as well! A great ensemble! All in all, BATMAN RETURNS is a tightly woven tale of the dark forces at play in Tim Burton's fun, comic book world.\", \"1992's \\\"Batman Returns\\\" was Tim Burton's second round as director and yet again he scored a hit by making this film again dark and gloomy like his 1989 one. Gotham City again is a place of darkness and gloom with crime and corruption boiling out from every street corner. It was also clever to see how Burton used politics as a subplot that tied in well and neat with the business corruption of businessman Max Shreck(Christopher Walken)and the plan to make the \\\"Penguin\\\"(Danny DeVito) mayor of Gotham! Anyway Keaton again returns as \\\"Batman\\\"/Bruce Wayne and he gives another stellar performance as a strange and torn man who just can't find love in a normal world yet he is challenged when he meets another lonely soul in Selina Kyle only Ms. Kyle has a dark secret of her own one that's very slinky and she's just a downright vamp as the sexy and mysterious yet dangerous \\\"Catwoman\\\"(Michelle Pfeiffer). A plan forms between both villains to destroy Gotham and most of all both want to rid themselves of the bat. Really this film even though violent and somewhat gross with many penguin scenes is clearly an exciting thrill ride from start to finish as you never find a dull moment and thumbs up to Tim again for his exploring of the characters as dark and conflicted it just made the film even more interesting. The performance from Michelle Pfeiffer was the best ever as no one could have played \\\"The Catwoman\\\" any better and Devito was perfect as the \\\"Penguin\\\" his body frame fit the character just perfect his performance even though ghoulish was fun to watch. \\\"Batman Returns\\\" is an entertaining thrill ride that you can't take your eyes off of as a viewer you will enjoy it many times it's that thrilling and explosive.\", \"I've enjoyed this movie ever since I was a kid and I still do. I also liked Batman forever back then but the real difference is that THIS movie didn't date when I grew up. I did notice a few scenes in this film that didn't make any sense like: 'Hhmm... the crowd is angry. Hey! Where did they get those tomatoes from?' Then I thought: 'who cares? This movie is not 100% serious anyway!'  The original Tim Burton Batman was great as well but it was a bit cheesy at some parts and I didn't like all the actors. This movie improved on almost every aspect with a wonderful cast, a more Gothic style and no involvement of Prince.   Nowadays, many fans of the Christopher Nolan movies dislike Burton claiming that the Nolan movies are more serious and therefore more loyal to the comics. I don't think this is entirely true: -There has never been an adaptation of the original concept of Batman which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun. -Batman has taken many forms over the years peeking its silliness in the 60's (and a bit with Batman & Robin). A director is free to choose what kind of Batman he's going to portray as long if it's good.  My opinion: Batman doesn't necessarily have to be serious. It's about a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears. Burton managed to create a perfect balance between the silliness and the darkness surrounding the whole idea.  I just recently watched the Nolan movies and I love those ones as well (especially The Dark Knight). There's simply something about this movie that interests me more. Nolan's goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so, he looked for an explanation of nearly every aspect of Batman. That's a bit too much for me, I'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of Batman. The Burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere.  My conclusion is that you shouldn't compare the Nolan with the Burton movies. They're just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like better. My respect is for both directors.\", \"I always thought the Batman Returns was a great sequel to Batman. The story was an interesting one and Danny Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton gave great performances. Plus lets face it, Tim Burton was a genius and did the comic book character more justice than Joel Screwmacher ever did.  Plot: Oswald Cobblepot also know as The Penguin(played By Danny Devito) is abandoned by his parents as child for being deformed. He uses this as an excuse to masquerade a sinister plot to abduct the first born children of Gotham with the help of his goons(Red Triangle Gang) and a very shady tycoon Max Shreck(played by Christopher Walken). Max Shreck later makes Penguin the mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle(Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed out of a window by Max Shreck and is revived by cats. Later on she develops cat-like qualities and seeks to destroy Max Shreck and Batman. Her reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained.  Opinion: Batman Returns is a classic. It has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere. Tim Burton always had a knack for making grim backgrounds look appealing. Micheal Keaton is still sharp as Batman. Danny Devito steals the show as Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin. When you think about it, he would have made a better Violator for the movie Spawn than John Leguizamo. Michelle Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry ever could. Max Shreck is one of Christopher Walken's best roles. The main reason why I like Batman Returns is that its fun. Its not only creative but its also fun. Something a lot of big budget movies these days sorely lack. The Batman series goes to the dogs after Tim Burton decided to do no more. You don't believe me, look at Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Thank god that Christopher Nolan breathed life back into the series with Batman Begins.\", \"Why is it better? Because it's true to the dark vision of the comic. Because the imagery is inventive and, unlike the first, there are real moments of fear and pathos in this one. The first one had too much of Jack Nicholson's shtick, too much Prince music, and an awkward \\\"romance.\\\" Here, instead of one villain, there are three. No Robert Wuhl, and the leading lady is more than just a pretty face. In fact, Pfeiffer is the #1 attraction of this film. Her transformation is what drives the running theme, teetering on the edge of sanity and insanity, good and evil. She becomes truly fearsome. The costumes and makeup are excellent. Danny DeVito's Penguin is inspired and anguished, not just a nut. His circus gang posse is the one element of comic relief (besides that giant duck). Max Shrek is the only character I'd have toned down, Walken is pretty hammy as the ruthless businessman. Danny Elfman's score is a perfect fit as usual, and the Siouxie and the Banshees song (\\\"Face to Face\\\") is easily the best of any of the songs from any of the films, a perfect match of musical artist and film soundtrack. The least campy of the films, it is macabre, doesn't pander, and demands second and third viewings like an amusement park ride. Bravo Tim Burton and cast!\", \"forget the over-rated \\\"Batman Begins, THIS is the ultimate Batman movie that you are not gonna want to miss out on. this movie has everything, and it totally surpasses the first 1989 mega hit. it may not have done as well as the first one in at the box office, but this is certainly a much better film. the visuals are amazing, Burton works his magic as he always does in his films once again. Gotham city, Batmans hunting ground, is an amazing sight to behold. the story itself is actually quite good and the 2 villains in this one are VERY interesting, much more interesting in fact then there comic book counterparts. Tim Burton and screenplay writer Daniel Walters go a step further to bring you a truly emotional connection with these characters. the Penguin, played to perfection by Danny Devito, is a type of tragic character who was abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge on the world that denied him. very disgusting to watch at times, but he has some of the most classic lines a villain could ever utter in a single film. the other villain is Catwoman, played so absolutely brilliantly by Michelle Pfieffer, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and gives a WOW performance, and totally steals the show as far any of the past and present live action batman villain's is concerned. she also has a tragic background. her name is Selina kyle, and she is a very put-upon, mousy secretary for a shrewd business man called Max Shreck, who later murders her by shoving her out a window. somehow, she survives and is \\\"awakened\\\" by cats, and decides right then and there to become the legendary Catwoman, not before, of course, the amazing sequence in which she completely lets loose and wrecks her entire apartment in one of the most Oscar worthy performance's of rage and anger i have ever seen in an actress.  Michael Keaton once again dons the cape and cowl as Batman and also as Bruce Wayne and THIS time hes much darker. there's not much else to say here except that Keaton is simply the best actor to play Batman ever. he just oozes cool, and he has a kind of Clint Eastwood approach to playing Batman, and he is very dark. he doesn't talk a lot, and when he does, he sounds very cool and he doesn't make his voice sound all goofy and fake IE bales \\\"batman\\\" voice in batman begins. he struts around Gotham like a man possessed by his own inner demons. he's pshycologically disturbed, and you know it. in this outing he takes on 2 of the most famous baddies to ever grace the batman comic book world.  i have to say though, despite the awesomeness of the action scenes, like the scenes with the coolest Batmobile EVER racing down the street knocking thugs to the ground and batman gliding across Gotham, its the romantic angle between Pfieffer and Keaton that really makes this movie classic a top choice for anyone who wants to see the REAL Batman in action, i rate this a 10, would give it more if i could.\", \"So what is 'Batman Returns', anyway?  It was marketed as an action film, and many people who've seen it seem to think that they've watched an action film - but really, there isn't that much action, and Tim Burton barely seems interested in it.  People often align it with the 'grittier' superhero comics of the late eighties, but honestly, if you've read 'The Dark Knight Returns', that seems just a little absurd; Burton's excessive imaginings have more in common with the day-glo sixties TV series (the Penguin drives around in a giant plastic duck, for goodness' sake).  Burton's style is often described as Gothic, and that's a little closer to what we see on screen; the Penguin - deformed, malign, with a tangled history and a subterranean lair - is a Gothic menace dressed up in more respectable Dickensian clothes - Udolfo masquerading as Uriah Heep.   But what of Catwoman? She may be raised from the dead, but that PVC catsuit is decidedly Twentieth Century, and her alter ego Selina Kyle's world is all boardrooms and apartments - reminiscent of a 1930s romantic comedy.  And then it clicks. The smart but downtrodden secretary romanced by a lonely millionaire? The ensuing complications caused by deception and disguise? 'Batman Returns' is, quite clearly, a romantic comedy in the old Hollywood style, filtered through Burton's S&M dungeon sensibilities. It has more in common with 'The Hudsucker Proxy' (including expressionist sets) than it does with other superhero films.   Like many a romantic comedy, it centres around the make-over of the heroine; not from ugly duckling to swan, but from doormat to dominatrix. Michelle Pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her (often remarkable) career; she's iconically sexy as Catwoman (poor Halle Berry never had a prayer), playful and vindictive, memorable because she knows how to act with her whole body. In retrospect, though, it's her scenes as Selina that impress; almost every one of them is a little comic gem, particularly the glimpse we get of her lonely home life. It's a delicately balanced tragicomic performance, and it's in these scenes that the film really sparks to life. Nothing moves me quite like Selina and Bruce Wayne dancing under the mistletoe to Siouxsie and the Banshees, a gun held between them, simultaneously empowered and trapped by their alter egos, doomed to conflict. Forget the easy sentimentality of 'Big Fish' or the gossamer emotions of 'Edward Scissorhands' - this is the most heartfelt scene in all of Burton's films. Love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, insanity, self-loathing and not a little wit, all in a few short lines and absolutely nailed by the actors - particularly Pfeiffer.   Elsewhere, Danny de Vito almost matches her, finding the wounded dignity buried beneath those truly repellent long-johns. The upper-crust villain of the comics is revealed to be nothing more than a sham; Burton's Penguin is a feral creature subjected to his own, Eliza Doolittle-style make-over (almost literally an 'ugly duckling'). It's Burton's most radical - and funniest - reinvention. Christopher Walken's Max Schreck completes a perfect triptych of villains, sliding between casual charm and blank-eyed psychosis with unnerving ease (and is it just me, or does his company's logo bring to mind Mickey Mouse? Perhaps we should ask former Disney animator Burton).  Christopher Nolan's 'Batman Begins' - a real action film - has been much praised as the first film to do justice to Batman; I admire Nolan's film, but it would be a pity if it were allowed to overshadow this idiosyncratic gem.\", \"This sequel proves that Tim Burton was for all intents and purposes THE best choice to ever direct a Batman movie. The story focuses on Baman taking on three enemies: The Penguin (wonderfully played by Danny DeVito) Catwoman (the slinky Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (the superb Christopher Walken).  Perhaps the best entry in the series, it has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out. The cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand-out is DeVito as the multi-layered Penguin. Here is a guy who is evil, pitiable, funny and perhaps most importantly, scary. The infamous scene with Shreck's image consultants still sends shivers up my spine. In other words, the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances.  I do not hesitate to say that \\\"Batman Returns\\\" is my favorite of all the Batmans released (sorry, Dark Knight fans). If you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action, then please check out this badly underrated film.   If nothing else, it's at least the best film Tim Burton has ever made.\", \"Batman Returns is to be considered quality when one speaks of superhero films. Its predecessor, Batman, in my opinion, is by far the greatest and most well thought out of the comic book genre. For one to say that Batman Returns was disappointing, he or she has not fully watched the movie and considered the acting of Danny Devito as the Penguin. Devito and Walken offer some memorable moments. The tale of Batman is suppose to be dark and Tim Burton has fulfilled how the comic portrays Batman. Batman Returns provides comic relief, action, suspense and fantasy; and it should not be viewed as 'crap', although we are all entitled to our own opinions.\", \"It's been said that Batman Begins in the first Batman movie to \\\"get it right\\\" but I think that's a horrible overstatement, for I think the new Batman film, although greater that Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, pales compared to Tim Burton's classics, with this one being the best of the five. The darkness is beautiful, as is the music and scenery, creating a Gotham City cloaked in mystery, unlike Batman Begins, where Gotham City is a normal-looking city. The villains are terrific in this movie. You literally can't take your eyes off of the penguin and cat woman. I applaud Tim Burton for being original with his use of the penguin as a freak, rather than an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old Batman TV show. In Batman Begins we have the scarecrow, whose not nearly as demanding on screen as the penguin or cat woman. The film doesn't need to focus only on Batman, because we already know his story, and it is the villains who we are exploring and trying to figure out, and they are the ones who create the plot, with the penguin running for mayor and seeking revenge for his parents' desertion by killing the first born sons of Gotham, a task he fails. Danny Devito gives the finest performance ever by a superhero villain in any film, surpassing even Nicholson's joker. The closing scene where the penguins drag the dead body of the penguin into the water is touching and powerful. It's a tragedy that Tim Burton wasn't allowed to complete his trilogy, since Warner Bros., interesting in marketing appeal, wanted to \\\"lighten\\\" the Batman movies up. And they got their wish...unfortunately. Tim Burton planned on directing the third film, using the Riddler as the villain, with no Two-Face and Robin to mess it up, and I'm sure Michael Keaton would've signed on. So this is the last great Batman Film. Batman Begins is dark, but boring, tedious, ordinary, filled with lackluster villains, and a playboy Bruce Wayne. A decent Batman film, but the best Batman film ever? Never. Batman Returns holds that crown.\", \"Batman Returns is a really dark movie, that shows the Caped Crusader fighting against the Penguin and the sexy Catwoman (I'll get to them later). Michael Keaton acts well as Bruce Wayne, showing he is a good actor. Tim BUrton directs this picture well, and the locations of the movie are impressive. The villains: Danny deVito is menacing as the Penguin. A cruel, yet disturbed man, that had a really hard childhood. But, Michelle Pfeiffer steals the picture. She is the BEST Catwoman ever! She is threatening, and extremely sexy. There's a scene where she kisses Batman the cat way that just heats the movie up. The action scenes are good too, and the ending is dramatic and tragic, probably the best ending of a Batman movie. Tim Burton shows he can manage a Batman movie really well (he already demonstrated this with the first Batman) and also gives Batman a darker nature. So much like him.\", \"I really wanted to be able to give this film a 10. I've long thought it was my favorite of the four modern live-action Batman films to date (and maybe it still will be--I have yet to watch the Schumacher films again). I'm also starting to become concerned about whether I'm somehow subconsciously being contrarian. You see, I always liked the Schumacher films. As far as I can remember, they were either 9s or 10s to me. But the conventional wisdom is that the two Tim Burton directed films are far superior. I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman this time around--I ended up giving it a 7--and apologize as I might, I just couldn't help feel that Batman Returns just has too many small direction, plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a 10.  But Burton _almost_ trumps the problems with sheer force of style, and even though there are a lot of small flaws, Batman Returns is still a great film, especially if you're a Burton fan, as Batman Returns has just as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) as it does with anything else in the Batman universe.  The film begins strongly, with the Cobblepots having a baby. We see their dismay--people walk out of the birthing room with horror on their faces, ready to vomit. Later, they have the baby in a small cage. Finally they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the Gotham City River. The baby ends up becoming Batman villain The Penguin (Danny DeVito).  Meanwhile, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is the film's \\\"evil capitalist\\\", comparable to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He is planning on duping Gotham City in various ways, and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary, the timid Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots, Grissom tries to get rid of her, but she is rescued by cats, becoming Catwoman.  While all of this is going on, The Penguin, who has long been only rumored to exist and who is thought to be dangerous, begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy, despite having less than benevolent, ulterior motives.  Before re-watching Burton's Batman films this time, I didn't remember just how little the films are about Batman (Michael Keaton). It's almost as if Burton didn't feel the character was interesting enough to focus on. The focus here is much more on the villains, especially The Penguin. Batman doesn't appear very often, especially in the beginning of the film, and surprisingly often, we're watching him watching The Penguin.  Although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw, I can't say that I do, even if I'd like to know more about Batman and follow his story more. The villains' stories are interesting, too, and as an \\\"origin story\\\" for two major Batman villains, Batman Returns is already more than complex in terms of plot.  However, there are some character problems that I do count as a flaw. The Penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do his bidding, but even though they're frequently on screen, we never get to learn anything about them. Burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those in Tod Browning's Freaks (1932) available, with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli, but he just doesn't have the space to use them.  For that matter, he hardly has space to explore Catwoman. The film plays as if Catwoman may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as The Penguin, but that cut of the film would have been 4 hours long. So the bulk of the Catwoman scenes had to be excised. Of course, all of this barely leaves any room for Batman. Burton has Batman turn very dark in the public's eye in this film, and unusually, he never bothers to resolve this. As far as we know, at the end, Gothamites still think that Batman is a murdering lunatic. That's an interesting development, but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the next.  As for the script, although there are minor problems including some non-sequiturs and bizarre decisions (in terms of logic) made by characters, it's clear that Burton and writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story. A lot of the dialogue is pun-oriented, but often this is fairly subtle and/or complex (of course, sometimes it is very blatant or transparent, too). It helps to look at Batman Returns as a more \\\"poetic\\\" film, as I believe was the intention. This also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisions--plenty of odd character actions, including from minor characters, are done in service of a general mood or style, and that style works very well.  \\\"Dark\\\" is the easiest way to sum up Batman Returns in a word, and whether that's a positive or negative depends on your disposition. Anyone who knows me knows that I love dark. So for me, Burton's style largely transcends the flaws in the plot and the script. In many ways, Batman Returns is like an insane, campy horror film, with beautifully eerie production design. Like Batman, Burton is still making many references to other films, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977) (well, there's still a slight Star Wars reference), he invokes films like Nosferatu (1922) (including that \\\"Max Schreck\\\" was the name of the actor who played the Dracula-like character there), Motel Hell (1980), the aforementioned Freaks, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (which has a surreal, dark edge to it) and zombie films--made most explicit in The Penguin's final scene.  In terms of visuals and general atmosphere--and that includes the general \\\"feel\\\" of the story, the characters and so on--this couldn't be a stronger 10.\", \"Tim Burton the man behind the original Batman film and Beetlejuice, brings the world the sequel to Batman, that exceeds the original in more ways than one. Firstly Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a great mix of Batmans enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to rattle some heads within the story and penguin works in the same way that the joker worked in the original. The sets are stunning and immaculate. Gotham city has so many dark alleyways that you could never know what's happening at one time or another. The only thing that gives it a bad name is its script, which at times seems to lapse and then not recover for while. Tim Burtons direction bring superhero films into a new realm. Beats all the superman films and the other Batman films by a mile. Though in terms of realisation the new Batman begins has a bite where this one lacks, but Burton is a more original director than Nolan.\", \"I don't know why critics cal it bizarre and macabre. I really don't. Dark -yes, bizarre - no. It i s sad and with lots of emotions, specially with the Pinguin's story. They say it has elements of S&M but I really don't find anything of that sort except for Catwoman's whip.  This movie is deeper than its genre and villains aren't just some crazy freaks dressed like on a masquerade. They have strong motives with strong feelings involved. Catwoman (a great performance by Michelle Pfeifer!) isn't just a sexy chick who likes steeling jewels - she's on her personal crusade and Pinguin... well, by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him (strong performance by Danny DeVito). Again, I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman and he carries his costume well.  You can totally see that it is a Tim Burton movie, because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. But also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions.\", \"Many of us find art agreeable only when the masterpiece itself touches something deep inside us. That is, the completed creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can somehow personally relate to it. It was winter, here in Australia 1992 when I had seen Batman Returns at the cinemas and it blew me away. Both \\\"me's\\\". I was supposed to belong to an ideal, a standard, but at the same time I was living another life. Tim Burton was the first film maker to say its OK for a comic movie to be dark and to confess that darkness can happen to us all. After Tim Burton's Batman interpretations, many other dark comic book heroes and anti-heroes flooded the cinemas. Comic book folklore for decades had told of friendly, likable heroes with dashingly handsome smiles and magical superpowers who fly in the sky, and spun powerful webs from their wrists and wore red boots and had the strength of a locomotive. But what happens when you are only ten years old and you see your parents coldly executed in front of your very eyes? You snap. Somewhere in your psyche,your young tender psychological make up breaks apart. The only way such pain and hurt can be managed is to create an alternate persona.You make a promise. Your other self will be stronger, harness all the anger all the rage to use whatever means available to avenge the innocence of your parents onto that criminal, those criminals, any criminal. This is life seen through Bruce Wayne's eyes. Both pairs. The world he sees is dark, gloomy, and cold. Although he patrols the streets and people hear him cruise by, they don't rush out to get his autograph. He is their Saviour, not the winner of a personality contest. Batman Returns is about losers. Batman, for yet another Christmas, remains \\\"the only lonely man beast in town\\\". Bruce Wayne never gets to lawfully arrest the vile Max Shreck. The Penguin never gets to unleash his pain of being discarded by his parents onto the citizens of Gotham, and Selina Kyle is forever lost to being mentally fragmented and traumatized. And the hero doesn't get the girl- or cat.This movie delves into the desire in all of us to want so desperately to belong, to have a home, as expressed by Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot.The film brings out a need in all of us to be heard, respected and not ignored as desired by Selina Kyle , Oswald and of course Bruce Wayne. But sometimes we are all suppressed in one way or another, we are told to be an ideal, to behave to a certain standard. That is until we finally snap. Only hope remains at the end of the movie as we see Catwoman rise towards the night sky. But come what may we all must wish good will towards all men and women. As for me , I cant say that I will reach a point where I will believe my problem with duality will be reconciled. But thats OK. We all have a dark side. Batman Returns is not only the best of the Batman films ,it is truly a stand out exceptionally fine masterpiece of storytelling.\", \"Ah, Batman Returns, is it possible to have a sequel to be almost as good as the original? With Batman Returns, it came pretty close! We have terrific actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains, Catwoman and The Penguin. We have Michael Keaton back as Batman and he's still awesome than ever. Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly cast into place. As much as I love and is such an incredible actress Annette Benning, she couldn't have been Catwoman, she doesn't really have the look. Danny DeVito, who could have imagined him as The Penguin? He was just great and terrifying!   Batman returns with a more loving community of Gotham City, they are celebrating Christmas time with, Max Shrek played by a creepy Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who mistreats his lovely secretary, Selina who happens to hear too much at his office causing him to push her out the window in hopes that she dies and will never reveal the information of knowing the Penguin and the attempt to make him loved in Gotham. When she survives and is awakened by cats, she wants revenge and is ready to go at it with her cats! But there is also another active villain, The Penguin who is in search of his parents that abandoned him and now he is looking to be the new mayor of Gotham City! Can Batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their hanous acts and stop the mayor from destroying the city as well?  You'll have to see! Batman Returns is just as good as the original Batman, despite the first one remaining the true classic, this one still takes you for a ride. And come on, I mean we've got Michelle in leather! Her classic moment of just meeting Batman and The Penguin \\\"Meow\\\" is classic! There are memorable characters, lines, and sets! You'll have a blast! Trust me!   9/10\", \"And a perfect film to watch during the holiday season as the winter/Xmas atmosphere that Burton creates for Gotham City is way cool. It's weird that Warner decided to release this as a summer film. It doesn't fit.  But what's even weirder, when you consider the content of this film, is that it was aimed at families. An upper-class family throws their mutant baby down the sewer, a socio phobic billionaire dresses up in leather as a flying rodent, a lonely secretary dresses up in leather as a feline and a freak runs for political office. And S&M and bondage are presented in a very perverted way. But Burton got away with it. His visual style in this film is at it's best.  This and Batman: Dead End are the only true live-action incarnations of the comic-book character. True, the animated series was the closest to the source material, but compared with Batman Forever and the un-nameable one after that, Batman Returns is the best of the four.  Darker and more violent than the first movie, the sense of Gothic pathos reaches a new high. I was quite keen on Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne (don't even get me started on George Clooney!), he displayed the right balance of weirdo loner and cool crime fighter. Michelle Pfieffer is great as Catwoman (much sexier and more 'realisticly' cat-like), she wears that leather outfit better than Halle Berry. And Danny DeVito was so convincing as the Penguin that his scenes became disturbing to watch. And Christopher Walken is brilliant as the spooky Max Shreck (if you think you recognise Chip Shrek it's none other than a very young Leatherface/Butterfinger).  Danny Elfman's score is also even better than it was first time round. His powerful and engaging themes are way better than the dross that followed in the later 2 Schumacher movies. This movie is the Batman phenomenon at its Zenith. Forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series after this. Let's hope that Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale can bring some integrity back to the live action Batman with their movie next year.  This DVD was one of the first ever DVDs released by Warner (almost 7 years ago!!!) and as a result there are NO features and the case is a snapper. Pick it up cheap like I did and hope for an SE in the future.\", \"Out of all the Bat-films, Batman Returns is my favorite. This beautiful, dark, and funny film is one of Tim Burton's best work. Although it is much violent and darker, this is the Batman that creator Bob Kane envisioned many years ago. Michael Keaton reprises his role as the avenger of Gotham City. This time he's up against two deadly foes, Danny Devito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. With a great cast and film score by Danny Elfman, the movie takes us on an adventure as Batman battles the evil forces that are trying to take over Gotham City. Christopher Walken makes a great appearance as Max Shrek, a shrewd businessman who has an evil scheme up his sleeve. But of course, Michelle Pfeiffer is the one that steals the show. With all of these components, you have a film that will blow you away. This is the reason why you go to the movies. It's got everything. It's really a shame that Tim Burton didn't get to direct the other sequels. If so I think the franchise would still be going strong today. Batman Returns is an awesome experience for fans that like cool movies.\"], \"review_score\": [8, 7, 7, 10, 10, 9, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10, 9, 10, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10, 7, 10, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 9, 10, 10], \"review_category\": [\"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 9.133333333333333}, \"Batman and Robin\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0041162\", \"total_review_count\": 3, \"total_rating_count\": 3, \"review_content\": [\"there is no suspense in this serial!

Watch the 60s version, or the 90's versions, or even Batman Begins, just anything over this version!\", \"...this would have been what you got.  Words alone cannot describe how bad this is. If you're having trouble sleeping pop this in and I guarantee you'll be out in fifteen minutes.  Robert Lowery was a pretty good actor in the 40s-- but he's phoning it in here. In an interview, Johnny \\\"Duncan\\\" Robin said that in one scene he and Batman had to run from the car to the house and that Lowery was doubled over out of camera range because his girdle was too tight! Duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder-- in fact he's more like a guy in his thirties waiting for Lowery to kick off so he can wear the big cape.  Driving a Batmobile that looks like it rolled off Honest Al's Used Car lot at below sticker price-- the Dynamic Duo don't put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that it's Bruce Wayne's car they're driving-- in fact it's noted by several characters throughout the serial.  The acting is wooden-- the sets are cheap-- the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following I'm sure it read along the lines of \\\"Batman says something here\\\" because it certainly seems like they're making it up as it goes along.  Batman's Utility belt is made out of thin fabric with no apparent pouches to hold his gadgets-- in one scene when Batman needs a full size blow torch the producers just tuck one in as the scene starts-- never to be seen again. His cowl is so bad he can't even see out of it and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the disgruntled easter rabbit than they do anything batlike.  In one scene (I am not making this up), Batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some hoods. It's radioactive so he can trace it-- the reason it's so highly flammable isn't explained. Well, unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse-- we know it's a cardboard warehouse because Batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that look to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out-- and soon the whole place burns to the ground. Thanks Batman!  In another scene after the Batmobile is disabled, Batman flags down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car-- leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to worry because if Batman smashes up the car the police will surely buy him another one! Yes, you guessed it, said car careens off a cliff within a few short seconds. Not that it matters much to the motorist who has probably died from exposure trying to hoof his way back to Gotham City.  There is a tired subplot with Lois Lane clone Vicki Vale who is convinced Bruce Wayne is Batman-- she must have noticed the Batmobile parked outside of Bruce's house-- or maybe she saw Batman and Robin running up the walk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood.  Everything about this serial is bad-- and all but the youngest in the audience will want to hurl toast at the screen. IF you're looking for bad cinema you could not hit a better mark-- if you want entertainment, try the Burton Batman films, the Adam West Batman TV Series or the earlier Lewis Wilson Batman serial.\", \"Granting the budget and time constraints of serial production, BATMAN AND ROBIN nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any \\\"cliffhanger\\\" list, utterly lacking the style, imagination, and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor, BATMAN.  The producer, Sam Katzman, was known as \\\"King of the Quickies\\\" and, like his director, Spencer Bennett, seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement. (Unfortunately, this team also produced the two Superman serials, starring Kirk Alyn, with their tacky flying animation, canned music, and dull supporting players.) The opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come: thoroughly inane titles (\\\"Robin Rescues Batman,\\\" \\\"Batman vs Wizard\\\"), mechanical music droning on, and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around, either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap Halloween masks. Batman's cowl, with its devil's horns and eagle's beak, fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes. His \\\"utility belt\\\" is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments, from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments!  In any case, the lead players are miscast. Robert Lowery displays little charm or individual flair as Bruce Wayne, and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as Batman. He creates the impression that he'd rather be somewhere, anywhere else! John Duncan, as Robin, has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue. He is too old for the part, with an even older stuntman filling in for him. Out of costume, Lowery and Duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink, without one ounce of the chemistry evident between Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft in the 1943 serial.  Although serials were not known for character development, the earlier BATMAN managed to present a more energetic cast. This one offers a group going through the motions, not that the filmmakers provide much support. Not one of the hoodlums stands out, and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever, \\\"The Wizard.\\\" (Great name!) Actually, they are led by someone sporting a curtain, a shawl, and a sack over his head, with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing. The \\\"prime suspects\\\" -- an eccentric professor, a radio broadcaster -- are simply annoying.  Even the established comic book \\\"regulars\\\" are superfluous. It is hard to discern much romance between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne. Despite the perils she faces, Vicki displays virtually no emotion. Commissioner Gordon is none-too-bright. Unlike in the previous serial, Alfred the butler is a mere walk-on whose most important line is \\\"Mr Wayne's residence.\\\" They are props for a drawn-out, gimmick-laden, incoherent plot, further saddled with uninspired, repetitive music and amateurish production design. The Wayne Manor exterior resembles a suburban middle-class home in any sitcom, the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel. The Batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing. (The costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet!)  Pity that the filmmakers couldn't invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure. While the availability of the two serials on DVD is a plus for any serious \\\"Batfan,\\\" one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box.

What a great cast and director. Well, it was outstanding in the way it looked; beautifully filmed, visually capturing the era and mood. But the script was absolutely awful. I couldn't work up any interest in what was happening regarding the story or characters. Rather than capturing the film noir experience, this film was like a Carol Burnett send-up of the genre without the Burnett humor. The only other positive I can say is that it was great to hear/see k.d.lange sing and Mia Kirshner's Dahlia conveyed the inner sadness of her character very well. Hillary's performance comes across as a cartoon: a 2006 actress dressed up for Halloween as a 1947 femme fatale. Oh, why couldn't the rest of the film match the beautiful cinematography!\", \"I was so disappointed! I had been waiting to see this film for so long, and I think I expected something totally different. I thought the acting was over-the-top and too exaggerated, for example, the swell of 'sexy' 40's era music that played every time Scarlett Johanssen appeared in a scene. Granted, Scarlett was BEAUTIFUL in this movie, she's such a classic beauty, an she was perfect for the time period. However, whenever there was a serious/suspenseful information-revealing type of moment in the movie, the camera would linger on her face for ages while Scarlett's eyebrows furrowed and lips quivered while we waited for her to give a breathless answer of some sort. The love scenes couldn't have had less chemistry, with their contrived spontaneity, and clumsy ripping-off of clothing, and the constant comparison of Hillary Swank's character and Mia Kirshner's character who were supposed to bear an uncanny resemblance to each other in the film, when in reality they look absolutely nothing alike. Not to mention the confusing side crime story that I'm still attempting to decipher three hours after seeing the movie. I will say that the cinematography was great, and the costuming was perfect. But, I was very disappointed with the film in its entirety.\", \"I'm not sure where to begin. The cinematography/editing of this movie was terrible. Colors were frequently washed out, the 360-degree shot in the briefing room was out of focus, on and on...Continuity/fact checking left much to be desired, too, like the cash register at the diner that clearly shows \\\"4d\\\" on it's \\\"display\\\" (4 pence? in an American diner?) All of the actors were just abysmal. The dialog was laughably bad. And the story: It made no sense, bouncing like a pinball from here to there and then wrapping everything up in a nice, tidy package in the last 5 minutes as if DePalma said \\\"Uhoh, running out of film, let's wrap this up!\\\" There are great movies, good movies, mediocre movies, bad movies, and then there's the Black Dahlia.\", \"Parts of this move kinda make you want to laugh. For instance, seeing K.D. Lang singing lovingly to the audience as the headliner in a swank, upscale lesbian night club (apparently 1947 Hollywood was well represented with swank clubs of this sort), where her entourage sort of melts into a lesbian orgy as part of her act (at least I guess it was supposed to be part of her act).  Or, when poor cop Josh Hartnett and socialite Hillary Swank engage in carnal relations in a seedy motel, and afterwards, as he, sitting in bed, is lighting up cigarettes for the two of them while she cuddles near him, is still wearing his fedora while she still wears her pearls. I'll bet keeping that fedora on must have been quite a trick.  Anyway, the major problem with this film is that it unsuccessfully tries to combine several film noir classics into one movie. For instance, you have the rich father with the two strange daughters (\\\"The Big Sleep\\\"), the seemingly separate plots that may have more in common than at first glance (\\\"Murder my Sweet\\\"), and the character whose obsession may lead toward a certain road of destruction (\\\"The Postman Always Rings Twice,\\\" \\\"Double Indemnity\\\"), etc. What you are left with is a hodgepodge of sometimes incomprehensible threads in which some of the essential characters to the development of the story aren't introduced until near the end of the movie! Another problem with this movie is director Brian De Palma's apparent obsession with lesbians. The movie is basically lesbian this and lesbian that; lesbian singer, lesbian night clubs, lesbian stag films (with device), and lesbian confessions (\\\"I only slept with her once. Honest!\\\"). This film, along with \\\"Hollywoodland,\\\" seems intent on informing us uneducated hicks from the heartland that homosexuality existed before 1990. Duu-uuh!!! Now, for the good parts and the trivia parts. One scene consists of two policemen staking out a building where they expect to find a child molester. I'm not going to describe the scene, but it is reminiscent of the famous opening sequence of Orson Welles' \\\"Touch of Evil.\\\" Mr. De Palma filmed the scene right. Impressive.  Though the movie begins to drag when it for too long replaces mystery with romance, the film does have one really good scene of unrelenting Hitchcock-like suspense.  The photography is first rate and beautiful.  The classic cars are a wonder to behold.  Some of the music score reminds one of the works of film composer Bernard Herrman.  Two trivia items: The marquee of one movie theater advertises \\\"The Black Angel,\\\" a 1947 film noir based upon the novel by Cornell Woolrich (\\\"Rear Window\\\"), who is considered to be one of the founders of this genre of suspense.  One scene in this film shows the action through the eyes of Josh Hartnett. You do not see him; you see only the faces of those he is talking with as the camera turns from individual to individual, showing us all through Hartnett's eyes. This device was previously used for almost an entire film by Robert Montgomery (Elizabeth's dad) when he played Philip Marlowe in \\\"Lady in the Lake.\\\" (No, that inferior, insipid, little horror movie was not the first to use this device. Sorry!) So, I am guessing that Mr. De Palma was paying homage to film noirs of the past. Too bad he didn't wait until he had better material to do it with.  Your better bets: Everything mentioned above.\", \"Wow! I never believed I would be saying this about one of DePalma's movies, but here it goes: the is the worst movie he has ever made. Some of this was adapted from Ellroy's 1987 novel of the same name, but all in all this movie sucked. There were too many pieces of the puzzle that tried to fit together but just couldn't. Also it leaves you with asking a lot more questions after the movie than before seeing the movie. You are introduced to characters that have no relevance to the story or do hot make sense as to why they are there. All in all this movie is just one giant mess. I had been intrigued about the Elizabeth Short murder a couple of weeks ago when the Sunday paper I read had an insert that was a reprint from 1947 about the killing of the Black Dahlia. I figured this movie would be shot much more darkly than what I actually did see. But really the movie was just one giant collage: different pieces of the puzzle that you could fit together to express a theme, but as a story it fell far short. My advice: wait for DVD.\", \"Like many, I had high expectations for this film. And like many other reviews I've read here on the IMDb, I agree that the cinematography was well done, it was ridiculous to the point of comedy and there were a few moments in the film that almost saved it but bottom line up front, it was a huge disappointment. This movie was probably about everything except the Black Dahlia murder or Elizabeth Short. If that's what holds your interest about this movie, read about it in the Crime Library instead, this movie should have been called Boring Love Triangle Story With Quirky And Shocker Parts That Almost Save It But Don't Oh Yeah And Lots Of Eye Candy. The End.\", \"SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE THE DEAD GIRL, YOUR THE SICK ONE-- has got to be the funniest line that was not intended to be funny in the whole movie- I laughed, along with the rest of the theater, for about 2 minutes after that-- and then when the Voice Over comes on and its SCARElett's voice repeating it again, I just could not contain my laughter anymore! Go see it just for that alone! The movie is not great at all- it tries to come across as all serious and drama filled but comes off as a bad Saturday Night Live sketch! Apparently, Josh Hartnett thinks all it takes is a furrowed look with his eyebrows to demonstrate any of his emotions. They should have gotten an actor who is older then Josh- he did not fit the bill as a detective-- he looks too much like 2006, then a character from 1940's. The best acting was done my Mia, who played the Black Dahlia-- she gave a great performance in a limited role. Hillary Swank came off as a bad drag queen impersonator while we find out too late why Aaron Eckhardt's character is in such turmoil over the death of the Black Dahlia. When we do find out the truth, we don't care anymore. Too much happens at the end and it was like a student cramming for a midterm 5 minutes before the test begins. So much is thrown at us in the last 5 minutes of the movie- characters, motives, red herrings, misunderstandings, that I needed a score card to keep track of who was with who and who knew what with who. Its a movie you should rent-- only so u can pause and rewind to understand what was thrown at you in the last few minutes of the movie. It was like the director thought the movie was too long so he just threw everything in at once to tie up loose ends, when all it does is create more questions then answers. Scarlette apparently thinks by smoking a long cigarette and pouting she is transformed to the 1940's but in every movie why does she come across as bored and dull. Will the Black Dahila murder be solved, will the good guys prevail, will Josh Hartnett learn to act, will the scenery hold up after Aaron Echardt's chews threw the movie- acting docile one moment, then out of control in the next-- find out when you see the Black Dahlia.... on video of course, after your friend buys it.\", \"Oh, what high expectations I had. Fifteen minutes into this, I knew I was in for an exceptionally long two hours. I, personally, have researched as much as I possibly could on the case long before the movie came out...and the only thing that actually lived up to true drama of the real events was the crime scene. It was very accurate...but that's all that is going for this film. Throughout, you simply become bored to tears. Most of the time, I was left confused and often amused by the overacting. There are still parts that I can't understand or don't see the significance. The film did not GO anywhere up until the very end, and even the dramatic parts weren't very exciting. This movie had nothing to draw you in, and by the end it leaves one feeling unsatisfied. The Black Dahlia definitely could have been done so much better then it was, it was all just a jumbled mess.\", \"I so much wanted to like this movie. Even when bad reviews started coming in from the Festival it opened in. I thought to myself \\\"maybe it's just misunderstood to those unfamiliar with Ellroy's novel\\\" But frankly, it just never felt right,,, and then it went more and more uncomfortably wrong; the actors in their roles, the soundtrack vs. certain scenes, the story fumbling it's way around with not enough mention of The Dahlia herself (which really drove the characters in the novel). There were parts of the book that got left out which shouldn't have been, while there we're other parts 'put in' that could've been 'left out'. 'L.A. Confidential' was a longer and more complex book than Ellroy's 'The Black Dahlia', yet Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland knew what was necessary to move the story forward without getting in 'over their heads' in making it a functional screenplay. And that is where this movie fails miserably (along with the other fore-mentioned issues). It is however beautifully shot and lit in many scenes, but even a polished turd is still a turd, and that is essentially what you have here with DePalma's latest offering. This movie could lead to a new future in moving making and subsequent DVD extra's; Alternate Actors, Soundtrack and Screenplay? Because that's the only way this could be saved.\", \"I was so excited to see this movie, but when it ended, I was at a whole new level of angry. The film threw so much pointless junk at you, that it was hard to follow the movie. The film is supposed to be about the death of Elizebeth Shore. Unfortunately, they actually focus very little on that topic.  There are about 100 other things happening during the film, and 99 of them are irrelevant. I mean, the writing is terrible. This is another one of those films where third party, completely random characters become the culprits, and defeat the purpose of getting to know the main characters in the first place.  The positive things that I can say is that they do sort of tie some things together at the end (although the results will only serve to tick most people off). Hartnett does do a good job, and the film is visually fun to watch.  Aside from those things, it was bad. Don't see it. Save your money for Hollywoodland.\", \"This movie could have been called absolutely anything. It shouldn't, however, have been called \\\"The Black Dahlia.\\\" If your going to base a story on real events then there should be at least some similarities to the truth! This movie had no connection to any real events at all (The real life victim never made a film of any kind, porn or otherwise.) And, the fiction story that was presented was not all that enthralling. It is often said that truth is stranger than fiction, which is certainly true in this case. A story based on the real story of the Black Dahlia could have made an excellent movie. But they chose to create a total fiction with no basis in fact at all. I felt ripped off by this Black Dahlia impostor!\", \"The Black Dahlia turned out to be even worse than I imagined it could be. Had it not been for the lovely date I had, I would have been angry.  The Black Dahlia is twenty-first century film noir. It is miraculous all the actors made it through the filming without lung cancer. I've never seen more people smoke in one film.  Josh Hartnett is just too boyish looking to pull of the role he played. He is miscast.  Aaron Eckhart is guilty of over acting and over acting, over and over.  Scarlet Johanson seemed to act very little and I feel she was miscast as well.  The brightest spot, in a long, tedious trudge, is Hilary Swank. She is cast to perfection and portrays the nefarious Madeleine, deliciously.  Alas, the poor Mia Kirshner. Her performance of Elizabeth Short is so forgettable, it may work in her favor.  According to IMDb, the budget was $50,000,000. If I had my druthers, I would have rather seen 10 $5,000,000 independent art house movies.  The Black Dahlia appears to be another example of the Hollywood suits' inability to invest huge sums of money intelligently. I suppose next it will be \\\"The Return of the Black Dahlia\\\".\", \"Artistically, this movie should get some extra points. The use of color, the sharp contrast of black and white, good and evil, and so on. Based on that, I'd probably give the movie a 3.  However, to put it simply, the plot and acting in this movie is terrible. Here is me fundamental rule in movies: You have to actually CARE about the characters and what they were going through. And, trust me, I didn't care. Admittedly, the introduction was quite compelling, and I was drawn in a bit. However, after the introduction, my mind slowly turned to mush and my eyes de-focused. This is my altruistic warning to the masses: Don't watch this movie.\", \"I wanted to love it, but Brian De Palma's \\\"The Black Dahlia\\\" is a flat, paceless, uninvolving, constipated bore. It bears few of the director's signature set pieces, and possesses none of the energy of classics like \\\"Body Double\\\". \\\"Dressed To Kill\\\", \\\"Blow Out\\\" and \\\"Scarface\\\". Based on the rambling, seedy novel by James Elroy, which I read and enjoyed very much over a decade ago, this filmization of the novel fails in its casting, structure and set design. Although the film's period Los Angeles has all the trappings of ye olde Hollywoodland, it looks like a movie set. Josh Hartnett is totally unconvincing in his central role, as is the highly masculine Hillary Swank as a \\\"femme fatale\\\" (give me a break! she belongs in an Almodovar movie!) who sucks Hartnett into a convoluted web and her unappealing mouth. Scarlett Johannsen, who looks ravishing in a shot or two, is weak as water, and owns little screen presence. The narrative is unbelievably matter-of-fact and most of the film's surprise \\\"revelations\\\" are plain silly. More conservative critics have focused on the film's \\\"sleaze\\\" and \\\"trashiness\\\". If ONLY there was more sleaze and trash. This is lightweight film noir that will will send most viewers back to the video store to rent the DVD of \\\"LA Confidential\\\", an excellent adaptation of another Elroy novel. This turgid celluloid clunker is something I will soon forget.\", \"\\\"The Black Dahlia\\\" is a long, bloated, confusing, self-important, self-consciously artsy movie undermined by miscasting, absurd plot turns, naive symbolism, an utter disdain for history and laughable overacting that make Robert Towne's ponderous, plodding \\\"Chinatown\\\" sequel, \\\"Two Jakes\\\" (1990), look like a taut thriller.  The most marked difference between \\\"Dahlia\\\" and other classics of the more recent genre is that although \\\"L.A. Confidential\\\" is firmly planted in the 1950s and \\\"Chinatown\\\" takes place in the 1930s, De Palma's film has shallow roots \\\"once upon a time in Los Angeles.\\\" Clearly, a movie nominally set in 1943-47 in which the lead characters attend a silent movie (\\\"The Man Who Laughs, \\\" 1928--note that the characters are sitting in the balcony, which was reserved for blacks back in the ugly days of segregation. Oops!) has nothing but contempt for the past, which is reflected in a thousand ways, from male actors' scruffy haircuts and inability to wear hats properly to a laughable lesbian nightclub scene featuring K.D. Lang in top hat and tails singing \\\"Love for Sale,\\\" which rather than depicting the classic film noir era is most evocative of \\\"Bugsy Malone,\\\" a far more accurate film.  One can find fatal flaws in virtually every area of this movie with little effort\\u0097in fact the most difficult task in critiquing the film is remembering everything that's wrong with it.  First, there's Josh Friedman's dialog: \\\"She looks like that dead girl! How sick are you?\\\"\\u0097not quite \\\"She's my sister and my daughter,\\\" is it? Then there's miscasting (at 31, Kirshner is much too old to play the 22-year-old Black Dahlia), opulent production design by Dante Ferretti (police officers lived like this on LAPD pay? Who knew?), music (Mark Isham in the entirely predictable \\\"cue mournful trumpet\\\" genre), odd costuming\\u0097Friday casual for the men, fall collection for the women\\u0097(Jenny Beavan), down to the crowd scenes, which are busy to the point of distraction. And I wish I had the cigarette holder franchise on this film. I would be a rich man.  Even special effects are misused, with an earthquake that serves no purpose except to underline an obvious plot turn. Granted, the overly complex story is almost impossible to follow, but in this instance, De Palma must assume the audience has an IQ of about 50. And unlike the shocking and painfully realistic nose-slitting scene in \\\"Chinatown,\\\" the far worse violence inflicted on the Black Dahlia is amusingly fake. If De Palma was hoping to make a slasher flick, he failed badly.  Nor does Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography escape a rap on the knuckles for a ridiculous lesbian stag film (presumably made at a cost surpassing the combined budgets of all blue movies produced from the 1920s to the 1950s), and a self-conscious and overly elaborate shot in which partners Blanchard (Eckhart) and Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) engage in a shootout, followed by the camera slowly rising up floor by floor of an entire apartment building, proceeding to a befuddling shot of the building's roof before it at last discovers the Black Dahlia's body in a vacant lot in the adjoining block. As visual storytelling, this is a grandiose and miserable failure.   And then there's Fiona Shaw, who chews so much scenery that she must have been rushed to an oral surgeon to have the splinters removed.  For that matter\\u0097and perhaps this is what makes the heart of the film beat so faintly\\u0097there is very little of the Black Dahlia in \\\"The Black Dahlia,\\\" who only surfaces far into the picture.  In fact, the first 30 or 40 minutes are devoted to boxing matches between the two detectives, nicknamed \\\"Fire\\\" and \\\"Ice\\\" from the Symbolism 101 school of writing. (I know it's in the book, but that's no excuse).  So where is the Black Dahlia in this confusing mess? She exists entirely on film. Of course in real life, Elizabeth Short never got a screen test or even appeared in a school play, but De Palma gives her one and Kirshner, trying her best at the impossible task of acting 22, makes it as pitiful as possible with an intentionally miserable reading of Vivian Leigh's famous monologue from \\\"Gone With the Wind.\\\"   The handling of the crime scene? Ridiculous even by Hollywood's lax standards. Vintage black-and-white police cars swarming the streets and detectives bellowing instructions like some shark-jumping 1970s cop show that any good investigator would already know. Ditto the morgue.  Then there's the contrasting love/sex scenes, and it's obvious De Palma hasn't a clue how to stage either one. The sex scene, between Harnett and Johansson, occurs in the dining room, when, overcome with passion, Bleichert rips away the tablecloth, sending dishes everywhere, and has his way with Lake. Isham's score is lushly romantic, an oddly contrasting choice of music, and amour like this is sure tough on the Havilland china and the Baccarat crystal.  The love scene, between Swank and Harnett, is just as amusing with Bleichert and Linscott having a little pillow talk while she's wearing nothing but huge pearl earrings and a long matching necklace with pearls the size of small onions, ensuring, I would imagine, a rather bumpy ride.  And about those crazy Linscotts. Bleichert knows exactly how to make rich people confess to murder: Use their valuable antiques for target practice. The last time I checked, police revolvers hold six rounds, so unless Bleichert was planning to fight off one of them as he reloaded I can't imagine what he thought he would do after his sixth question. Then again, not everybody can send a crystal chandelier crashing to the floor with one shot\\u0097some of us need two.  And while you're at it, Bucky, take out a couple of those clown paintings, please.\", \"Brian De Palma's so called \\\"film noir\\\" has all the aspects of a great film: detectives, guns, murder, a beautiful blonde, an Oscar winning brunette, and a boxing match. It involves violence, money, pimps, porn, and \\\"the most notorious murder in California history\\\". Sadly though, the movie just doesn't cut it.  The Black Dahlia isn't about murder, or guns, or pimps or porn. The Black Dahlia is about the new American dream: to sleep with Scarlett Johansson. The Dahlia isn't even introduced until a third of the movie is over, the longest 45 minutes I've ever experienced in cinema. A good hour of the movie doesn't have anything to do with the plot, and watching it is just like watching paint dry. Much of this wasted screen time is attributed to the relationship between Sgt. Leland \\\"Lee\\\" Blanchard (Aaron Eckert) and Officer. Dwight \\\"Bucky\\\" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett), where we see their transformation from enemies to partners to friends unrealistically fast, which is unrealistically clich\\u00e9.  But the biggest downside of the movie is Josh Hartnett. What Hartnett is doing as a serious actor is beyond me, but his performance is a wooden as they come. It is unbelievable that he was considered for the role of Bleichert, and the fact that he was cast really makes me lose faith in Hollywood's mainstream actors. His noir-ish voice-over was like reading words off the script, making it feel less and less like the artsy film De Palma intended it to be.  The only redeeming feature of the flick was Mia Kirshner who had about one minute of screen time as the Dahlia, but was the most memorable character. Oh, yeah, and we do get to see Hilary Swank's ass.  But overall, The Black Dahlia is just another bad film to cap off the summer. It is extremely confusing with all its pointless sub-plots, and just gets annoying at the end. It's one of those movies you consider walking out of, and I counted down the minutes to what I thought would be a climactic finale, but was just a series of long monologues and unclear speaking. In the end, we learned little about the Dahlia, and were pretty much back where we started, except for a few missing comrades.\", \"Brace yourself for some real truth. As you noticed on IMDb, this movie was advertised as \\\"Crime / Drama / Mystery / Thriller\\\". The trailer makes the movie look the same. Unfortunately, if you go to this movie with that in mind, you may and should be disappointed. When I see the genre described as it was, I want to see just that. Oh, you can add comic relief, maybe good music, some reasonable horror and nostalgia, but do not do what was done to The Black Dahlia.  They obviously didn't intend to make this a serious movie, but rather it was a cheap attempt to imitate a Film Noir sometimes, a TV mystery sometimes and then other times I don't think they knew what they actually wanted to do.  When I am sucked into a movie that I believe is going to be a mystery, I want to be able to enjoy the movie throughout and get involved in the mystery. In this case, the viewer has to spend far too much time trying to figure out what the movie is trying to do. Just give me the mystery that the movie is about. No one needs to make the movie-making process a mystery.  For those of you who are going just to see Scarlett Johansson, I have to say I am very disappointed in her. Her acting needs a lot of improvement or she needs to find movies that embrace her sensuality. Yeah, she is sexy in this movie, too, but her voice does not fit her actions and her acting is puzzling, not mysterious. I want the Scarlett I knew from \\\"Lost In Translation\\\" and \\\"American Rhapsody\\\" at least she could act and her voice fit her character. Other main characters were just as puzzling, however. And honestly, the best and most interesting characters were treated somewhat like extras, though one of those \\\"extras\\\" was by far the best actress in the movie.  You can call this an imitation Film Noir Graphic Novel that should have taken a more serious approach to even those genres.  I gave it a 4 out of 10 out of generosity.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Blade II\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0187738\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Blade\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0120611\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 30, \"review_content\": [\"Blade was a thrilling horror masterpiece and it was a brilliant movie with real great action, I cant wait for Blade 2, This is one of Wesley Snipes greatest movies, the acting is great the story line is great everything about this movie is great.\", \"Okay, sure, this movie is a bit on the hokey side. It's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, anyone?), but this tries very hard. I've never read the actual comic book, but that doesn't really matter, I suppose. I judge a film mainly on its merits, not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea. (Unless its a film based on a true story, that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy.) So why will I give this movie a fairly high rating? Because it tries. It tries very hard. In my book, that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining film.  Many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus. It seems everybody has their take on vampire lore, be it the cross, the silver, the garlic, the aversion to sunlight, whatever. Some of those ideas are included here. The storyline is familiar... a group of vampires conspire to take over the world, with one person (mainly) standing in their way. Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses, who have slowly but surely moved into the world, and share it with humankind. For the most part, the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them. The vampires have even taken familiars, people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires' dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being \\\"turned.\\\"  Now that I think of it, there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the Roddy Piper film, They Live. A hidden enemy, hidden group of people plotting against them, the fight to save human-kind... all that is present in Blade as well.  The acting isn't the best here. Snipes is, at best, only slightly better than some of his other roles; N'Bushe Wright, a relative newcomer, isn't too bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgettable as Blade's sidekick (he's to Blade what Chip is to The Punisher). Stephen Dorff does the best job of the whole cast here, as the \\\"head\\\" vampire you just love to hate.  I don't know, but I just loved the special effects in this film. From the blood-soaked vampire-style rave, all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film, the special effects aren't half bad. There's certainly enough blood and gore to go around, but after all, this is a vampire movie, right? The various shapes and sorts of weaponry Blade uses are fairly unique, and not generally used in contemporary action films. Snipes has more flair with a decked-out sword than he does with, say, a machine gun. Plus, there's so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away. (Unless, of course, you are Indiana Jones.)  Overall, this isn't the best action film ever made, but it's not half bad, either. As a bonus, the musical score & soundtrack are pretty cool, too. Tell me, in what other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like Source Direct or Photek?!  My Rating: 8/10\", \"hi  Blade is an sensational action movie . the hero (Wesley Snipes) and the villain have done justice to their roles.  The movie's action sequences are better then Matrix!   Wesley Snipes is one the best action heroes ever.  If u like action/vampire movies , this is the ONE.  the theme is pretty good considering the fact that so many vampire movies have been made before.But these is the best of them.  Enjoy the Ride.\", \"It's got action and fantasy mixed all together what more do you want in an action movie? And it also has one of the best martial artists in the movie industry today, Wesley snipes.So all in all this movie hasn't left anything out. And that's my comment of what I think is a classic beat em up movie.\", \"Not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series, I expected this film to merely accomplish the basic: introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics, present a plot, and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel. And that's exactly what this movie happens to deliver.  However, unlike with most other comic book movies, I felt that this one did it with a bit of class. Risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes, \\\"Blade\\\" presents a very modern, believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to elicit a sense of dread--as minor as it may have been--from a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional (i.e., sappy) aspect is concerned.  Yes, the movie has innumerable plotholes, and preposterously unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being astute enough to contrive what no one else has been able to for several thousand years. But when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie, and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this, what else matters? It may run a little long, but for what it sets out to do, \\\"Blade\\\" stands out in sharp relief among most other movies in this genre.\", \"In this film I prefer Deacon Frost. He's so sexy! I love his glacial eyes! I like Stephen Dorff and the vampires, so I went to see it. I hope to see a gothic film with him. \\\"Blade\\\" it was very \\\"about the future\\\". If vampires had been real, I would be turned by Frost!\", \"Blade is probably one of the best vampire/action movies ever made.It has it all:action,horror,blood.this movie is for action fans.It's either you like it a lot either you hate it and if you hate it ,it means you don't like action or vampires movies.Wesley snipes takes his role seriously and he his the perfect guy for blade\", \"Great underrated movie great action good actors and a wonderful story line. Wesley is verry good and the villain the bad guy is wonderful The girl plays a nice role and the comedy mixed with blakness!\", \"I loved it. In fact, I watched it over and over and over, and I could watch it again. This movie doesn't get boring.  The vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie. It's a job well done, great for today's generation.  Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has. Donal Logue provides great comical relief.  This vampire movie is like no other. I can't wait for Blade 2.\", \"this film was brilliant! i absolutely loved it! wesley snipes was great for this role - and i'm sure blade 2 would be just as good.  blade is by far one of my favorite action/horror movies out there! and if you havent seen it yet, and like vampires and blood (all that stuff) you should really rent it, because i assure you that you'll love it!\", \"I remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out, having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that I vowed to buy the video when it came out.   While I won't go too far into dissecting this film, I will say that I gave it an 8/10, for all the reasons you can read in the other user's reviews.  What I will say is this:   The first 10 minutes of this film are incredible. It's as close to a textbook audience grabber as I've ever seen. I once put this movie on at a party, where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave. I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed them the first ten minutes.  Everyone, who watched the opening, stayed to the end.\", \"This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it. It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever. I liked this one even more than X-men. In fact, this movie is sort of a cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before either. Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade. He is just not an emotionless super hero. Also, this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating. Sure comic books are for kids mainly, but I like a little more in my movies. Let's face it, if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic. This comic book adaptation also has something that many don't. A good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy. Let's face it, none of the Batman movies had a very good ending fight.\", \"This film is superb! Wesley Snipes Plays Blade the vampire hunter with pure class, he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make Bruce Lee proud. The movie is a fast paced, thrill ride of action and superb stunts. The first action scene and last are outstanding and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads. The script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too. Wesley should have done more action films than he has, i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all, only Bruce Willis, Stallone and perhaps Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star) come close. Also aswell as Wesley being quality, Steven Dorff is also very good as the bad guy. It was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to Snipes should come across as menacing, but he does. Overall the film is sharp, stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace.\", \"Interesting twist on the Vampire yarn - fast, loud and moody. Despite my initial fears Kris K carries his part reasonably well and Snipes aka Blade provides a formidable physical presence. Lots of blood, steel, silver, burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable :) 110 minute distraction. IF you like the black look of The Matrix then Blade will appeal to you, Blade even has a 'dodge the bullets' sequence.\", \"For a brief moment. The opening scene with Traci Lords and the  techno bar is incredible. I'd probably follow her to my ultimate death too! Best vampire movie of all time but with a twist. The fight scenes are awesome. Wesley Snipes displays an athleticism you dont get to see every day. And Stephen Dorff is impressive and very believable as an ambitious new recruit moving himself up the hierarchy by any means necessary. Great flick 9/10. Where's Blade II?\", \"However closely the movie is to the comics, it doesn't matter. This movie radically moves away from the boredom of \\\"Interview with the Vampire\\\" (although it's acting was good) and slides in the wonderful action scenes. Very convincing tale and interesting with surprisingly good acting from all. Disadvantage - poor graphics. Does it matter? Nope.\", \"In the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations, Blade is by far one of the best realised, and most faithful (overall) to the source material.... given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in Marvel's Tomb of Dracula, the writer took almost ALL of the characters and plot elements from the comic's history. While changes were inevitably made, the finer points of the film steamroll right over any criticisms. Don't let any of you friends tell you different: Blade is one fine film. If it feels too \\\"comic booky\\\" for you Stanley Kubrick snobs out there, it's because it's supposed to. Deal with it, but don't dis it for it.\", \"Blade is a dark, gloomy, but significent vampire movie and is one of the best ones. A bit of gore, but nothing really that bad. Wesley snipes played a strong role as he eliminates the vampires. Not really like buffy, because thats too tame but Blade delivers a decent plot and it's the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a dark stormy night....thats at best viewing!  87%\", \"Overall, I give this film a decent 7.6. To start I'll say I love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen. If you read comics occasionally or simply watch DVD extras you'll see the Blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film. Among the changes, Blade is now most importantly half vampire, therefore acquiring \\\"all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses.\\\" The credit for this goes obviously to David Goyer, a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books. Thanks to him Blade has become a much more interesting character and I find him one of my favorite anti-heroes really. Wesley Snipes is born to play this role, although some would've probably pererred Dezenel Washington or Will Smith (lol). His acting here doesn't need to be exactly Oscar winning per say considering the character but I'm glad he decids to play the DayWalker in the two sequels. Also starring is Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson as Blade's Alfred so to speak. The acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure. The opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts I've got to say. As much as like this movie there are few things that bother me which take away from this film ranking with something like \\\"Spider-Man\\\" or \\\"X-Men\\\". Stephen Norrington had the villains portrayed in a way I didn't like so much honestly. Their lines were so full of foul mouthed comedy it didn't really feel like a comic book film to me. Plus \\\"La Magra\\\" a bit disappointing as the final villain but the intense sword fight makes up for it I guess. Not to mention a sense of extra non-realism: a black man in a leather coat with a sword beaing the #$%^ out of a cop in broad day light some how going unnoticed by the crowds walking by seemed kinda..well...dumb. Moving away from a few of its flaws, the music by Mark Isham was great and fitted the film nicely. Luckily all these problems are fixed and improved on in the stunning sequel, \\\"Blade 2\\\".\", \"'Blade' would be an extremely above-average comic-book, vampire-hunter action/horror if it weren't for two minor flaws. #1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible Blade/Snipes do his slicing and dicing, but the whole \\\"Yes!\\\" fist/punch was literally a letdown. #2 Bad, no make that horrible, CGI \\u0096 even for 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some sprinkled throughout. Okay, despite those minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'Matrix' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior. So maybe 'The Matrix' copied 'Blade.' At any rate, it's a very movie for multiple genre-loving audiences: Comic Book geeks, action fanatics and horror/vampire lovers. So, we have Blade, half-man/half-vampire, or \\\"day-walker\\\" and his accomplish, Whisler (a la \\\"Batman and Alfred\\\") battling the undead who, apparently almost out number humans. Who knew? In a rare act of humanity (Blade's more of an antihero) our sword ninja/vamp rescues a newly infected (coincidentally) blood specialist/doctor. Meanwhile, trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants (you guessed it) supreme power and needs Blade somehow to obtain it. It's not the most original concept, if you read what I just wrote, but still highly enjoyable. You will want to see Blade succeed, you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms. And you will know what's coming as this is the typical act 1-2-3 of a comic book introduction movie. Still, watch this without trying to go too deep. Such as Vampire SPF-1000 \\\"suntan lotion\\\"? Really? What about the scalp? Wouldn't that still burn? Just like the money they burn for weapons? Uh, okay, I am going too deep. Once again, sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride.\", \"Hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I'll try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read!   Let's start with the good things! The quote \\\"strong bloody violence\\\" (which is used by rating boards, to describe the content of a movie, does fit here very well. This is not a movie for kids! Or for the faint of hearted! It has Blade as a central character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy enough story thread to hold/justify the action scenes! The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. The action scenes are great here too.  OK over to the things I didn't like. The overall story is too thin. It's enough as I've written above to hold the action scenes together, but there could be more. And a character like Blade deserves more (imo). The drama therefor isn't the best ... also it's use of clich\\u00e9s doesn't help. Some characters are underwritten ... That's that! :o)\", \"I admit I go more for the traditional vampire tale, but this one is a real winner. Lots of way out graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours. There was loads of gore with vicious blood suckers attacking mortals and even each other for control of the world. A good one for all us vampire lovers.\", \"It seems to me that a lot of people don't know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and the likes. What all these heroes (and in the case of X-Men hero group) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring. So boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the Marvel universe. At least until he was reinvented.  David Goyer did a stroke of genius when he took the character of Blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight. He can't take all the credit though and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character. The Blade character (Wesley Snipes) is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with Batman like darkness. Snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character. He is, however, a pretty rigid actor both in voice and in posture and is only interesting enough for one film (which is clearly seen from the inferior sequels). Kris Kristofferson is good as well and really brings the tormented character of Whistler to life with energy and sense of timing. N'Bushe Wright, however, is fairly weak as a leading lady making her character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a minor character. German, Udo Kier, should also be mentioned as he brings a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race, probably born of his experiences from playing Dracula. Stephen Dorf provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as Deacon Frost stands as one of the best screen villains I have perhaps ever seen.  The story is good and, I feel, renews the vampire genre (something that hasn't been done since Robert Rodrigues' From Dusk Till Dawn) by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel. By saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from it. A lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible. Including the effects which are pretty good for their time. I found the vampire \\\"dustings\\\" to be a very nice touch. In stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies Norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously com-bust which looks great. The fact that the overall effects were well done adds to the credibility of the film which would otherwise have fallen flat on its face.  As previously stated Norrington has a very distinct visual style that sets him apart from the directors of the following Blade movies. Del Toro is nearly as skilled but I prefer Norrington's style. His style gives the film a very special look and feel but most importantly it gives the film atmosphere. A very tense dark atmosphere which works great in tune with the main character and story. Along with the visual style the music which also works fine and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie.  All in all Blade is a very entertaining movie that should probably have had an 8 from me but a few annoying flaws (which cannot be revealed without spoiling the movie, suffice to say, many of them are located near the ending of the film) does that the film must settle with a high 7.  7/10\", \"Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, a half human, half vampire known the daywalker. He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since he teamed up with whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries, but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans (Food as he calls them) and he plans to waken the blood god and take control of the world.  This movie is well cast, written and directed; ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish. Packed with great fight sequences and slick dialogue, Blade is certainly more action than horror, but it definitely delivers.  8/10\", \"If you like horror or action watch this film ASAP. If the opening scene doesn't get your adrenaline pumping then someone should check your pulse. Great Action, excellent casting and top one-liners. This is the only film I have seen in a cinema where the crowd applauded each chop, kick & punch thrown. Not perfection but who cares when films can be this much fun. Its a pure rush of dark comic book action. 9/10\", \"Blade is a fantastic action/thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and Wesley Snipes delivers what I would say to be his best performance yet.  This film has everything that you would ask for in an action/thriller, it has plenty of blood, guts and gore, a twisted, disturbed bad buy, moments of humour but most importantly a very good story line with plenty of twists.  Their is constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects, Wesley Snipes fighting movement is fantastic.  This film is in my opinion a must see, Wesley Snipes cool, solid appearance makes this film and I can't wait for the sequel 'BLADE 2' being released next year.  My IMDB Rating - 9 out of 10\", \"Now here is a movie that does something that hasn't been done in a long time. It take ten or so different elements that we're already familiar with (Vampires, martial arts, a techno beat, top-o-the-line special effects, etc.), and turns it into something that feels brand new. In what could have easily been merely a combination of \\\"Mortal Kombat\\\" and \\\"Buffy: The Vampire Slayer,\\\" Wesley Snipes (no favorite of mine since and mostly because of \\\"Passenger 57\\\") gives a really good turn as the half human/ half bloodsucker. He acknowledges the internal conflict, but doesn't dwell on it more than necessary. He makes Blade as deep a character as Michael Keaton made Batman.  I'll say that the only part of the movie that got me a little miffed was the always present horror movie cliche of that one person that the hero happens to know who happens to know exactly how to stop the evil guy. On the other hand, you sort of have to have that in a movie like this, so it's easily excusable.  Well, Snipes is good. And Steven Dorff, hyped in the previews, makes a more than bad enough bad guy to Snipes' hero. He's got class, presence, and enough control in his little pinky to teach Al Pacino how to tone it down a bit. Who would ever think that a comic book movie would be a launching pad for an actor? I sincerely hope this is. And whoa! where the heck did Kris Kristofferson get acting talent? Don't get me wrong, but the prolific actor hasn't done anything memorable since \\\"Millennium,\\\" and how many of us watched that just 'cause of the cool video box? Well, here he is, folks, in a very Obi-wanish turn, as Blade's mentor and father figure. And good job, too.  The quality of the acting is matched by the quality of the choreography and special effects. Accompanied by a pulsing techno beat, the fight scenes brings back and quickly banish memories of Mortal Kombat. Hey! It had a script, too! I was wondering what had happened to all the good writers out there.  The two major indications to me that I saw a quality flick were these; I had no feeling of remorse about paying full price to get in, a la any Schumacher \\\"Batman,\\\" \\\"The Avengers,\\\" \\\"MK: Annihilation,\\\" \\\"Godzilla,\\\" or \\\"Armageddon.\\\" (wow, how many of those came out this year? Ugh) Also, I look forward to the inevitable sequel, as per the film's ending. Let's just hope they do as good a job with it as with the first one.  \", \"I didn't see this movie until it appeared on television because I was doubtful about comic flicks. Ever since the \\\"Batman\\\" series, \\\"Spawn,\\\" \\\"Judge Dredd,\\\" and many other pitiful p.g.-13 bombs, I dodged everything at all cost. I would question in my mind, \\\"why can't someone make a movie that is rated R and stays true to the story, how difficult is that?\\\" And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade. This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, the good against evil, etc. Yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies, and most of them have bombed. But not Blade, the movie was filmed just right, not going overboard, delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first. Blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks I've seen in a long time.\", \"That snarl...  That scowl...  The acts of random violence...  The gutteral voice...  The fetish wear...  That shaven head...  It can mean only one thing...  GRACE JONES IS BACK!  Actually my sources tell me that the title role in Blade wasn't played by the 1980s diva, but by Wesley Snipes.  All in all this is not an improvement.  Blade is an adaptation of a comic character; somehow in the transfer from the simplistic, two-dimensional world of the printed page it has become even more simplistic and lost a couple of dimensions.  The plot is hackneyed almost beyond belief and adds nothing to the vampire genre, in fact, much like Nosferatu, it seems to suck the life out of the audience. In brief, upwardly mobile vampire wants to become more powerful but is opposed by Blade, half-human, half-vampire, all annoying. It all climaxes with Blade being put in a vampire juice press, some bad martial arts and the most pitiful CGI since 1968.  Blade has to be the least empathic character since Dolph Lundgren's Punisher (also a comic adaptation, perhaps there is a trend here?). Surely the audience is meant to be on the same side as the 'hero'? And whilst a vampire can be a tragic character, this is not true of Blade, he is relentlessly cruel, scornful and not a whole lot better than the bad guys.  I assume that Wesley Snipes has an 'acting' career purely so that everyone else can be compared favourably. As he snarls his way through his movie you find yourself looking for a stake - even a ballpoint pen - anything to put Blade in the grave.   As a piece of narcissism, Blade is pretty much unbeatable - we are treated to endless lingering shots of a gym-fresh Snipes for no reason whatsoever. Likewise no other actor is allowed any chance to give a reasonable performance; the likes of Steven Dorff *CAN* act, but they have to play second fiddle to Snipes' tedious performance.  Kris Kristofferson used to appear in good movies, here he is reduced to a sidekick that you just know isn't going to make it through to the final reel. And what happens when Blade finds out? Yes, you guessed it, he rushes to the scene to wreak his revenge in the villain's giant underground lair.  Why can't world-domination take place in a quiet country house? They always go ahead in underground cathedrals that would have had Albert Speer wondering if they were a little grandiose. A lot of these plans could be stopped right now if local councils paid more attention to plans for extending sub-basements.   The rest of the movie is just as dull and unimaginative with nothing new to add to the genre. Vampires have been done to undeath and perhaps they should be laid to rest for a while - at least until someone can think of some way to make them interesting again.  To finish, there *IS* a Grace Jones vampire movie, it's called Vamp and it's about ten times better than this.\", \"Not like I went in expecting a lot out of it, but I was at least hoping for a fun dumb big budget movie. This isn't even that. This item ranks in the bottom half of all the vampire movies I've ever seen (and believe me, I've seen a lot of them). Bad acting, zero characterization, little to no thought, almost non-existent plot (and that that's there you can drive semi-trucks through the holes in). Sure, it has action and is loud, and has more action, and more noise, and blood, and action... These things alone do not make a good (or even halfway decent) movie. Beats me how some people can say this is the best vampire movie ever made--all I can assume is they haven't seen many. I suggest seeing Near Dark instead.\"], \"review_score\": [9, 8, 9, 10, 7, 10, 10, 9, 9, 10, 8, 10, 10, 7, 9, 8, 9, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 3, 3], \"review_category\": [\"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 8.133333333333333}, \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0229260\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Blood Simple\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0086979\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Bloodmoon\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0118745\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Blow\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0221027\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Body of Evidence\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0106453\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Bridges of Madison County\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0112579\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Bones\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0166110\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"The time is 1979.

Everything about it is good. It has excellent camra work and scary lighting. This was no doubt one of the best horror movies of the year 2001.

I give Bones *** stars out of ****. UNLEASH THE DOGG!\", \"\\\"Bones,\\\" starring Snoop Doggy Dogg and Pam Grier and directed by Ernest Dickerson, is a great horror film with lots of violence and gore.

Here, he plays Jimmy Bones, a gangster who is killed in 1979 and then years later is awakened and out for revenge against the ones who killed him. Think of it as a goofier, more urban version of THE CROW. However, unlike THE CROW this is a good horror movie. Everything you could want in a horror movie is here: plenty of gore, sex, and there's even a scene with a severed talking head! It's actually a lot better then the trailers make it look. **1/2\", \"First of all, I'd like to point out this film features B.S.

Director Ernest Dickerson brings on all your horror clich\\u00e9s, which I don't consider a bad thing, and even slams in some blaxploitation clich\\u00e9s. There were enough references to horror classics to show Dickerson loves the biz-nass he's in. The comic relief in the later half also reminds us (after some darker parts) that this film is not to be taken seriously at all. Snoop delivers as the ghetto \\\"Frank from Hellraiser\\\" or \\\"Jason Voorhees\\\" or \\\"Freddy Krueger\\\" or whatever the f**k. The kids are as believable as you can get with the lines given to them (Lawson and Isabelle look good though). Michael T. Weiss is better than expected as \\\"Loopy-Lou\\\" Lupovich, the crooked cop. Pam Grier is her usual good self as well. But all in all, this truly is Snoop's film. I wish they'd do a franchise on this. After all, the Freddy sequels weren't as successful as the original, but still they made 'em. To me, Jimmy Bones is up there with other boogeymen like Pinhead, Michael Myers and the Candyman.  \\\"The Gangsta of Love don't need no fried chicken!\\\"\", \"I rented this movie thinking that it would be scary and suspensful, but it is totally the opposite! It is dumb and boring, I even almost fell asleep. Don't waste money renting this movie, instead if you see it, throw it in the trash.\", \"This film could have drove it's \\\"point\\\" home a lot better than presented. It should have stayed CLEAR away from the feel of the 70's type \\\"blaxpoitation\\\" films. But this film was not so bad at all.  It tells a story, a story of a big time 70's guy who's soul has not been put to rest. He has a vendetta, dead or not, he needed to see it to its full completion. (Ya know, similar to George W. Bush and his Iraq thing.)  Ernest Dickerson is a darn excellent cinematographer and director of photography. In the 80's I enjoyed his work on \\\"Tales From The Darkside\\\" and I can see he was headed for it here. Trouble is, in feature film, audiences expect more. Progression is the key, and Ernest went for a 70's blaxpoitation thing here instead of just telling the tale as it should be.  Snoop Dog actually did a good job for the material here. If nothing else, this was his audition tape for the feature film: \\\"Starsky and Hutch\\\".  The stereotypical parts for the other actors is what turned me off. (Turned me off in the 70's as well.) which is why this film could have done without it.  But it is an entertaining film. Good for your adult Halloween Party if everyone there is over 35 to recall the movie days of \\\"Foxy Brown\\\", \\\"Blacula\\\" and \\\"Black Cesear\\\".\", \"Quite possible the worst movie every, seriously. Stay away at all cost. I could go on all night why this one is awful, but as a friend to humanity I must warn all; you may want to kill yourself for having viewed this movie in it's entirity. Yes, it just that bad, I mean for God's sake the blood is orange, and that's not even the tip of the ice burg. The movie has no tone, and the little bit of tone it does attemps to establish is ruined by the last 25 min. or so when tries unsuccessfully to switch over to comedy. This movie is bad all the way around the board, there really not one decent thing about it. I refuse to even say anymore about this trash, I dare not give it anymore attention than this. But this is more of a warning just say no.\", \"This movie got so much bad press for featuring Snoop Dogg as it's main villain, not too many people took this film seriously. Yeah the acting in this movie is kinda cheesy but I have seen a lot worse! There are some terrific horror images in this movie. The demonic dog, the wall of screaming soles, lots of nasty bloody death, etc. I caught this movie late one night and got a huge kick out of it! There was a lot of tongue in cheek humor thrown into the movie that kinda killed the horror in some parts. I still had a lot of fun watching this movie. The good far outweighs the bad and to skip out on this movie would be to miss out on a lot of really cool moments. This is the perfect movie for horror fans that like to root for the stalker. The effects in this movie are top notch and the kill scenes are nasty! Now that audiences are more familiar with Snoop Dogg as an actor I think this movie should be given a second chance. A few stupid comedy moments aside, this movie is not that bad, certainly better than \\\" I Know What You Did Last Summer\\\" or \\\" Valentine \\\". If you are a horror B-movie fan and you have not seen this flick yet go rent it now! As for myself, I liked it enough that I am buying the DVD!\", \"I rented this movie not expecting much, and that is a good thing because this film is a real stinker. The overall idea is not very original, which is okay. Some gangster named Jimmy Bones died and is coming back for revenge, or something or another. Plot does not really matter for a movie like this, you just watch and try to enjoy the ride. Now, this is not near close to the worst movie I have seen, I have seen far, far, far worse, but it is also quite far from the best movies. My main gripe with this flick may sound dumb but...pink blood? What is that? The pink blood really takes a lot out of it...it makes it more unrealistic (though not realistic to begin with) and just looks...bad. I have seen $5,000 budgeted films with better looking blood! And other than the pink blood, the movie is just stupid and annoying to me. I say avoid, but some may like it. Worth a rent, I guess, if you want to see a cool pool table death......with pink blood.\", \"I don't think I have ever seen such a terrible movie in my life. Every bit of this movie is horribly acted and well predictable. Who ever gave this movie higher than 2* is an ignorant child, there is absolutely nothing interesting about this movie, except for the gore of course. I don't think that even the most die harder than hard gore fan would be too keen on this waste of film. Mr.Dogg is an ignoramus that does not deserve to be given the privilege of directing, writing, casting etc. If you are smart, you will avoid this movie completely. Save your money, don't rent, buy, or even watch online.  May god help us, thank the lord this movie was made in 2001, and our taste in horror has increased, if you are truly dying to watch a popcorn movie on a late Friday night with the friends, then do yourself a favor and rent 'Valentine', the acting is less bad and the storyline can be accepted. But if you do rent this, I guarantee your wonderful Friday night with your friends and popcorn will go to hell, and they'll leave blaming you.  Good day.\", \"Like the first reviewer here said, this is a mess of a movie.  It's really more of a 70's black exploitation type film than anything else. Not a genre I am a fan of.  I should have known it would stink when Snoop Dogg is the lead. The only rapper I have ever liked in a film was \\\"Ice Cube\\\" in \\\"Ghosts of Mars\\\".\", \"While I can't be certain that Bones went under the studio knife for a little test-screening cosmetic surgery, I sure am suspicious. The first two thirds of the movie deliver old fashioned, 80's-style horror goods with decent character development, a nice history lesson as to why Jimmy Bones is so hacked-off, and some juicy gore. This movie even has a good reason for the heroes to stick around in a haunted house (please, no more horror movies about scientific research groups studying the supernatural). By the time Bones awakens and starts killing those who wronged him, the film has settled into a tight, supernatural revenge flick with a nod to the blaxploitation genre.  Then, oh man, then the film goes horribly wrong. All subtlety flies out the window as the relatively creepy 'hood' setting is replaced with a trip to a \\\"city of dead\\\" that looks like an rejected set from the worst Nightmare on Elm Street movie. What's even worse is that there is no allusion to the \\\"city of the dead\\\" in the entire movie until the scene before our heroes bumble into it.  This glaring shift of setting is made worse by the sudden inclusion of corny, corny attempts a humor--talking decapitated heads complaining about their hair?--and a silly ending. In fact, the last twenty minutes even seem like they were directed by someone else. Imagine watching Se7en, with all its creepy direction and atmosphere, only to have it end like it was directed by Joel Schumacher.   Bones is no Se7en but after a healthy start, it deserved better.  \", \"As a horror film I don't think they come any cheesier. The reason I watched the movie was for a good laugh, and it provided just that. Apparently this type of \\\"horror\\\" scares people. They used disgusting ideas and visions to try to get a scare out of you. For me it just made me laugh. However if you want a good laugh check it out, you wont be let down.\", \"Wow! i just caught this movie on a TV channel. This is absolutely an unmeant masterpiece! The story is as useless as it should be in a decent horror film. In the late 70's Mr Bones does not want to be a dealer, gets killed and goes get revenge 20 years later (for reasons still unknown to men). Ironically the house he is killed in is sold to the kids of one the guys that kills him. He regenerates from having a dog kill people and eat crap and then goes to get revenge on his killers. so far so good, it sounds as a crap horror movie should be.  But having Mr Snoop Dogg playing a pimp in the 70's (in flashback scenes) and a murdering pimp in the 90's is so ridiculously cool it hurts. Even though the whole movie doesn't make ANY sense at any point, it's just cool to see Mr Dogg in a pimp outfit. Also the pun of having two token white kids getting killed in the first minute, the cheesy red colour of the blood, the totally unfitting comic relief of 2 talking heads and all skanky girls in the movie being played by white chicks makes this an absolutely excellent movie! I admit, i have a taste for bad movies. Horrible sci-fi and 80's action movies are a must-see in my opinion, it's cheap laughs! this movie is fitting for that so amazingly i'm getting the DVD tomorrow and organizing a 'movie nite' next week to show this (together with 'Alien Sex Party') to some friends. Hilarity guaranteed! So, get a case of beer, some illegal, mind altering substances and a few good buddies that can appreciate bad movies and have a blast with this Snoop Dogg gem! Oh, and the probably totally unmeant Fatboy Slim homage was the cherry on the cake. A DJ kid wearing sunglasses and a cowboy hat (as does Mr Slim in the 'Rockafeller Skank' video) asks another DJ 'can you do a solo performance, i need some time off right about now, funk soul brother'. Comedy gold, right there.\", \"this movie has a lot of old ideas all mixed into one, yet it doesn't look messy, several teen agers try and open a night club, on \\\"holy ground\\\" without noticing, one of the teenagers finds a girl but her mother is the local \\\"crazy person\\\" they ignore her about this but it was a bad move, when the club is up and running the fun begins, from maggots to wall of dead, its a fun thrill ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat. This movie wasn't one that was supposed to be taken serious, it has snoop dogg so if you came for a serious movie then you are pretty much crazy... It Is a lot of fun to watch, it has a a lot of funny moments, a few sad moments a few scary moments and even some dramatic moments but the main point of the film is to entertain, people are really hard on this film because they expected a masterpiece but if you just want to have a fun time enjoying a movie then this one should do!\", \"Caught this on BET one night. Bones was utterly horrible, but so bad that it was actually funny. And I must say, that while it is a pathetic teen-targeted horror film (and directed even further at Black and probably Hispanic audiences), it was about a zillion times better than most of the pretty white teen \\\"horror\\\" movies I have seen (Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, and all of their nauseating sequels to boot).  This is the story of what I guess was a drug dealer (gee...does Snoop ever do anything different than play a street thug of one sort or another). And his ghost floats around this bizarre, abandoned mansion, that is suddenly claimed by a handful of neighborhood teens who want to turn the pit into a party palace. Bones (Snoop) is terrorizing the people in the house as his ghost floats around in pergatory aiming to take revenge those who stabbed him in a drug deal gone wrong. Why he chose that moment to take his revenge, or why he goes after the teens is unclear. Bone's old woman, played by Pam Grier (a good actress wasted in yet another trashy movie), is psychic and can tell that something bad is brooding in the air.   There was a special effects paradox at work in this film. On the one hand, the production crew goes out of their way with some fantastic, if not innovative, special effects moment (and you need plenty of them with a story so thin as this). And towards the end of the movie, they really take advantage of all of this. On the other hand, for all of the bloodbath scenes, the production crew is very generous with this cheap looking \\\"fake blood,\\\" which is nothing more than bright red paint. How stupid. Actually, the whole movie was pretty stupid. But, at least they did try here and there to do something a little different (both in story elements and special effects), although it was still a bad movie. And, at least it was something you can really laugh at whereas the other movies I mentioned can just really make you homicidal, they're so dreadful (in story and special effects).\", \"Hey, don't you think it's kind of odd that someone would stab themselves in the chest with a flick knife and then bury themselves?   If your answer to the above question is \\\"I agree\\\", then you could have been, or may well be part of the team of monkeys that came up with the idea for, wrote and cast this movie. It's a huge shame that stuff like this gets made when there are screenwriters and directors with good ideas and just need some money. Speaking of money, if you want to waste it; Bones is as good a film as any to waste it on. Well, if you like to waste money and you enjoy pain, that is. Bones is notable for one of the most incredible reasons a film can be notable for, and that is that it stars a rapper. The rapper in question is Snoop Dogg (a.k.a. Dogg, Snoopy, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Snoop and just about every other lame variant of the words 'snoop' and 'dogg' that you can come up with). The tired blend of Hellraiser and rubbish movie starring a rapper see Snoop Dogg get to flex his acting muscles, and he proves with his one-note performance in this movie that he is just as adept at the art of acting as he is at the art of music making. If you catch my drift.  To be quite frank, despite his best efforts to look cool; Snoopy Doggy Dogg ends up looking like just as much of an idiot as his name suggests he is. I mean seriously, who goes by the name of 'Snoop Dogg' when they don't have to? Aside from it's star, this film has a number of other problems. It's plot is very tired, and it follows the exceedingly boring and familiar tale of someone who was killed being resurrected and then taking their revenge. The tacky dialogue, duff acting and illogical plotting don't help this, and not even the murders can save the film, as it's easy to say that even they manage to score maximum points on the dull scale. I will never forgive the people responsible for this movie for wasting all that time and money on it, when it could have been put to better use. How about giving one of the more experienced directors who could produce something good, if given a budget? I guess that's one of the many problems with things like rap music; if it sells, it will continue to be made.\", \"\\\"Bones\\\" was a scarefest that scared up the goods. Director Ernest R. Dickerson's last time he taggled a horror movie was \\\"Tales From The Crypt Presents: Demon Knight.\\\" On \\\"Bones,\\\" he does a better job, but, what I was most impressive from this movie was Snoop Doggy Dogg as Jimmy Bones. He was creepy. There were alot of violence and gore in this movie. But, just the whole movie, from beginning to end, was very good. If you like Snoop Dogg, then you'll love \\\"Bones!\\\"  A+ 13/13 ****** (out of ****** stars)\", \"I thought Bones was okay, and here's why:  The cast are pretty good, the story is simple (but nothing wrong in that), and it makes a change to see a mainstream sort of horror (in the same vein as Scream, or IKWYDLS) with a virtually all black cast - but without resorting, too much, to street-slang and negative stereotypes. There is some flashback in the narrative, but I didn't see this as any attempt at mystery - it's obvious from scene 1 what happened.  On the plus side, the ghost effects were pretty slick - even if the blood was totally unrealistic (like thick paint), and the model/monster effects were only at the Clive Barker level. Which fits with the whole Hellraiser aspect of the movie.  Apart from the paint, my only other quibbles would be the very silly aspect of Snoop's revenge on his two main enemies (more like a comedy sketch), and the way Pam Grier COULD have just got naked to save the day (dammit!)  Yes, the film could have been so much more (scarier, longer and deadlier for three things), but I still enjoyed it, If nothing else, I spent a good 20 minutes chuckling at the outrageous design of the house, and I don't remember 'Kendra' being nearly so beautiful.\", \"SPOILER CONTAINED  I can't see why everyone is complaining about this movie. The plot was a little weak, but it's a horror movie. say that to yourself while you watch it and you won't hate it so much. Think about it. there is a very small fraction of horror movies made that have 'good movie' components. plus, snoop dogg is in this. that's the first reason to watch it. i realize this doesn't sound like a sound argument to you people that think Traffic was a good movie, but get a life, loosen up, and watch horror movies with the expectation that they'll live up to the legacy of The Horror Movie, not some brainy flick that people superficially latch on to becuase they don't understand it.  anyway, Bones was a good horror movie because it did the job of a series of movies in one installment. usually if there is a lapse in time it's between moves and not in them.   ***SPOILER*** I also appreciate how he is never vanquished by the end of the movie. It's a plot twist that is not often used. ***END***  if you liked this go rent Killer Klowns from Outer Space\", \"This was a very good film if you dig any of the \\\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\\" series (preferably Parts 3 or 4). You can see it has that Freddy Krueger vibe running through its veins. Right down to the colorful shadows, neato killings, and anti-hero villain. But it also stands on its own much more than some similiar Nightmare knockoffs (Leprechaun comes to mind, in fact this film plays like a much more effective Leprechaun 4: Lep in the Hood).  Snoop Dogg does very well in the role of Bones, making lines like, \\\"The Gangster of Love don't need no fried chicken\\\" sound very serious and convincing. Pam Grier once again returns to her roots and I for one am not complaining. Maybe I'm slightly partial to this film because it features Katharine Isabelle from one of my favorite horror films \\\"Ginger Snaps\\\". But beyond that I very enjoyed this ride of movie.\", \"An attempt to make a modern-dress Gothic melodrama that is just not successful. Ernest Dickerson has a good grasp of the iconography of horror films, but he can't put them together well enough to make a good scary movie. He borrows concepts and images liberally from Clive Barker, Dario Argento, and Mario Bava - but all it shows is that he's a good copycat, not that he's a good stylist. From the idea of evil reviving itself by consuming a victim (Barker's \\\"Hellraiser\\\", but cinematic ally dating at least back to Hammer's \\\"Dracula, Prince of Darkness\\\" from 1965), thru the rain of maggots (Argento's magisterial \\\"Suspiria\\\"), to the disembodied hand reaching out of the darkness to torment the dead man's lover (Bava's masterpiece, \\\"Whip and the Body\\\"), there really is nothing here that we haven't seen before and better. The conceit of setting it in a ghetto with an all-black cast promises an interesting variation on your basic \\\"revenge from beyond the grave\\\" scenario, but beyond the music and fashions it's still a pretty clich\\u00e9d film. One of the problems is that Dickerson just can't seem to leave well enough alone - like the maggot scene. OK, it's raining maggots and it's terrifying, we get it already, is it really necessary to go for the gross-out by showing people EATING them? Or the scene where Maurice is killed - again, the dog-spirit eats Maurice to give form and substance to Bones' cadaver, we get it, it's not necessary to linger on the details of the chow-down. It's never scary - just disgusting. Even his attempts to inject humor are forced and heavy-handed, with the idiotic scenes of Bones carrying the heads of his victims and having them carry on an interminably pointless conversation. And again, he doesn't show it to us once, there's at least three long scenes with the chatty heads so whatever humor there was is pounded into unconsciousness thru repetition. But the most glaring problem with this movie is that we are asked to sympathize with a character who is, at bottom, just as big a bad guy in life as the crack dealers who murder him. Dickerson tries to show us Bones as the protector of his 'hood, but come on - he's exploiting his people just as much with his numbers game, or did it never occur to anyone to ask how Bones got the money for his supah-dupah fly crib when everyone else around him lives in complete poverty? For a MUCH better horror movie that reflects the black urban experience, rent \\\"Tales from the Hood\\\" instead.\", \"I've read the other comment referring to Snoop Doggs'horror film, Bones....When this first came out it was my favourite horror film but I watched it that many times that it lost its' lustre.  The effects are great and plenty of blood and some gore from the outset. The beginning sets the tone for the rest of the film as it's one of those films that you just NEED to get to the bottom of why it is happening and what actually took place to cause it. It all unfolds at a pace enough to keep your interest as a viewer. This film is still a very watchable and enjoyable film in my opinion, even today.   It was nice to see Snoop in something different and anyone that is a Snoop Fan will enjoy this film all the more.....7 out of 10.\", \"I only recently saw this movie. Basically your standard man gets killed and sometime later comes back to life to get his revenge on his killers. It starts with potential and kept it through about 3 quarters of the film but in the last quarter it choked, stalled, and then died.  All through the movie the blood was any color but the color of blood, I have to wonder if that was supposed to have paid homage to the days when the censorship laws prohibited film makers using blood colored blood, it does in its own way add a kind of sick humor to Bones and there was plenty of dark humor to go around in the first place, really there are parts that are quite funny. Unfortunately there are also parts that are just plain stupid and other parts that are gross just for the sake of being gross. It also has plenty of things that are clich\\u00e9 then there is the racially clich\\u00e9. A black man has a white lover called Snowflake and a joke about eating fried chicken among other things.  Getting closer to the end the story begins to follow an illogical line, if Jimmy Bones returns from the dead to seek revenge on those that killed him then why did he do so much more damage and why did the movie end the way it did? So that the film makers could get the movie done and leave an opening for a sequel to a movie that never needed one?  I think that the greatest injustice of the movie was that the character of Jimmy Bones was made into the bad guy, vicious and ruthless and completely the opposite of what and who the character was made out to be during flashback scenes that occur throughout the film. Even though this happens Snoop Dogg gives a great performance as Jimmy Bones but the writing of the character and the movie itself could have been handled better, both had potential that was dropped and ended before the full potential was ever reached. Still the movie is fun and that makes it very watchable even if you watch it just the once.\", \"The entire concept is great. This movie in no way is horrible, but its not actually a movie in the first place. Instead, it's more of a comedy. It follows along the lines of Snoop Dog entering a room, his adversary saying the clich\\u00e9 of, \\\"no! I'm sorry!,\\\" or, \\\"Bones!\\\" (shocked expression). I have got to say that Bones is first-rate comedy. It would be what Troll 2 would have been like if Busta Rhymes and Ice-T were cast.  I ask you, however, what is greater than the concept of Evil Snoop Dogg coming back to earth to feast on human flesh, and wreak vengeance on those who betrayed him. Sure, it's been done in 50% of movies, but at least watch it for its absolute corniness.  By the way, when Snoop was floating across the room with those eyes, I was rolling on the floor. I didn't see the ending, but it probably involves Snoop Dogg unleashing his rap zombies on the world, and feasting on the living, ending Civilization once and for all.\", \"Ahh... the midnight horror movie. Cheesy, silly, and not in the slighest bit scary, its sole purpose is to provide a cheap thrill or induce sleep. As anyone who's read any of my other reviews can see, I like cheap thrills just as much as a good movie, and although Bones certainly was cheap, cheesy, silly, and not in the slightest bit scary, I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd thought I would.  The reasoning for this is that Bones is exactly like any other direct-to-video, midnight cable fare, only at theatrical release, midday pay-per-view pricing. The reason I like other cheap films so much is because they are just that - cheap. I'm biased; I expect a lot more from a movie that I shell out $9 for in a theatre than a $2 5-day rental.  In 1979, Jimmy Bones (Snoop Dogg!) is your friendly neighborhood numbers-runner. A crooked cop, a drug dealer, and his business associate try to convince him to bring crack to the hood. Bones is a numbers-runner with morals and a love for his people, and won't allow it. The business meeting ends with his murder.  In 2001, the neighborhood has gone to hell, especially Bones' old mansion, which is currently haunted by a big black dog with blood-red eyes. A group of teen wanna-be DJ's (who also just happen to be the children of Bones' old associate) decide to fix up the mansion and turn it into a happening nightclub. They discover Bones' skeleton buried in the basement, and a stray dog, whom they name Bones (how original!). This dog just happens to be the same killer incarnation of Jimmy Bones' ghost, and every life he takes adds life to the bones in the basement, until Jimmy is resurrected from the dead, and he sure is angry!  This film, equal parts horror, comedy and blaxploitation, begs you not to take it seriously. If you do, like most films of this type, you'll notice the atrocious acting and cheap special effects. If not, however, you'll be intrigued by bleeding pool tables, talking severed heads, and a climax in the \\\"city of the dead\\\", that is actually well done and far surpasses the rest of the film. Unfortunately, it lacks the campy \\\"charm\\\" of any of the above mentioned three genres.  I knew from the trailers and movie posters not to take this movie seriously. Even taking it as nonseriously as I could, I just couldn't enjoy it; it's a lowbrow wolf of a film trying to pass itself off in theatrical sheep's clothing. Honestly, if I had found this on the back shelf of some cheap video store I would've loved it. In a theatre, I just expect more from films.\", \"I watched this with my roommate Saturday night and I must admit that it had me on the edge of my seat, until the very end. The special effects and camera work is very impressive. It is what it is, a fun movie that has some redeeming qualities. Believe me, I've seen worse and some that weren't this fun. This is definately not a keeper but it should be viewed once.\", \"I heard this movie sucked. It did not. It is not great film, but it is good film. The homage to the 1970s was there, the little \\\"film buff\\\" touches that remind one of urban horror's roots as far back as nosferatu.  this movie could easily have been a sell out, with Bones as \\\"Snoop da CROW\\\"  with the vengeance thing, but it did not.  the only \\\"bad horror\\\" gimmick was the last 4 seconds of the film.  I expected a crappy horror movie. This beats urban legend or scream 3.  \", \"This movie is not the worst of horror movies that I have seen, however it is far from the best also. This movie has some pretty decent special effects, and doesn't have a bad story line. Who better to play a drug pusher in the 70's than Snoop Dogg. Snoop is not the best actor in the world but does show a better job in this movie than previous movies. 7 out of 10 stars. Not great, but not bad.\", \"I was doubtful about this movie when I went to the cinema to watch it last weekend, but after having watched it I reinforce my good opinion about the products made by New Line Cinema. The film is very well done but apart from that, I think it shouldn\\u00b4t disappoint any fan of horror, it has everything that a good movie of the genre must have, including great amounts of blood, a very good rhythm and effective actors such as Pam Grier(Jackie Brown), the muse of blaxploitation genre from the seventies, a genre which is paid homage in this movie as well as some classics of the genre such as \\\"Hellraiser\\\" or \\\"Reanimator\\\", although the introduction of the comic element paying homage to that movie was for me the weakest element of the whole(it broke the so tenebrous atmosphere).Finally, director Ernst. R.Dickerson who also directed the not so good but entertaining \\\"tales from the Crypt: Evil Knight\\\" assured that this movie had elements from Italian horror cinema, I don\\u00b4t know but perhaps there is one: The warms.A homage to Lucio Fulci?, I know there is many homages here but it is the same for other movies and the cocktail is far from being so effectively combined as here.I don\\u00b4t think they are going to make a sequel, but I am looking forward eagerly the next movie from this director and I wish \\\"Resident Evil\\\" was so satisfactory.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Bound\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0115736\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Bourne Identity\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0258463\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Brazil\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0088846\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Bringing Out the Dead\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0163988\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Broadcast News\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0092699\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 30, \"review_content\": [\"I was completely drawn into the story, but I wonder if perhaps I shouldn't have been so sympathetic to the Hurt character's plight for respect.

Whatever anyone thinks of \\\"Broadcast News,\\\" good or bad, almost all the credit for that \\\"thinking\\\" belongs to writer-producer-director James L. Brooks. As a screenwriter (of which he has long been one of the best), it is not easy to savage an entire business -- in this case, the \\\"business\\\" being television news -- but to do it with a smile, a wink, a knowing nod and a laugh practically every step of the way. To do all that takes real talent, something Mr. J. Brooks has in abundance.  One user on this website, in his summary, asked the musical question -- \\\"Did Walter Cronkite act like this?\\\" Answerve: No! Of course not! And the reason for that is in Walter's -- uh, Mr. Cronkite's -- day, the only thing that mattered was bringing the news to the people. Same goes for John Chancellor and Chet and David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Smith. Sure, they had to pay lip-service attention to their ratings, if only to please their bosses. But all they REALLY cared about was THE NEWS ITSELF.  Now, of course, all that has changed. For the last 25-30 years in the network news business, the only thing that has really mattered is ratings, ratings, ratings. The bottom line. How many bucks will our news division deliver for the network? Don't believe that?  Let's consider \\\"The Big Three\\\": Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings (aka \\\"Stanley Stunning\\\"). All three have now been on the job at their respective anchor desks for the last 15-20 years (Peter actually got his first shot at the national anchor desk way back in the 1960s but was totally unprepared for the job). Of the three, Dan is the one with the greatest in-the-field training as a reporter. Personally, I think all three do terrific jobs as news anchors and are deserving of their positions. All of which has nothing to do with why all three are actually IN those jobs. All three are now in their 60's (Dan is pushing the big 7-0) and all three are still very good looking. And if you think they're still good looking now, imagine how good looking they were in their 40's, when all three were hired for (let's say, \\\"put in\\\") their current jobs. But do you honestly believe that any one of these three would have been \\\"put in\\\" had he looked like, let's say, Fred Gwynne (\\\"Herman Munster\\\"). Or like -- heaven forfend -- ME!!! Not only that, if Dan were retiring tomorrow, a younger (than he is today) Walter Cronkite would not be able to get his old job back. Why? Not pretty enough. And it would matter not a whit that he is, or once was, \\\"the most trusted man in America.\\\"   And this is what \\\"Broadcast News\\\" is all about. Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), the next pretty-boy-national-news-anchor-to-be who has trouble with a few minor things, such as thinking for himself, being able to write and knowing stuff. Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the brilliant news producer with news business standards and ethics, all of which get thrown to the wind when even she falls for pretty-boy-Tom. And Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks, no relation to James L.), a top-notch newswriter and field reporter who has no hope for a national job because he \\\"flop-sweats\\\" behind the anchor desk. And many other such flawed characters whom you KNOW really do exist in the news divisions of the various networks.  \\\"Network\\\" blazed the trail. Eleven years later, \\\"Broadcast News\\\" carried the torch as a worthy successor. In the new millennium, what will be the next movie to savage the business of network \\\"news you can use\\\" ..... maybe. Or maybe not.\", \"Spoiler Alert   I have never seen comments on a movie, that I disagree with more then the comments people made on this. One could learn from critical viewings of this movie. As an educational film, I rate it highly because it teaches \\\"how to succeed\\\"! We do not watch movies to learn; we generally watch for entertainment. As entertainment, I rate it low: the ending is downbeat and cerebral/intellectual. This conflict results in my eight star rating. The movie follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. The network executive introduces Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), to study for the on air news anchor position. Tom immediately charms people with humbleness. Another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his on air opportunity, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all news stories, inside and out.  The Network executive wants Grunnick on the air and Jane argues, saying Grunnick is not ready, he doesn't know the news. They do not listen to her. Forced to place Grunnick on the air, Jane contacts Altman to get information on the news story and relays Altman's comments through an earpiece to Grunnick while Grunnick speaks. We watch the sharp contrast between Altman's/Jane Craig's words and Grunnick's, as Grunnick skillfully rewords everything Altman and Jane Craig say in his ear, in order to make it understandable, likable and entertaining the audience. Altman gets a chance on air and the network execs require him to seek coaching from Grunnick, the new guy. This new (news ingnorant) guy coaching him? This is something Altman does not see justified, but agrees reluctantly.   Grunnick coaches Altman and gets excited noting hundreds of Altman's shortcomings in appearance, audio and vocabulary. Altman never considered these things before, when he became an expert on the news itself. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him, causes Altman to have a panicked sweating attack (\\\"Flop Sweat\\\") when he is on the air. Grunnick eventually becomes the top network anchor and Altman resigns prior to being fired. But Grunnick fails in his attempt for a romance with Jane Craig, because she finds out from Altman, that Grunnick sometimes fakes circumstances in order to make people like him. This turns her off of him. This sends the message that in relationships, we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them.   This movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job, but it is especially true in Broadcast News. There are many people commenting on how this is the dumbing down of TV News and how Grunnick represents a good looking, but dumb guy or all style, but no substance. The opposite is true, Grunnick possessed skills and very complex intellect, to get people to like him, including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds, when he is on camera (He coaches Altman to Punch a word in every sentence). Grunnick's flaw that costs him the relationship with Jane Craig, is that he is too driven to be likable and will fake a situation. Many people are calling Altman very intelligent or brilliant. Altman played by Brookes is not as intelligent as Grunnick and the \\\"Flop Sweat\\\" scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that Grunnick handles when on the air. Altman is angered by this fact that he knew the news and Grunnick suceeded more by getting people to like him. There are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the TV News industry. The concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job, is obviously, not popular, but my experience indicates it is true in most jobs. As an education on how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, albeit unpopular. Educational, yes, but it does not have an uplifting ending.\", \"This movie has everything going for it: Fully developed characters, a realistic portrayal of working Washington, bathed in warmth and humor that is uniquely Albert Brooks. The dumbing down of network news is even more of an issue now than it was in 1987. Remember, this was pre-cable! So satisfying to care about complex people attempting to achieve complex goals -- and it all moves along with lightning speed. Such a true to life depiction of friendships that teeter toward romance. See if you can spot John Cusack as the angry messenger! And do you recognize Peter Hackes from real life Broadcast News? Finally, if you're from DC, see if you agree with Holly Hunter's directions to cab drivers!\", \"I loved this movie the first time I saw it. It gives such detail of what executives involved in the news industry will do just to get a story on the air: notably Jane Craig rushing Kenny to finish editing the piece to get it off, and then Joan Cusack struggling to get it in, and William Hurt, who according to Jane commits an incredible breach of ethics, fakes his tears during his date rape interview, a flaw that is pointed out by Aaron. Another high point is when Tom uses Jane for his own benefits, and then turns around and sleeps with Jennifer. The script is brilliant, and the directing is almost as good. All three main actors were great in the portrayals of their characters, Especially Holly Hunter, and Albert Brooks, whom is the funniest in the film. William Hurt is also very good. This deserved at least three Oscars, best actress(holly hunter), best supporting actor (Albert Brooks), and best picture. I liked the last parts of the film where it shows them reuniting 7 years later.  8/10\", \"A truly terrific, touching film. Female melodrama at its finest, with a lot of comedy: great dialogue, characters and writing. Any woman can relate to the story because it's a classic: you're in love with \\\"Mr. Right\\\" but he has no interest in you until some guy who seems completely wrong comes along and you fall head-over-heels in love. But of course, it's not that simplistic. The characters are real and all of the performances are perfect. The movie is hilarious as well, every scene skewers society. I'd recommend this film to anyone who loves a well-written screenplay of humor and melodrama. You can relate to every character and the plot moves in unexpected directions. A great, underrated movie.\", \"Movie watchers often say great movies must have 3 memorable  scenes to be considered truly great. Broadcast news doesn't have  three, it has twice that. This movie is extremely well written by  James Brooks. Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have never been  better. I love this movie for many reasons. It is great because it  makes you laugh and it makes you cry. Albert Brooks has several  great lines and many unforgettable scenes: # 1(laughed) \\\"I can  sing and read, I am singing while I read,\\\" with Midnight Train to  Georgia playing in the background. # 2(laughed) Telling the  William Hurt character that \\\"You really blew the lid off of nookie,\\\"  after watching Hurt's report on date-rape. #3 (Cried) When Aaron  (A. Brooks) finally tells Jayne (Hunter) that he loves her and she  can't end up with Hurt's character because he represents  everything about journalism Jayne finds dispicable. Finally, #4 (laughed) who can forget the scene where Aaron  anchors the weekend news....hilarious. This movie should have won an Oscar! It has everything I love in  movies, great acting, intelligent script, and even a Jack Nicholson  cameo!\", \"Typically, I'm a comedy guy. I rented this at the video store under comedy, and thought \\\"Albert Brooks! Awesome!\\\" and rented it. It seemed like the romantic comedy, and I remembered I hated those, and had the full mindset of hating this movie.  Boy, was I wrong.  While this is a romantic comedy, it's acted by an amazing lead & supporting cast (Brooks, Hunter, Cusack, and Nicholson), and everything works well within itself. The script sounds real and not forced, like this could be happening in the news station you're watching at night. It takes your emotions and makes you enjoy Hunter and Brooks and loathe Hurt, which makes the ending a bit unenjoyable and fruitless, but it shows how you don't need a happy ending to end a movie, you just need a truthful ending, which is what everyone got. Not everybody's life ends well, and it shows in Broadcast News. Maybe people don't like the ending because it's not your typical happy ending associated with romantic comedies... but it works, it's real, and it's genius. Broadcast News is a classic in it's time, and a fine romance movie up there with \\\"Casablanca\\\". Well, maybe not that high, but it's the only other romance I can think of that I like.  Broadcast News: 9/10.\", \"I didn't like \\\"As Good as it Gets\\\" very much, but I am a big fan of William Hurt and Holly Hunter's work, so I decided to watch this movie. And the most surprising thing for me was the superb work of Albert Brooks. Here, in Spain, he's little-known, and only as a 2nd division version of Woody Allen in the West Coast. He played a great part, but Hunter and Hurt were good too, specially Hurt, in an relatively unusual role for him. Hunter played the role that reminds me a bit of her part in \\\"Once Around\\\" (Lasse Hallstrom, 1991).  Finally, the rest of the cast is great, too. Robert Prosky, one of these familiar faces of the american cinema, the ex-bond girl Lois Chiles, pretty good placed on that role, I think, the always perfect Joan Cusack in her early years; and specially the brief appereance of Jack Nicholson. Maybe he doesn't have any good scene, but it's Jack Nicholson, anyway... The Best movie by James L.Brooks, great story (well resolved), and superb cast for one of the, surely, best movies of the 80's\", \"I haven't actually seen a lot of movies with Holly Hunter, but seeing her in Broadcast News was a pleasant surprise. She is a hard-nosed journalist, Jane Craig, who has devoted all of her time to TV news show. Her colleague Aaron Altman has carried her torch for a long time without saying anything. The love triangle is completed by Tom Grunnick. He is the slightly aloof ex-sportscaster who is the new reporter. To Jane, he symbolizes everything she doesn't like about news reporting - turning it into edutainment, not serious business. Much to her surprise, Jane finds herself attracted to Tom.  Holly Hunter is doing a great performance as the perky journalist. But I don't quite see what she finds so charming about her new colleague, Tom. It's something with them that prevents us from getting up close and personal with him. Almost as impressive is Albert Brooks, who gives his all in the role of a professional who gives more than 100 percent for his job but doesn't get quite as much in return. Actually, for a while I thought he was Steve Guttenberg from Police Academy (1984). He has a few funny lines and if this was a Meg Ryan-picture, they'd call it a romantic comedy.  Running over two hours, a few scenes could have been edited or left out completely, eg. Jane's and Aaron's trip to Central America. Also, I'm a sucker for happy endings and had preferred a different ending than just a reunion between the three of them seven years later.\", \"Not only do I think this was the best film of 1987, it's probably in my own amorphous list as one of the 10-20 best films I've ever seen. For whatever reason, I really connected with this movie, and it is one of the most personal films I had seen at that point in my life (I was 26). For better or worse, I strongly identified with the Holly Hunter character (and I'm a guy!). She plays an extremely bright, loyal and intense woman who couldn't figure out romantic relationships. There were so many things that she said in this movie that were things that I would say or have said to others in similar circumstances. And the ending of the movie I find to be so very, very sad.  Obviously, this role was the big break for Holly Hunter. Clearly, I was not the only one to think so highly of it.\", \"This is a love story set against the back drop of television news. The three main stars, William Hurt,Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks create a love triangle whilst working at the Washington bureau of a TV network.  Tom Grunick(Hurt)is the handsome reporter who is being groomed to be a star.Jane (Hunter)is the producer who recognises that Tom lacks the intellectual gravitas to be a real journalist, but falls for him anyway.Aaron Altman(Brooks)is the man who shares her beliefs in journalistic standards is also the man who truly loves her.  Holly Hunter was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award ,but lost out to Cher(Moonstruck!).She was robbed! This is Hunter's film.Her character Jane is smart,ruthless and totally driven. She is also hilariously neurotic. Her performance is perfect.Just watch her face when she watches the tape of Tom's interview of a rape victim. The scales literally fall from her eyes.  Wiliam Hurt's performance is less showy.He plays a man who is well aware that he is a himbo and a fraud,but is smart enough to know that his rise will be facilitated by people like Jane.He gives little hints of a man who is extremely calculating.  The film comments on celebrity, journalism,integrity and the commercial pressures on news in a medium that is focused on the bottom line. It predicted that news would be dumbed down, that standards would slowly be lowered due to commercial pressures.  Think about this:this film was released before the end of the Cold War and before rise of reality TV.Yet, it predicted the dumbing down of the news.Paris Hilton's release from jail was treated like a major news story! To see how prophetic this film is,just watch your evening news and note the set, the graphics and the presenters.Tom Grunick and his clones are well and truly alive!\", \"i thought it was terrific! very realistic and funny dialogue, and realistic action in a newsroom. i didn't like how the jennifer storyline is not really concluded or how the ending doesn't give us closure. holly hunter fit the part perfectly...she's one crazy actress. this movie is well worth seeing.\", \"TV News producer, Jane Craig (Hunter) meets Tom Grunick (Hurt), an up-and-coming news presenter, at a seminar, and their mutual attraction takes them back to her room. Romance, however, is cut short, when it emerges that Tom is, in his own words, \\\"no good at what I'm being a success at\\\", and Jane realises he personifies everything she hates about where TV news is going. The rub comes when Tom reveals he is about to join her news bureau in Washington.  Jane and Tom's initial attraction is therefore given a second chance, but will Jane be able to put aside her professional opinion of the man she finds herself attracted to - and should she? Aaron Altman (Brooks) is Jane's highly intelligent reporter colleague and confidante. Despite his obvious talent, Aaron's career is stalling as he lacks the confidence and people skills - and the classic good looks - to be the success that his new, less qualified and less intelligent colleague - Tom - is becoming. He is also concerned that his good friend Jane maybe falling in love with Tom, despite her better judgement, as it becomes increasingly clear that Aaron has his own romantic feelings for her.  This central romantic plot is set within the trials and tribulations of a TV news network office, where moral dilemmas and ethics are wrestled with quickly and where appearances and dramatic effect are becoming more prevalent and important.  This is where most of the bite comes from with well-observed comment and scenes. One of many moments is a scene where Tom meets the Network's top anchorman, Bill Rorich (a cameo role for Jack Nicholson), for the first time, and the camera focuses on their handshake. In a film full of great lines and dialogue, long and short, you realise a lot about these two men's character from this one quick shot of two hands.  The dialogue between characters is amongst the most intelligent and witty you are ever likely to find anywhere on film and in such abundance. Brooks gets the best portion of them, in line with his character, but even the briefest conversations that are incidental and perhaps over-heard by one or more of the characters as they move through a crowded room, should be listened to.  Hunter is a tour-de-force in this role for which she was rightly (and not alone) nominated for an Oscar, and for which she probably would have got if it was for a role in a film that didn't mock part of what had become a closely related industry - and against a strong performance from another actress in a more traditional feel-good, rom-com.  Brooks is also excellent as the constantly frustrated and occasionally too-smug-for-his-own-good, Aaron Altman.  Hurt, whilst possessing the looks and providing the personality required of his character, does not always convince that he is quite as dim-witted the character says he is or is supposed to be. He displays a latent intelligence that enables him to make the most of his apparent limitations, which may be plausible, but I don't think Hurt quite pulls it off. Apart from when he tells us he \\\"stinks\\\" or \\\"doesn't get it\\\", Hurt comes across as a bit smarter than that. Otherwise it is an effective performance, in a role where his character is compromised by its intellectual limitations, but Brooks and Hunter slightly overshadow Hurt's performance. It is the only negative thing I can say about the whole film, and who is to say that anyone else would have done it better, or come off any better, when next to Hunter and Brooks and their performances in this movie.  Support is ably provided by, amongst others, Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles and Joan Cusack, and there is also a bit-part role for Christian Clemenson of subsequent Boston Legal fame, and the briefest of bit-parts for Joan's brother, John Cusack, whose face you don't even see.  James L Brooks has provided us with many great TV shows and movies, and this film should rank up there with the very best of them. It may not have won any Oscars, despite seven nominations, but it did win plenty of other awards, and turned Holly Hunter into a star.\", \"I don't really know when it was that TV stations began preferring to have handsome men as their reporters - regardless of the mens' IQs - but it was clearly a problem by the time that \\\"Broadcast News\\\" came out, and the movie does a really good job looking at it. Portraying a love triangle between pretty boy air-head reporter Tom Grunick (William Hurt), intelligent but nervous reporter Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) and producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the movie pulls no punches. Probably the best line in the movie is when Tom says something like: \\\"I don't really understand any of what I'm reporting.\\\" And in the era of FOX News and such things, a movie like this becomes even more important.  All in all, definitely a movie that I recommend. Also starring Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack, and Jack Nicholson in a supporting role as the anchorman.\", \"If you have not seen this late 80s film about the the Washington Bureau of a Network News station than I highly recommend it. It is a sad commentary on the direction of news reporting in this country but tells the story with wit. The characters are well developed and Albert Brooks performance is fabulous. He delivers all his lines with entertaining understated comedy. I am not an Albert Brooks fan at all so this was a welcome surprise. I have a friend who works as a producer for a local news station and he advised that this is close to reality so kudos to the films writer and director for doing their research.  Fun movie with a lot of insight into the World of Network News. It is not nearly as dark as another movie I also recommend in the same genre 'Network'.\", \"...there was \\\"Broadcast News,\\\" and what a good thing it was. This one just plain stands up and sounds its barbaric yawp in a manner that resonates two decades later.  There are moments -- especially with respect to the cutesy score -- when this film becomes a bit too eighties, or a bit too \\\"Sleepless in Seattle.\\\" Fortunately, they're few and far between.  One-third social satire, one-third romantic comedy, one-third drama, with three flawed but endearing people at its core, it's smart and moving and almost impossibly funny. Holly Hunter in particular may never have been more fun to watch in a comedic role. (And yes, I'm including \\\"Raising Arizona,\\\" her other star turn from that era, in this assessment.)  A legitimate classic.\", \"Good drama/comedy, with two good performances from Hunter & Hurt, but Albert Brooks steals every scene he is in. With a great script, this movie soars and gives everyone a chance to show their acting talent. And although Joan Cusack is not in this much, but she has one if not the funniest scene in the movie. The highlight of the movie for me, was Albert Brooks speech on the devil. Only one draw back is the fact it goes little slow in places. And I only got totally interested in Brooks role, not so much in Hunter's or Hurt's. I give this a 7 out of 10.\", \"Broadcast News {dir. James L. Brooks, 1987}   ****/****   Although it lacks the emotional punch of Brooks's debut feature, (Terms of Endearment) Broadcast News is a superlative film, with exceptional performances from each of the three leads and a script that feels as genuine and well-researched as a hard-hitting news report. Let it be known, this is a character film first and foremost and a satire second. In my mind it succeeds on both levels on its own terms. The film's characters are given surprising depth and dimension , while the satire remains sly and never bitter. Comparisons to Network are unnecessary because the films have two completely separate goals and attitudes. While also a great film, Network is a cynical and weary work; in other words, its mad as hell and fed up with the state of television. Network's style of satire feels more extreme and guerrilla. In contrast, the characters populating the news rooms of Broadcast News love and live for their jobs (sometimes to the detriment of their love lives.) They derive pleasure from the stresses and satisfactions of news reporting, just as the audience derives pleasure from watching this sweet and romantically realistic masterpiece.\", \"Spunky journalist Holly Hunter produces investigative news reports for a major news network. She's a motor-mouthed maverick, dazzlingly good at her job and with little time for romantic relationships. Enter William Hurt and Albert Brooks, two men who vie for her love.  Brooks is an old school journalist who adores Holly because she represents everything good about journalism. They both believe that the media exists to test the Gods, educate the public and fight for truth. Children of the sixties, they embody hippie values. They're defenders of the public good. Knights who fight valiantly with pen and camera.  William Hurt, in contrast, is a far more complex character. Initially awkward, clumsy and self-depreciating, he gradually reveals himself to be a sexy and manipulative high achiever, skilled at climbing the corporate ladder. Unlike Holly and Brooks, he's symbolic of modern media values: news as spectacle, journalism as entertainment, news anchor as celebrity, truth as subject to editing board. We want to despise him and his blip-time junk food journalism, but we just can't quite manage it. He's playing the game by its own rules. Do we condemn him for lacking a moral backbone? Do we condemn the game? Can the game exist if its rules are disobeyed? How have these rules evolved?   This isn't Lumet's and Chayefsky's \\\"Network\\\", and so the film never bothers to answer or raise these questions. Content to keep things on the level of light comedy, it ends with Hurt being promoted to London Division and Brooks being booted to a tiny community network. Holly, having rejected both men, remains caught between them. The last bastion of media integrity, this spunky reporter remembers her roots, mourns the loss of Brooks and warns herself to be on the guard of future William Hurts.  It's a cute ending, but compared to \\\"Network\\\" the film seems positively trite. Chayefsky's vision is one in which global media, despite its ubiquity, offers less meaningful information. He foresees a world in which globalisation has homogenized cultures, information has become subject to corporatisation and a handful of media monopolies control all international news. This is a world in which the truth is subject to shareholder meetings and economic interests. A world in which viewer ratings determine content and opinion polls dictate top stories.   Perhaps this is why \\\"Broadcast News\\\", which longs for the glory days of journalism, ends on such a bittersweet note. It knows what the future holds. Made in 1987, its been living it for at least a decade.  But today, in the digital age, things are even worse. Mergers and acquisitions have left a very small number of massive firms dominating the communication landscape. With this has come the hyper-commercialism of content, the barrier between the creative/editorial side and the commercial side all but collapsed. Today everyone might be able to start their own blog or website, but these are grass roots affairs. As the communication reach of the individual increases (due to technological progress - email, internet, electricity, air mail etc) the size of the individual's world increases likewise. He must project his voice both further and louder, futilely battling that deafening white noise, the incessant verbal static that is the global community.  So ultimately you need two things according to democratic theory. Firstly, you need a rigorous coming of people in power and people who want to be in power, both in the private and public sector. Secondly, you need a wide range of informed opinions on all important issues of the day. In a democratic society the media system as a whole should produce this sort of culture. Unfortunately, the structure we currently have in the global system works directly against the needs of democratic journalism and a democratic society.   8/10 \\u0096 This is lightweight stuff, but a witty script, some funny moments and a brief cameo by Jack Nicholson, elevate it above most other films about journalism. Interestingly, unlike most films about the media, it never dips into satire, and instead plays things as a straight love triangle.  Worth one viewing.\", \"BROADCAST NEWS opens with a series of brief vignettes that are a clever way of starting a story about TV anchors who have no clue as to what they're reporting about.  At a speech before a group of would-be reporters, all of whom are bored by her presentation, most of them leave. When the last one exits, the co-host of the event says quietly to HOLLY HUNTER: \\\"I don't think there will be any Q&A.\\\" Subtle line in a brilliantly written low-key comedy, a farce about the show biz aspect of TV anchoring.  WILLIAM HURT is the inept news anchor who finds himself working with HOLLY HUNTER as the network anchorman. Hurt badly needs help in remedial reporting and Holly refuses to take the bait--at first. He knows he's only capable of looking good, but is not a reporter. He proves to be a quick study as long as his earpiece is working and he's getting all the straight info from executive producer Hunter.  Holly's other anchor friend (ALBERT BROOKS) helps by feeding her information she passes on to Hurt. Of course she becomes conflicted about her feelings for ace reporter Brooks and equally strong attraction to the pretty-boy anchorman Hurt, who's having his own dalliance with a pretty staff member.  You have to wait until twenty minutes before the film ends to find out which man she'll end up with. Brooks tells her that Hurt is the wrong one because he represents everything she's against. In this unpredictable comedy, there's no telling who Hunter (the neurotic heroine) will end up with.  Fittingly, HOLLY HUNTER, WILLIAM HURT and ALBERT BROOKS were all nominated for Oscars (Brooks in supporting role), as was the film itself and director/writer James L. Brooks. All in all, seven well deserved Oscar nominations.  The script doesn't opt for a conventional happy ending--and, in this case, that's the only flaw for the brilliant screenplay. I felt cheated and somewhat let down by the wistful conclusion.\", \"From producer/writer/Golden Globe nominated director James L. Brooks (Terms of Endearment, As Good as It Gets) this is a really good satirical comedy film showing behind the scenes in the life of a news reporter/anchor/journalist or producer might be like. Basically Jane Craig (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Holly Hunter) falls for new reporter Tom Grunick (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated William Hurt), but correspondent Aaron Altman (Oscar nominated Albert Brooks) also has strong feelings for her. The network prepares for big changes, and sparks will fly with all members of the studio. Also starring Jack Nicholson as anchor Bill Rorich, Moonraker's Lois Chiles as Jennifer Mack, Mrs. Doubtfire's Robert Prosky as Ernie Merriman, School of Rock's Joan Cusack as Blair Litton, Peter Hackes as Paul Moore, Christian Clemenson as Bobby, Robert Katims as Martin Klein, Ed Wheeler as George Wein and Stephen Mendillo as Gerald Grunick. The comedy is subtle but strong, the romance has it's moments, and it is certainly a believable situation film. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture. It was number 64 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!\", \"\\\"Broadcast News\\\" is directed by James L. Brooks (Terms of Endearment, As Good As It Gets) and has a great cast, including William Hurt, Albert Brooks, and Holly Hunter. Everyone gives a good performance, but they're all too unlikable to really care about them.  Some parts of the film are really brilliant, such as the prologue, and the short scenes with Jack Nicholson. The main reason it doesn't entirely work, is it's a film that relies on the characters being amusing rather than amusing things happening to them.  You could consider it nothing more than a drama, but it's often too silly to be successful there as well. Still, the script makes it worth a watch. Certainly not for everyone.  7.0 out of 10\", \"I say sadly because if you see this movie now, you realize how low our media has sunk- all the warning signs are in this movie.  It's a great film, I think the last great James Brooks film, but others may disagree. It has rich characters (who are believable as well), great acting, great writing, and although the music got a little cheesy, I even liked that.  William Hurt has never been better. Holly Hunter is stunning. And Albert Brooks walks away with every scene he's in- this triangle of people is beautifully drawn and compelling and made the whole movie soar above it's vital and important topic of the News, and how it's slowly being compromised in our nation.  Watch this with NETWORK for a truly fun and frightening evening.\", \"James L. Brook is one of those directors who always seems to take a quirky look at life. He isn't only the producer for \\\"The Simpsons,\\\" he has some classic comedies under his belt -- \\\"Broadcast News\\\" is one of them.  Although it doesn't match his later effort \\\"As Good As It Gets,\\\" \\\"Broadcast News\\\" is still a very clever, funny and witty movie about a television broadcasting station and all the problems they suffer. There's a great comedic sequence of physical humor where Joan Cusack is running around the building trying to rush a news tape to the editing room in a matter of mere minutes before it is to be broadcast live on TV.  This isn't only very truthful in terms of how hectic broadcasting stations are operated, but also a skillful and honest portrayal of human beings.  A low-key, subtle movie with good acting (especially from Hurt, who I don't always like so much) and apt direction.\", \"I'm sitting around going through movie listings and not really seeing anything I want to see. My appetite keeps saying, \\\"Something like BROADCAST NEWS.\\\" That's what I want. Something smart and funny, with adult ideas and great acting and writing, and a directorial style that doesn't call attention to itself. This may well be Hurt's best performance (is this or THE BIG CHILL, to my mind): however eccentric, Hurt is smart, and to play an unintelligent person without making sure -- wink wink -- the audience knows -- wink wink -- hey, I'M not stupid... well, that's fine acting right there. Hunter is note-perfect, and Albert Brooks is a revelation. (And he can read and sing at the same time!) Great, great work.  \", \"Essential viewing for anyone who watches TV news as it may help to become a little more sceptical, or even cynical. On a personal note I recall taking a course some years ago about being interviewed for TV - what to do, what not to do. The course instructors impressed on us that TV news was a \\\"branch of show-biz\\\". That depressing view, which is probably even more valid today than when it was made, is reinforced by this film. Never mind journalistic integrity, what counts is the ability to look good and smile nicely. And make sure you don't sweat on camera.  The interactions between the three main characters form the centre-piece, each with his or her own ambitions, capabilities and beliefs. Brooks takes these differences and sets them into the volatile setting of a TV news studio, and adds more than a pinch of love interest to the mixture. The result is a complex, if somewhat overlong, portrayal of how we compromise every day in order to meet our ambitions and take others with us. It is always entertaining, although the final scene was, perhaps, unnecessary given everything that had gone before.\", \"Excellent movie about a big media firm and the goings on both on and off camera. Covering several years, the film centers on 3 upwardly mobile, young hopefuls, all striving for their place within the corporation. Well written dialogue, flawless acting, and a riveting story made for 2 hours of solid entertainment.\", \"This movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. The dialog is crisp, the pace is fast. Not only is this a clever comedy, this is an interesting look at what goes on behind the scenes in the television news business.  There are so many funny lines...a couple of my favorites:  Ernie Merriman: (sarcastically) It must be nice to always believe you know better, to always think you're the smartest person in the room. Jane: (seriously) NO, it's not, it's awful!!  Aaron: He must be good looking Jane: How do you know that? Aaron: No one invites a bad looking idiot to their room!  The performances of Holly Hunter, Albert Brooks, and William Hurt were absolutely brilliant! Even years later, I remember this movie well. Often forgotten is the wonderfully funny Joan Cusack! I love the scene where the newsroom personnel are racing to beat a deadline. There are so many funny scenes that it's hard to pick a favorite. I highly recommend this film.\", \"For me this wonderful rollercoaster of a film bears repeated pleasurable viewings. Its about the tangled lives of three very different people. Holly Hunter is the obsessive workaholic producer. Albert Brookes plays the unprepossessing but brilliant journalist. William Hurt is the affable but dumb new kid on the block, news anchor.  The classical love triangle emerges with the stunningly witty and self deprecating Brookes in love with Hunter but she of course is attracted to Hurt.  This film works on many levels. At the very least it is a brilliant comedy with the one liners flying so thick and fast that each viewing bears a new harvest of ones that you may have missed last time. Its also a film about attraction and unfulfilled romance.  But perhaps most importantly the film examines the modern obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over intellect as a valued human attribute. This is personified by the meteoric career success of the Hurt character in contrast to Brookes relative decline.  Despite being fifteen years old the film has some startingly relevant messages about modern news values and the continuing decline in journalistic standards.  This film is a classic in every sense and it is difficult to understand why it has been so neglected\"], \"review_score\": [10, 8, 8, 10, 8, 10, 9, 9, 9, 7, 10, 8, 8, 10, 7, 9, 9, 7, 10, 8, 7, 7, 7, 10, 7, 9, 7, 8, 9, 9], \"review_category\": [\"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 8.466666666666667}, \"A Bucket of Blood\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0052655\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0103893\", \"total_review_count\": 5, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"I'm a huge, make that HUGE fan of the TV show, so I had always wanted to see the movie that started it all. What a let-down. It's as if Joss Whedon was using the movie as a practice session. The dialogue was mediocre at best, effects were non-existent, and the characters weren't developed at all. Not to mention it was anti-climatic. I realize it was low-budget, but man, it was low. I'm actually surprised that they decided to even give it a second chance as a TV show. It's not like any character from the TV show was in the movie, except for Buffy, of course.  Joss Whedon certainly got it all right with the TV show (if it weren't for the title, so outdated now), but I'd keep happy thoughts about the TV show, and skip the movie altogether.\", \"Yes I remember going to a country drive-in to see this movie.

I am glad some-one saw promise in this old C-Grade movie.Cause I never would have!\", \"When a film that's had such a bad press as \\\"Buffy\\\" still manages to disappoint you, that's one bad film. For much of its running time it manages to be no worse than mediocre - a sort of sub-\\\"Clueless\\\" (which, to be fair, it predates by three years), with Kristy Swanson doing well enough as a sub-Alicia Silverstone. It also has much the same agenda as \\\"Clueless\\\" of taking a gentle poke at affluent society's rigid class system and wafer-thin \\\"caring about the environment\\\" values. Presumably Joss Whedon's script originally had rather more in this direction; it seems to be set up that Buffy and her class are vampires too, but nothing is done with this idea.   \\\"Clueless\\\" had the advantage of a plot by Jane Austen. As soon as \\\"Buffy\\\"'s plot starts, things rapidly collapse. Disaster is staved off for a while by Swanson's energy, Donald Sutherland's ability to keep a straight face, and Paul Reuben's touching conviction that he's in a funny film. But never has Rutger Hauer's natural screen presence been so totally neutralized by poor direction, unfocused character design and a story that's not only increasingly incomprehensible but not even worth trying to follow. Again, there is an idea here: Whedon seems to want to posit a sort of eternal attraction between vampires and those who slay them, so that being the slayer according to the traditional rules simply confirms and strengthens the vampires' power. But it all goes for nothing.   The fact that the themes and characters are so far removed from that of the spin-off series means that the movie doesn't actually suffer from comparisons with it. It just suffers from being rubbish. Kudos to Fox for being talked into taking on this botched project for a remarkable series, and, for that matter, for suggesting Sarah Michelle Gellar should play Buffy rather than Cordelia. Execs get a bad press, let's give them a moment's appreciation.\", \"But who would have known that in 1992? There are enough comic moments to make this show worth watching but not more that twice. I would have thought that it would be a little funnier but the jokes made about Valley girls or girls in general not only ring false, but are almost trite.\", \"A prime example of a poor film. Ignoring the story we are left with a film that lacks energy and drive. The characters are flat and lifeless and you are left hoping they all die. Rutger Hauer turns in a rare poor performance, was he ill at the time? He does not even do his own sword fight yet we know he is capable as seen in Blind Fury in fact he doesn't move much at all.

As for the big surprise, it certainly was not a secret to me. It was telegraphed way ahead of time, so that my reaction at the fateful moment was \\\"is that all there is?\\\". I actually kept watching the rest of the movie since I was expecting something bigger or more shocking.  Nothing at all special about this movie.\", \"There I was, peacefully enjoying the movie. It was quite good, realistic atmosphere, authentic dialogue etc. THEN came the twist... I'm sorry I can't tell you about the rest of the film, I switched it off after that...   NOT because I was offended or repulsed, but because the big 'surprise' had NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with what had gone before it. It just came completely out of left field. When even the film's tagline shamelessly promotes the one big 'shock' in the movie for all it's worth, you can be sure the rest of the film that's built around it won't be much cop.

It's schoolboy stuff; and that's really who this film should be aimed at, despite the clamouring of the pseudo-intellectual crowd who claim to love it for its 'daring'. Pssshht.\", \"I've got a spoiler for you so if you don't want to look at a spoiler look away right now O.K. here's the spoiler: this movie sucks big time.  The utter craptitude of this project is beyond shame. A political Trojan horse of a movie if there ever was one. I should have suspected something when I kept trying to determine whether I had stepped into something on the way home from Blockbuster only to realize that the odour was emanating from my blockbuster bag. Never has an olfactory sensation so shocked my senses. Undeterred I removed it from its Pandora's box and unleashed it upon my DVD player. The movie did give me a million dollar idea however-google could invent a penis pop-up blocker for the DVD player, I know I'd buy one. I've had political agendas crammed in my face before but this is ridiculous (pun intended). If certain people want to push their beliefs that is fine but to do it in an underhanded style such as this is disgusting and abusive. Using shock value as your only means of persuasion is unintelligent and actually childish. What if in Bambi at the end a little kid came up hunting with his dad, cocked a shotgun with one hand and blew Bambi's brains all over the screen Pulp Fiction NC-17 style? Then immediately they cut to an American flag waving and patriotic music playing, and a shot of the kid hugging his proud father with a screen that said The End brought to you by the NRA. That would be the shocking equivalent. Never before has a movie sucked in this way and perhaps...one never will again.\", \"I looked at the box and saw a sexy glamorous woman with a gun and thought she was going to go around shooting people and that the \\\"unexpected plot twists\\\" meant something like Pulp Fiction. This is not so -- this movie is mostly about a bizarre friendship and a bizarre romance with some nasty violent scenes thrown in. I found it mostly slow and occasionally creepy (watch out for the Irish Terrorists), and I think that in dividing itself between the male bonding and the love story it failed to make either part very compelling.\", \"Even The Simpsons said that this movie is great, so I decided to see it. But with knowing the big surprise this film is just a laugh. I think that it was very shocking when it came in the cinemas but now with knowing what happens, this film is nothing but a big joke. The first half of the film is pretty boring, and I didn't check why Fergus and Jody had to become friends. Jody didn't seem to be so nice and friendly. All the cursing of him turned really on my nerves because it didn't seem to be necessary. Then there is this big cut in the middle and you think another movie starts. With the new haircut of Fergus and the change of the setting there seems to be no connection between the two halfs. With knowing that Dil is a man, you always have to think about the outcoming and you just can't wait till it happens. And when it happens there is no reason for watching the film anymore. You think about why doesn't he leave this pervert or when he doesn't how they are going to have sex. Also you think about how Jody and Dil might have had sex and you can't understand that Jody first wanted to sleep with Jude.  The Oscar for the best screenplay is not earned because there are things I already have counted up. Also the nomination for best picture and best director seem to be not right. It is no good movie at all and the only thing worth watching it, is to see this girl's penis. Stephen Rea's acting is very simple so I'd like to question that nomination also. It is not bad, but I think almost anyone could act as good as this, there were no big challenges for him. Jaye Davidson really seems to be a woman, but with knowing, that he/she is a man you can see that the face is not woman-like.  So I think with knowing what happens in the film before watching it, this is just a waste of time. And even when you don't know what will happen, which you now know because I said it, it is also not worth the time.\", \"I really tried to like this movie. The critics (before I knew better) raved about this film so much it got me pumped up to see it. Well, to say it was a letdown is putting it mildly.

I learned the hard way how sick mainline film critics are since they just loved the idea of a key character in the film turning out to be a transsexual. Wow! Cool! (Okay, if you say so.)  There are just too many uncomfortable, sordid and dark scenes in this movie, including a horrible first 15 minutes in which Forest Whitaker is a hysterical IRA hostage out in the middle of the woods.

That is what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot' Stallone's career.  Cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers dream, especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing, base-jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. All in all it's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk. Stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse! However, if you an forget all the nonsense, it's actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills, and unintentionally, plenty of laughs.  You've got to love John Lithgows sneery evilness, his tick every box band of baddies, and best of all, the permanently harassed and hapless 'turncoat' agent, Rex Linn as Travers.  He may of been Henry in 'Portrait of a Serial Killer' but Michael Rooker is noteworthy for a cringe-worthy performance as Hal, he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors 'that man never hurt anybody' And whilst he surely can't be, it really does look like Ralph Waite's Frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death.  Mention too must go to former 'London's Burning' actor Craig Fairbrass as the Brit bad guy, who comes a cropper whilst using Hal as a Human Football, yes, you can't help enjoy that bit, Hal needed a good kicking.  So forget your better judgement, who cares if 'that could never happen', lower your acting expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy!

But the movie has numerous assets : breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed, stunning special and visual effects ( the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film ), excellent musical score, welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension, and a solid cast : two heroes ( Stallone, star and cowriter, has the lion's share of the footage, but the excellent Michael Rooker more than stands his ground ), a charming heroin ( Janine Turner ), and one of the most darstardy bunch of villains ever ( priceless John Lithgow and deceivingly feminine Caroline Goodall, but also Rex Linn - in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it, Leon, Craig Fairbrass ) Good, solid entertainment then , if no credibility.As Roger Ebert wrote ( about another film )\\\"It's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much.\\\"  \", \"The selection of Sylvester Stallone to perform the protagonist by Renny Harlin is commendable since Stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of Rocky Balbao and Rambo. But to compare Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is a far-fetched notion.  The excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill, suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws. The heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before.  The biting cold of the snow capped Alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation. The forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end.  Good movies are not made every year and people don't get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then. Apart from the filthy language/parlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes, the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years.\", \"This movie is just great. It's entertaining from beginning to the end, you're always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie. In my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics.  Sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain-rescue guy Gabe Walker. Together with him Michael Rooker makes a great appearance as Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances I've seen of him as a villain.  And the fact that 75% of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action!   Brilliant movie!\", \"Cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director Renny Harlin whose admirable in making this movie about an expert climber who finds himself taken hostage with a fellow friend by a gang of dangerous criminals on the search for suit cases full of stolen cash in the Rocky Mountains. Sylvester Stallone is impressive as Gabe Walker the expert climber especially in the action/fight sequences but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic. For the sake of the film though I willing to suspend my disbelief. The rest of the cast including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall, and Leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the movie. The action/fight sequences are well executed but as mentioned before some aren't very realistic no matter how tough you are. The climbing sequences however are very well done because instead of doing the whole film in a studio somewhere the locations they chose felt very real and the Ariel views of the mountain ranges are marvelous adding a touch of reality to the movie. The deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable. The villains are solid but it would've been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them. The pacing of the movie was a little slow but the good outweighs the bad in this one. If you're a big fan of Harlins or Stallone's than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. Overall Cliffhanger has character development with enough action, drama, some suspense, excitement, thrills, and good performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch.\", \"Was this based on a comic-book? A video-game? A drawing by a 3 year-old?   There is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all; not the characters, not the dialog, not the plot, not the action. Nothing. We have high-tech international terrorists/criminals who bicker like pre-school kids, Stallone's man-of-steel-type resilience towards ice-cold weather, dialog so dumb that it's sometimes almost hilarious, and so on. Even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb (\\\"tango-tango\\\"). A film that entertains through some suspense, good action-sequences, and a nice snowy mountainous setting. Oh, yes: and the unintentional humour.  The film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go-lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a \\\"swell\\\" time. Then comes a sweat-inducing failed-rescue part, which should make anyone with fear-of-heights problems want to pull their hair out. And then we have some more bad dialog, and after that some more great action. This is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell.   Stallone's melodramatic exchange with Turner, when they meet after a long time, is so soapy, so clich\\u00e9d, so fake, and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self-respecting viewer. Soon after this display of awful dialog-writing, we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane. The entire action is one big absurdity, but it's mindless fun at its best. Although the rest of the action is exciting and fun, the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film. After the landing, our master-criminals seek for a guide and end up with Stallone and Rooker. They send Stallone to fetch the first case of money, but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it; they take most of his clothes off (so he can freeze) and they won't give him the equipment he needs (so he can fall off). DO THESE GANGSTERS WANT THEIR MONEY FETCHED OR NOT??? Very silly. Apparently they don't trust Stallone, but surely they know that they can always black-mail him by using Rooker as a hostage. Nevertheless, our gangsters make Stallone's climb difficult, if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are - lest there be any doubts. And for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are, they overact, brag, and snicker in a truly evil manner. Everyone convinced? Good. You'd better be. Otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children, just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal-clear to everyone.  The old guy who flies the chopper... How the hell did he fall for the trap? Firstly, he must have been warned by the MTV airhead about the criminals, and secondly, he must have heard Stallone's and Rooker's voices on the walkie-talkies. A whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place, with Lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines. \\\"Get off my back!\\\" Lithgow: \\\"I haven't even started climbing on your back.\\\" Or, Lithgow to Stallone: \\\"We had a deal, but now we only have each other!\\\" And as for Lithgow's gang of murderers: these guys never seem to want to kill immediately. They are very creative about it; they philosophize, pretend that they are playing football with your body, and so on.   Stallone co-wrote this thing. I have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it. I'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low I.Q.\", \"Since I first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite. Since then I've seen it countless times and I never get tired of it. The setting has a lot to do with it (the Colorado I know would be jealous), but the storyline is original and I liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes. There has not been a movie I can compare this too. John Lithgow plays a smart villain, but I love how he is completely out of his element--he has to follow Tucker around and that's what keeps it interesting. This is an action movie at it's BEST. I don't think I'll see another that is so entertaining.  You don't need 50,000 rounds fired to qualify as an action movie. It just has to keep you captivated, not shell-shocked.\", \"To be honest, I didn't like that much this movie when I saw it for the first time. But I guess the trouble is that I haven't seen it in a theater. Big Mistake ! Because the #1 thing to see in Cliffhanger is the settings and #2 is the cinematography. Try to see this movie on the largest TV possible and a great sound system. The music is good and puts the movie to a higher level (and a commercial potential). The more I see it, the more I like it.  It's definitely one of Renny Harlin's best movie. THis guy knows about action. Die Hard 2, The long kiss good bye, etc. And it's particularly good in this movie. The special effect are great and spectacular. Stallone really needed that movie get back with success. Still good to see him !\", \"I'm far from a Sylvester Stallone fan and I guess the only time I really appreciated his appearance was in the French movie Taxi 3, which is an almost inexistent small role. And yet I must admit that this movie was actually not that bad, even though I feared the worst.  When Gabe (Stallone) fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top, he can't possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger. For almost a year he doesn't set a food in the reserve, but than he returns. Soon after he's back, they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm. At least, that's what the rangers believe. In reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed. The cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them...  This is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever, but in its genre it's an enjoyable one. I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers. I know him best from the TV-series \\\"3rd Rock from the Sun\\\", but I enjoyed his performance in this movie as well. Overall the acting is OK, it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one-liners, but it also offered a very nice decor. This movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment. I loved the snowy mountains and valleys, the mountain rivers and the forests... Perhaps that's why I give this movie a score higher than what I normally give to an action / adventure movie of this kind. I give it a 6.5/10. If you don't expect too much, this is an enjoyable movie.\", \"Watching Cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early '90s, a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as \\\"Die Hard in a /on a.\\\" Cliffhanger is \\\"Die Hard on a mountain,\\\" and pretty good, for what it is.  But unlike Passenger 57 and Under Siege, which are decent Die Hard clones on their own terms, Cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that, in their immensity, threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks.  Years before other movies like A Simple Plan and Fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations, Cliffhanger director Renny Harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings.  The opening sequence has already received substantial praise, all of which it deserves: its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening. Not even Harlin's shot of the falling stuffed animal, which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke (and which he repeated in Deep Blue Sea), or the ridiculous expression on Ralph Waite's face, can dim the sequence's power.  The next impressive set-piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet. As written by Stallone and Michael France and directed by Harlin, the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not: the bloody double-crosses are completely unexpected. As Roger Ebert has observed, the stuntman who made the mid-air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition.  Later, during the avalanche sequence, one of the terrorists/thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain. So far as I know, no one was killed in the making of this movie (a small miracle, considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts), so obviously a dummy was used for the shot. But the shot itself remains impressive because we're left wondering how Harlin (or more likely one of the second-unit directors) knew exactly where to place the camera.  I'll take Sly Stallone as my action hero any day of the week, because he's one of the few movie stars I've ever seen who's completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain, and at the same time actually feels that pain. The role of Gabe Walker really complements Stallone's acting strengths: he plays an older, more vulnerable kind of action hero, giving an impressively low-key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself.  In contrast to many of today's post-Matrix, comic book-inspired action heroes, Stallone's Walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer-enhanced abilities. In Cliffhanger, the hero almost freezes to death, and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another. He winces when he's hit and bleeds when he's cut, particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a Rocky-style pummeling from one of the mad-dog villains.  It should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie's effectiveness: when I first saw this movie as a teenager, I was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust (or rather, the ice); at one point I actually cheered as one of the most cold-blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise.  Lithgow's British accent is as unconvincing as the movie's occasional model plane or model helicopter, but he's fundamentally a good actor, and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue: in one scene, looking at his hostages Stallone and Rooker, trying to decide which tasks to give them, he actually says \\\"You, stay! You, fetch!\\\" Even a better actor, such as Anthony Hopkins, might have had trouble with that line.  Even if Cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside, it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show.  Early in the movie, for example, Lithgow openly says to one of his men \\\"Retire [Stallone] when he comes down.\\\" No real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously: his carelessness allows Rooker to shout a warning up to Sly on the rock face, and this precipitates a gripping tug-of-war between Stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg.  Lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means, but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn't given Rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor.  Done very much in the style of a Saturday matinee serial or (at times) a Western, Cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film.  Besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before, the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with REALLY fake snow, as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action-packed narrative. Finally, Harlin's decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless, since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes.  It's a shame that Stallone is now too old for action movies, because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably I wonder what he would be like years later. But perhaps it's best that Cliffhanger stands on its own for all time, without a sequel: there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already. There was an unofficial sequel that called itself Vertical Limit: compared to that clinker, Cliffhanger belongs on the IMDb's Top 250 list.  Rating: 8 (Very good, especially considering most of Stallone's other movies.)\", \"Sly's best out and out action film. It is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters, solid performances and Renny Harlins direction is stylishly assured. Stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes. This was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90's, a definite genre classic. As a Stallone fan this is one I look back on with fond memories. Plenty of superb action and Sly in prime action man form. Action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film. The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****\", \"Wracked with guilt after a lot of things felt apart on that ledge, an ace mountain rescue climber Gabriel Walker (Stallone) comes back for his girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner), while over the cloudy skies where the weather looks a bit threatening, a spectacularly precarious mid-air hijacking goes wrong and $100 million taken from a Treasury Department plane get lost in the middle of nowhere followed by a crash landing\\u0085   Stranded off the snowy peaks, and needing mountain guides to win back the stolen cash, the high-trained hikers make an emergency call asking the help of a rescue unit\\u0085   Unfortunately, Gab and Hall (Michael Rooker) have to team up to arrive at the scene of the crash unaware that the distress call was a fake, and a bunch of merciless terrorists led by a psychotic (John Lithgow),are waiting for them only to find out a way off the stormy mountain with the dumped cases of money\\u0085   With breathtaking shots, vertiginous scenery, dizzying heights, perilous climbs, freezing temperatures, \\\"Cliffhanger\\\" is definitely Stallone's best action adventure movie\\u0085\", \"I don't think I'll ever understand the hate for Renny Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' was cool, and he gave the world 'Cliffhanger', one of the most awesome action movies ever. That's right, you little punks, 'Cliffhanger' rules, and we all know it.  Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former rescue climber who is 'just visiting' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), assist in a rescue on a mountain peak. Walker obviously came back at a convenient time, because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the U.S. government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really would like it back...  Essentially, 'Cliffhanger' is another 'Die Hard' clone. Just trade in the confines of Nakatomi Plaza to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains, complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal. Naturally, that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough, as Stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease, and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects. After all, isn't that what action movies are all about?  'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around. A showcase of great scenes and stunts. One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning, it maintains its action awesomeness. John Lithgow's lead villain is entertaining, and one bad dude. Quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever.  'Cliffhanger' is easily one of Stallone's best efforts, definitely Renny Harlin's best effort, and a very exciting action movie - 9/10\", \"I don't know who wrote the script for this movie, but from the first moment on, I was irritated. Of all possible decisions they could make up in the mountains, why do they make the decision, which is the most dangerous of all? Why do the criminals act dumb, although they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it? Why doesn't the main criminal land the helicopter, shoot Stallone, grab the money and fly away with the chick as a hostage? And there are more cases of illogical behavior. I'd give this movie 5 points for nice action and great landscape scenery, but due to the illogical behavior of the characters, I just can give this movie 1 point...\", \"I saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor, and we found the entire thing so ridiculous as to be beyond pity. (For one, if Stallone is out free-climbing by himself, there's no need to carry any gear, but I guess those dangling carabiners look sorta \\\"mountain climby,\\\" so let's throw them in). For those lobotomized folks who think that Colorado looks anything like the Dolomites in Italy (where the movie was filmed), well the Hollywood moguls have got a lot more ridiculous & foul-smelling stuff for you to swallow.\", \"There are some Stallone movies I like, but this movie didn't meet my low expectations. I found this movie hard to believe. For example, a bunch of terrorists who crash land in the wilderness are prepared to survive for at least two days. Also, in all this wilderness Stallone and company keep running across bridges and ladders that provide convenient short-cuts or plot devices. Also, the Treasury cops don't seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people. Also, bad guys who couldn't hit the side of a barn with really high-tech looking automatic weapons.  I liked John Lithgow's villain initially, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesn't care at all about any of his own bad guys, or all of them getting killed. Eventually I just couldn't believe the character anymore.  Not worth the price of a rental, not even worth taking the time to watch.\", \"Let me start by stating that I usually do like Renny Harlin's directing style, for the most part, and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots. Unlike Harlin's \\\"Elm Street 4\\\", and \\\"Die Hard 2\\\" which I really liked, there is something that is missing from this movie. That, my friends, is a script. The dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful, but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity. There are so many awful lines in this movie, I don't even want to have to remember any of them. Not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure. It's almost like Harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said, they could improve the script. Wrong again.  The sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue. Stallone has never been a favorite of mine, but when he is acting circles around Lithgow, Turner, and the worst of the bunch Rooker, there is something wrong with this picture. Lithgow played one of the best villains in \\\"Ricochet\\\", yet comes across as someone who can't act to save his life here. How is that possible? I've always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by Stallone, who himself still phoned-in his performance. Turner's part is so small and pointless, but she still manages to appear lost on screen. Michael Rooker CAN act. I know this because I have witnessed it in \\\"Days of Thunder\\\", but he seems like he is READING his lines from cue cards. Has it come to this? When Rooker and Lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking, I just wanted the movie to end right there, or have them both amazingly find their acting ability. Unfortunately, neither of those things occurred.  Which brings me back to Harlin, who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters. It's his fault that I was never drawn into this movie at all, because he should have made the people actually act. The script is not very good, but still the actors' performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director. I don't care how much was paid for the special effects, which for the most part are good, you still can't just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting.   Plus, the pacing of this movie seems to be off. The opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done, but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all. I mean I understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene, but I really didn't care if they got the money or not in that scene. If the bad guy's would have won early, maybe I wouldn't have had to witness one of the worst movies ever!\", \"I am still shuddering at the thought of EVER seeing this movie again.  I have seen action films, I have even liked quite a few of them, but this one goes over the top.  Not only does it have the worst male actor ever (Sly Stallone) playing the lead role, but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning (why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground, would be hell of a lot easier) that it requires a person with IQ less than his shoenumber to believe it.   Furthermore, the plot has no real twists at all, a three year old kid could guess what comes next. It is a set of cliches (of action genre), with Sly performing even worse than his other movies (he was better even in Rambo III if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film). Now there is an actor who can't act A) surprised B) sad C) anything else than his basic face.   I would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it. EXPLOSIONS are outstanding, but then... you can see better on the 4th of July. LANDSCAPES are magnificient, but then... there are documentaries about the Alps and Himalayas, so you can see better sights that way, rather than waste time on this flick.  Go watch some other movie instead, there are hundreds, even thousands better action movies.\", \"If you like the standard Sly flicks that involve over the top action, unbelievable stunts (unbelievable is not intended to be complimentary here), and retarded dialogue; you will love this steaming pile of mountain goat dung. I had high hopes based on the trailer. I thought that Stalone was going to be forced in his \\\"has-been\\\" days to yield to smarter people and make an action film that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where the story, setting, and (believable) action would prevail. I crave action that is at least close enough to reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that would come from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects rendered at least one scene laughably ridiculous. Judge Dredd is only better because you know going into the theater that you are going to see a comic book made into a movie. The character, setting and everything else are beyond comparison to anything we might encounter ourselves. Cliffhanger on the other hand turns a mountain climbing guide into Rambo before you can say \\\"yo, Adrian!\\\"\", \"Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! Cowritten by and starring Sylvester Stallone\\u0097that should have been enough\\u0097and featuring too many rock-climbing scenes, vertigo, falling, and scene-chewing villains and a botched airborne heist. There are two plots, both lame. One involves a traumatic failed rescue, and the other involves bad people wrecking an airplane for booty, and killing various harmless people whenever possible. The usually reliable John Lithgow, perhaps depressed by the sheer awfulness of the product, is reduced to sneering and calling those for whom he doesn't care \\\"Bostid!\\\" in a vague approximation of an English accent. Janine Turner, who was sprightly and enigmatic when she played Maggie on Northern Exposure, is sadly wasted in the part of a rescue climber and pilot. Stallone is stolid and muscle-headed. No deathless lines in this one. No living lines, either.\", \"This is one of the worse cases of film drivel I have seen in a long while. It is so awful, that I am not sure where to begin, or even if it is worth it. The plot is the real problem, and I feel sorry for 'Sly' as he puts in a decent performance for his part. But that plot ... Oh dear oh dear. I particularly love the way near the end he manages to pop from the foot of a mountain to the top, whilst the helicopter is on the way. A climb of a day or two takes him all of five minutes! I could go on: but it isn't worth it. Apart from the grim opening (which even a five year old would be able to predict the outcome of) the rest is drivel. Sorry folks, but this is about as bad as film making gets.\", \"Once in a while, a movie will sweep along that stuns you, draws you in, awes you, and, in the end, leaves you with a renewed belief in the human race from the artistry form.

At some parts it is so awfully stupid that I just can't help laughing at it all. Try me for the sequence where Stallone's character jumps some 20 meters with full climbing gear or (and this is really my favorite) snuffs a bad guy by sticking him onto a stalactite. Yeah, what ungodly strength did he muster to accomplish such feats?

I suffered through it all the time. I would rather get whipped 100 times than watch this horrible piece of s**t ever again. People ONLY love it because of it's satire of society, which makes no sense. For someone who knows how you actually make a movie, this is a joke. I can actually tell you about the ONLY time I watched it - it was when I was studying the art of film making. In class, the teacher told us we should watch it. Afterwards, our teacher said she actually likes the movie (like most people unfortunately do), but still, she told us this is NOT HOW YOU MAKE A MOVIE. That says it all. And just for the record - this is the only movie that have actually managed to make me feel like a brainless weirdo who should go and bite my hands off, while I dance like a idiot.\", \"I think that this film is one of the most over-rated films of all time. I would rate it below average - extra points go to the originality and art. I feel that the film lacks coherence, and I had a difficult time actually being interested throughout the film. I am not entirely sure what Kubrick was trying to achieve here, but in my personal opinion, I think this film was over-rated. I think the reason why it is so popular is that it questions life, and it focuses on taboo topics. There's the element of \\\"shock value\\\" and the fact that no one else would have dared to make a film like this.  Overall, I have seen much better films and I don't know what all the hype is about.\", \"My opinion: the movie has got a very solid potential to be one of the most powerful sci-fi drama, but instead, it turns into a nasty piece of cinema. Couldn't this movie get along without that phallic statuette with which a lonely cat woman was killed? Couldn't be those disgusting human-like furniture be avoided? Couldn't the sex/rape/beat scenes be less showcasing? Sure it could. Those scenes don't make the movie better, but ruin it (at least for me). I have an impression that the director did not control himself and did not know where to stop. A real artist must have that feeling inside himself. \\\"Mad Max\\\" is art, while this movie is not.  I can easily guess, that my opinion is not in the general stream but I have to point it out. I bought this movie on DVD (I trusted IMDb rating too much those days) and I think I will have to throw it away, while there are too many scenes which I want to skip. I repeat: it has very strong potential. If the initial material had been professionally cut, the movie would be marvellous sci-fi drama (like \\\"Solyaris\\\"). But it gets into a ditch with those dirty and low elements. Camera-work doesn't save it. Besides, anyone can use classical music. It is not a \\\"plus\\\". Use your own beautifully composed and that will be a \\\"boost\\\".  To finish it all with a slash, I had the same unpleasant experience when watched \\\"Caligula\\\". Also a dirty movie but with great potential.  Sorry to say, but it is a raw product: 2 out of 10. Thanks for attention.\", \"Oh my. I watched the film about a fortnight after I read the book. Amazing? Oh I was amazed indeed. Other than some nice photography shots, the film lack intensely. I place the book on my top 5 without a doubt. The film however...I'm not one to compare a book to it's film because they are two different mediums and are not meant for comparison, however for any of you who desire to see this film I suggest you step back with your hands out and get the book instead. Enough satisfaction will be found there. Horrible cinematography, BAD ACTING...holy crap! Alex is the sociopath with no emotion...NOT EVERYONE ELSE. And excessive nudity. I have no problem with nudity, if it is done tastefully and necessarily. This film did none of the above. Loved the eye lashes though ;)\", \"I had looked forward to seeing 'A Clockwork Orange' for a long time before my opportunity to see it came. It's one of those films like 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Fight Club' that young men like me have been trained to look forward to. Unlike 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Fight Club' I did not find it stimulating, thought-provoking, revolutionarily groundbreaking or, for that matter, remotely enjoyable on any level. The reform scenes sickened me, as did the rape scene, the dialogue, the costumes and even some of the sets. I have never seen eye to eye with Kubrick's visions but this films is far and away my most heavily disliked film of all time. I do not pan it with a complete lack of stars as I found Malcolm McDowell's performance to be one of the most unique I have ever seen and that deserves credit, but I can say without a doubt that 'A Clockwork Orange' will be far displaced from my viewing screens for a good few years until I am up to the challenge once more.\", \"I have never seen this film until last night. Everyone says it's absolutely amazing and terrifying. I expected this to make my skin crawl. A Clockwork Orange has to be one of the worst films I have ever had to watch. The first twenty minutes were okay because it was not boring, then holy crap, the rest of the movie was flat out dreadful! I could not believe that this film got all great reviews. Do critics enjoy boring, non-psychological crap from the 70's? I guess so! There was honestly no point what so ever to this disgusting film. The story line was terrible, the acting was below horrid, and the fact that this movie is a cult classic makes me sick to my stomach. Terrible, terrible film.\", \"I am utterly shocked at how bad this movie was. I'm tired and don't feel like going very in depth, but here's why this movie is horrible. And there will be spoilers.  We have a main character we hate because he enjoys raping and killing innocent people.  We are then supposed to sympathize with him, which we don't, because we hate him. This goes on for a VERY long time. Horrible things happen to him, but we don't really care, because he's a bad person.  The movie is extremely long and drawn out. It climaxes so many times that it's very anti-climatic by the ending.  We are supposed to get a sense of irony out of Alex going from a sociopath to someone who is constantly being beaten and tortured while he can't use the very thing that got him in the situation, violence, to help himself. We do not get this sense of irony because the movie is CONTRIVED, some examples being: how Alex just happens to run into everyone he ever did wrong one day after getting out of jail (the bum, his droogs, the cripple), or how after Alex luckily is not recognized by the cripple, he goes on to sing the SONG HE SANG WHILE BEATING HIM AND RAPING HIS WIFE while in the cripple's house, as if he were the most idiotic person in the world, which he is obviously not.  The fight scenes are silly and anything but \\\"ultra violent\\\".  The atmosphere of the movie is redeeming and there is some cult/shock value. I give it a 4/10.\", \"As a true film buff, I can accept the fact that some of the greatest movies ever made can also be extremely difficult to watch -- whether from its content and/or the emotional response it generates. Most movies like this usually receive my adolation and praise, even if it may take me time to recover from the first viewing  But in my opinion, A Clockwork Orange takes the grand prize as the most disturbing movie I've ever seen, and it does not get much easier with repeat viewing. The movie's brilliance in directing and storytelling makes it impossible to dismiss critically, yet the film disturbs me to the core. I would almost hope that I am not alone in this opinion -- to truly 'enjoy' this movie you'd have to be pretty damn callous to hideous imagery, especially when it comes to rape and excessive exploitation of the female body.  If there's one very big dislike I have against Stanley Kubrick, it is way in which he treats the naked female body onscreen. It becomes impersonal, cold, devalued -- cheapened and readily exploitable. Think of these examples -- A Clockwork Orange: 5 gangsters rip the clothes off and rape a young woman to a classical waltz; the milk bar with naked women statues and dispensers; Alex's daydream of being in Roman times; the high-speed menage-a-trois; the naked, stoic 'temptress' onstage approaching Alex; and the 'humorous' winter-wonderland end-scene slow-motion daydream of public exhibitionism. That's just A Clockwork Orange. Throw in the naked woman in the tub in The Shining, along with scenes totalling a full one-third of the running time of Eyes Wide Shut and you should have a pretty good idea of the devaluation of the female body I'm referring to.  I think of Spartacus, Full Metal Jacket, 2001, Dr. Strangelove, even Barry Lyndon, and I just want to praise Kubrick forever. The man is a cinematic genius. But, because of how adversely A Clockwork Orange affects me, I must dismiss it and can't recommend it to anyone. The more sensitive you are to what you see onscreen, the more this movie will deeply, deeply disturb you. I've seen it three times now, my first time being over 12 years ago, and it's no easier to watch now than then. And sadly, because it is so disturbing, I am deprived of enjoying the greatness that the movie really does contain.  I read the book by Anthony Burgess because the story is truly brilliant. I was surprised to find out that the book's final chapter was purposely left out of the film. Also, I was surprised to find that the author disliked the film, as he alludes in the book's introduction. He feels that \\\"A Clockwork Orange\\\" has become to him what \\\"The Nutcracker\\\" was to Tchaikovsky -- what he considers as one of his least important works has become his most famous and recognized.  Ever wonder what is meant by \\\"a clockwork orange\\\"? Mr. Burgess explains the metaphor in the book's introduction. An orange is sweet, refreshing, and juicy -- fulfilling and delicious. But it is organic and cannot provide this sweetness forever -- it will eventually expire and rot. Man cannot make an organic object function like an inorganic object, or something man-made, or 'clockwork'. The term 'clockwork orange' is therefore an oxymoron and a paradox -- it infers that man has converted something organic into a controllable, inorganic process. The experiment Alex goes through, by robbing him of free-will, effectively creates 'clockwork oranges' out of human beings -- he is forced to be sweet, gentle, and moral all the time.  Final thoughts: I am LDS (or 'Mormon'), and it's noteworthy to mention something about the beliefs of the LDS religion as it pertains to this concept... It is believed that in pre-earth life, Lucifer proposed that everyone who comes to earth be forced to do good, so that everyone will be worthy to return to God's presence after death, therefore 'no souls will be lost' -- however, he wanted the credit for this plan. Jesus wanted each person to have complete free-agency in order to learn from their own decisions, and he voluteered himself to be the one who must live a perfect life as THE example as well as be the atoning sacrifice -- and all glory go to God, not to himself. To have mankind robbed of its free-agency is the Devil's original plan and ultimate goal. So, the movie and the book asks this supreme question: What's more evil -- a person who focusses all his thoughts and energy and actions on doing bad, or forcing this person to only think and feel and do good?  My answer: Skip the movie and read the book -- it's a far more edifying experience. And you also get to know what happens in the final chapter!\", \"Oh my god. I have never seen any movie this good. I think it is one of the best movies out there. I don't care what the religious people say about the rape and violence, this movie was just great. The acting superb. Rent or buy this movie You will love it.\", \"Do you know what was Mr. Kubrick's big problem? He just couldn't make a crap movie. He is the only filmmaker who's films had such a quality. So if in my opinion he's a master filmmaker and one of his best films (if not THE best, it is hard to say) is ACO I think a 10 is what this movie should have. And next time you all see this movie don't take it TOO seriously, just try to relax and enjoy it passing by all the possible meanings this movie could have. After all if Kubrick wanted us to know what it is all about we would know!\", \"If you don't try to read too much meaning into some of the scenes in this film, you might find that it contains more truth about a 21st century society than anyone cares to admit. I saw this movie on it's original release and thought that it was just an exciting and hilarious ground breaking film ( I believe it had an X rating for a while ), and after seeing it again on DVD - I think it's a masterpiece.\", \"My first experience of watching this movie was inexplicable. Never before I felt such high adrenaline rush for watching a movie. A Clockwork Orange is full of messages and takes an extremely critical stand to society. It shows how the so called 'normal' elements in society are far more weirder and hypocrite than ruffians like the central character -- Alex. Notice how Alex appears more human, more balanced in comparison to his parent's paying guest, a supposedly 'normal' person? How Alex's parents disown him after he returns home from a correctional center?   Also when Alex is taking his final exam to leave the correctional center you can notice that Kubrick is questioning society's parameters of right and wrong. To pass the test and be considered 'sane' Alex must reject the most primitive needs of humans, like avoiding physical contact with an extremely attractive lady and avoid self defense, no matter how badly he is getting beaten. In this scene Kubrick was exposing society's distorted views on righteousness. Why is consensual sex always immoral? Is self defense a crime? Also, notice how the correctional center staff is enjoying to watch Alex being humiliated. This suggests that in reality 'normal' people are just as immoral and wrong as open criminals like Alex and his gang. The only difference being an average person is a closeted immoral, while Alex does his dirty job in the open.  One particular thing which took me by surprise in A Clockwork Orange was the absence of loyalty within Alex's gang. Normally, gang members are shown as being ruthless to strangers, but they behave with utmost trust and loyalty within the gang. Here Kubrick shows them as completely insane minds with no rules or morals.  A Clockwork Orange also shows the government's role to come in the rescue of outcast youngsters and bring them back into mainstream society. The final scenes where the minister privately assists Alex is an indication of that.  Every actor does a splendid job, but Malcom MCDowell as Alex, stands out. The scene of violence where he leads the beating of a homeless man is alone worth the piece of admission.   This is one movie not to be missed. Its both very moving and also extremely entertaining. And it has repeat value as it requires multiple viewings to absorb its tail and enjoy it to the fullest.  Kudos to Kubrick's genius for making such a unique piece.\", \"Kubrick's's best film ever.absolutely mind-blowing.quite disturbing though but that's what moves us.he has amazingly blended the disturbing scenes with the lovely music of Beethoven.a riveting journey of a vicious young hoodlum in modern England who is caught due to the betrayal of his friends and his journey through aversion therapy that drives him to try and do himself in and his cure at last.i never thought i would understand and really appreciate this film but i did and i say that it is one of the best films of the century.Kubrick has excelled himself and i truly feel it is his best film ever.it also has an absolutely mind-blowing performance by young Malcolm Mcdowell as Alex,the best acting performance i have seen.\", \"Clockwork Orange is definitely the most bizarre film I've ever seen. The whole idea of brainwashing a criminal to never do harm again in itself is genius. Stanley Kubrick amazes me with just the music he picked for the movie alone. I was hooked from the opening scene! But, I did find the movie rather disturbing at some points, with the violence and rapes. But the story just made me look past it, and concentrate on the movie. In my opinion, its one of the most brilliant pictures ever made. But, you really have to look past the things you might find disturbing, and just concentrate on the story.\", \"Without a doubt, my absolute favorite film of all time. I first saw this movie three years ago and I have been in love with it (and Stanley Kubrick) ever since. I never get tired of seeing this movie. Why it remains so underappreciated (at least by \\\"casual\\\" movie viewers) is beyond me. Everything is great; acting, direction, cinematography, the sets, everything.   Something that I don't think anyone else commented on was the Russian motif. The names of the droogs (Alexander, George, Peter, and Dim...short for Dimitri) are decidedly Russian. The singer referenced in the record store, Johnny Zhivago, has obvious Russian overtones. The statement made by the Minister of the Interior about the \\\"peace-loving citizens\\\" is a direct reference to the name that Soviet government representatives applied to their people when talking about the Cold War. Red seems to stand out from other colors. And, of course, who could forget Nadsat, the Russian slang language? I wonder what Burgess and Kubrick were trying to suggest about the future of Ingsoc (those familiar with \\\"1984\\\" will understand)?\", \"I haven't read the novel that this film is based upon, and I didn't know that much about it before I sat down to see it. I decided to see it after hearing pretty much nothing but praise for the film(in fact, the only negative comments I've ever heard about it is that it deviates too much from the original novel... which is something Kubrick was famous for) and because I immensely enjoyed The Shining and Kubrick's directorial style as seen in it. I must say, it's been quite a while since I saw something so full, spectacular, exhausting and powerful. From the very first frame to the very last... amazing. Kubrick's style is magnificent, his storytelling is among the best ever seen in cinema. With this film he truly captures the raw and pure qualities of violence. I don't think(well, I certainly don't hope) that anyone who ever has or ever will see this film confuses this as an ode or a tribute to violence... this is not, in any way, shape, or form glorifying violence or violent behavior. Quite the contrary, you might say. The film proves, once and for all, that violence spawns violence. Visually, the film is absolutely stunning. The angles, pans, tracking shots... fantastic work. The ideas presented in the film are more than enough to disturb and freak out any normal person... which is(at least part of) the point. If I mention the words 'eyes opened forcefully' you probably already know what I'm talking about, right? That famous sequence has been referenced, spoofed and talked about more times than just about any other visual impression in the history of cinema. The way everyone and everything turns at Alex after he's apparently cured... truly disturbing. I found a surprise at every change in scenery or even in immediate situation, especially in the latter part of the movie. The way society turns against Alex after he rejoins it, apparently a better man... one of the most 'true' and real cinematic truths ever told of humanity. We are beasts, we are what is commonly referred to as 'inhumane'... and Kubrick tells us this in a truly astonishing manner. The plot is very good. It deals with the main character of Alex, beautifully played by Malcolm McDowell, who loves 'a bit of the old ultra-violence'. He is incarcerated and offered a chance to be re-entered to society, after being 'cured' of his psychotic tendencies. The pacing is... well, hard to describe, really... it feels slow, the movie seems to move slowly... but it hardly drags at all. It's exhausting, not to mention hard to sit through, both due to the extreme content and the slowly moving plot, but it's all worth it. The point is pure genius. Pure Kubrick. The acting is flawless... and believe me, that is not a term I use lightly. Every single actor performs perfectly. The characters are perfectly written, credible in every scene and interesting. The cinematography is pure beauty... pure excellence. I've come to love Kubrick's visual style. His cuts of varying speed and intensity, his long takes when dealing with dialog... truly amazing. His use of music is astounding... the use of classical music is great and really adds to the ironic tone and the atmosphere, the mood of the film. This is truly a work of art, and an exhausting but truly worthwhile film. I haven't seen anything quite like it for a while... in fact, maybe I never have. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick or intelligent theater. If you believe yourself to be perceptive and intelligent enough to understand the film on most or all of its levels(I don't claim to, not at all), or even on the most basic levels, such as theme and morale(which is what I understood of it) then you should, nay, then you *need* to see this film. Be prepared, though, it does contain quite a lot of disturbing themes and ideas, and is not in any way for the faint of heart. 10/10\", \"It's funny, after you watch a film many times you begin to fall in love with it. This is true with a lot of films but for Clockwork Orange, I only had to watch it 2 subsequent times to fall in love with it. There are so many elements of this film that bring it together and make you totally enjoy the story. The music in the film is one such example, at times it's beautiful and at times dark and disturbing, setting the right tone for the scene. Technically this is a sci-fi film because it does take place in the future and there is the plot which involves brainwashing. When many people think of Stanley Kubrick, they think of 2001 and this film. It's because this film stands out as possibly the scariest image of the near future\", \"\\\"A Clockwork Orange\\\" starts out with Alex and his gang of \\\"droogs\\\" sitting in the Kerova milk bar drinking the milk plus... Then the camera starts slowly to move back and we see naked female statues and drink machines which purl out the milk through their breasts...  McDowell is splendid as the star-child Alex... He is simply a vicious and amazing sadist monster, lethal in his sincerity, taking delight in rape and violence... Never such a vile character has been so charismatic and attractive...   His life is perplexing, questionable and terrifying... He doesn't show the slightest regard for other's rights or morality... He doesn't even regard his victims as human beings...  His paradoxical character is in nearly every scene... McDowell captures Alex's human and inhuman side with equal skill... Alex is a victim at the mercy of an uncaring society, condemned to the physically unbearable \\\"dislike therapy\\\" and preyed upon by his former targets...  Set in England in the near future\\u0096 a future which vaguely reflects our own, but it seems that society has started to crumble and at night the streets are driven with teenage gangs who run free of parental control...  \\\"A Clockwork Orange\\\" is too strong for some people to accept and is still too powerful today... It is an extremely disturbing meditation on the violent nature of man... Kubrick emphasizes the human element by paradoxically dehumanizing the characters...  Viewers see images they may not have wanted to see, but will never be able to forget... He presents violence in a confusing and increasing fashion that makes it alarmingly attractive... He invites us to join Alex in raping and pillaging into London urban jungle to show that violence and power are invariably attractive... He makes good use of the camera, showing, in strange ways, the furious underworld of Alex...   Kubrick is the driving force behind \\\"A Clockwork Orange.\\\" The film is without exception his picture... He took the novel of Anthony Burgess re-shaping it to fit his own vision... Images and sound pull in different directions, stimulating conflicting emotions...   In a bizarre juxtaposition of often classical music with violence, we see ourselves manipulated into cheering for Alex, despite his brutal and amoral nature... We are forced to really think about the implications of the events with no answer...  The film serves as a battleground for philosophical arguments making comments without forcing an opinion instead preferring that we ourselves decide what to make of the satire... Exposing themes to think about, significant prediction, liberalism of society, sexual acts gaining acceptance, violent films in higher degree, alcohol-currently legal, accounts for many acts of violence, crime out of control, violence in schools, television, illustrating the inconstant nature of public opinion, raising questions, themes and ideas that many people would prefer not to confront...  Style has always been one of Kubrick's strong points... He maintained a reputation for an obsessive attention to detail... He was known for getting the most out of his actors... Distinct images often play a significant part in his films...  With its dynamic bizarre sets and pulsating classical music score, and with a word of warning on how bad violence is and should be watched very closely, Kubrick's motion picture is unsurpassed with intellectual content... It is a film described often as the sociological masterpiece of the decade and, often as dangerously vicious\\u0096 a film with more violent sex and dangerous thugs than any other I can remember, a film which daringly brought to larger-than-life those areas of the unconscious mind which some people felt were best left hidden\\u0085  It is also highly dramatic, extremely graphic, compelling and provoking... It is frightening and intriguing masterpiece with a powerful message about the reality of human nature...\", \"With the sudden death of Stanley Kubrick recently a part of my love for film died along with him as I recognized the unfortunate fact that there was no other director alive to closely heed the call for attention to detail and visceral content. The thought of looking to Steven Spielberg for future answers was almost unbearable as I remembered that his originality often gives way to family fare (The Pinnochio finale of `Artificial Intelligence') in an attempt to pad his already overloaded wallet. I thought about Sam Mendes and cringed as I remembered that for him art was a floating grocery bag with unclever teenagers clamoring around it in `American Beauty.' No one could replace Stanley Kubrick and after the intitial tears I bought his boxed set and tried to make the best out of a bad situation. And it was then that I rediscovered his greatest achievement `A Clockwork Orange.'  What inspired me to watch `A Clockwork Orange' all those years ago was initially it's `X' rating. I knew that mom would have a fit and I had to see why it was so provocative. For the better part of the 1970's it was also banned furthering my desire to see it. I was surprised by the `X' rating until I witnessed the hilarious in-out rape scenes and was somewhat amazed at the blatancy and sheer delight of the slow-motion pummeling of his droogies by the sweet looking but awfully scary Alex De Large (Malcolm McDowell). Upon further viewing a new love and passion grew for the film until I became part of the passionate cult that remains inspired by `A Clockwork Orange' more than any other films on the AFI Top 100 of all time list.  `A Clockwork Orange' was a very sad film for any lawmaker who adores social order and loathes freedom of speech in 1971. The response of lawmakers who banned this critical statement on social order proved their fear by banning it almost immediately though it still managed an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and Best Director and deservedly so. Ironically, Kubrick's most original piece was a witty and insightful adaptation of the terrific Anthony Burgess novel. I believe that Burgess would have loved what Kubrick did with it. There were subtle changes and Alex ultimately failed to become a do-gooder in the film but it was all for the best. You almost never like the movie more than the novel but this is a film where Kubrick works overtime to bring his imagination to the proceedings and the movie is better than the novel.  With every Kubrick film comes the feeling of eating Turkish food. As a principle Turkish food can be presented with a taste that is somewhat unedible. More importantly is the idea of presentation and the experience requires elegance and an amazing contrast of color. This as opposed to taste makes for quality food. Similarly, Kubrick often shied away from telling a fundamentally coherent plot and concerned himself with the details of visual artistry. `A Clockwork Orange' was his best effort on the silver screen because he was able to finally incorporate a fantastic story with the elegant presentation of color, a task that surely kept him at night as he tossed and turned searching for a perfect balance of the two.  What truly makes this adaptation of the Burgess novel a success, is what Malcolm McDowell brings to the screen. He is Alex De Large and you can't help but kind of adore his urgent needs for a little of the old ultra violence each night as he unexpectedly makes his house calls through the neighborhood and pounces on innocent women. You also can't help but appreciate his interaction with his good old mom and dad as a tiny snicker forms when he insists on not being able to attend school and a sad but sweet look of confusion and sadness innocently appears as his parents introduce him to their replacement son and he finds himself homeless and in need of his droogies. His interactions with his droogies are a delight as he goes from `singing in the rain' to a mad villain beating up the little groupies in slow-motion. There is a sense of sadness as he ironically goes from being Beethoven's number one fan to a botched suicide that leaves him with broken limbs abounding but the same clever smile and good attitude. The finale is quite possibly the best ever in cinema as sweet Alex cannot help but think of a little of the old in-out as the nurses attempt to curtail his ultra violent tendencies. The slow smile that appears on his innocently despicable face is a sheer delight. The incredible accent makes it all the better.  `A Clockwork Orange' was a film that was so far ahead of it's time in 1971. The Kordova Milk Bar was a trendy little place we can only picture existing in the future. The fascinating way that his crime was dealt with could be the wave of the future should the capital punishment issue cause too much disagreement. In short, a little of the old ultra violence is what propelled this film to high rankings and what will eventually allow all of us to allow our children to see it, once their 18 of course.  10/10  \", \"Stanley Kubrick has a way of telling stories about violence without actually exploiting them, or going into exaggeration. In DR STRANGELOVE, OR HOW I STOPPED WORRYING AND LEARNED TO LOVE THE BOMB violence as war was discussed, overheard, never truly seen until the final reel when a flurry of atomic bombs exploded into bright mushrooms as the song \\\"We'll Meet Again\\\" lovingly played in the background. In 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY Hal-9000 terminates an entire crew in a most chilling way and all we see is a computer screen indicating the termination of life. Now, in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Kubrick actually brings a story about violence, and even then it is art directed within an inch of its life.  Alex DeLarge is the leader of a band of 'droogs' who move from location to location terrorizing their victims, putting them under outrageous acts of violence. When two of his 'droogs' refuse to follow Alex's path of destruction, he turns on them and beats them, until an act of reversal turns against Alex and he is brought down by the medical industry who decides to \\\"reform\\\" his heretofore sociopathic tendencies. One he is cured, an interesting chain of humiliating events that bring Alex even farther down ensue: he is, for example, now attacked by his very ex-mates, now policemen, and his ex-victims. Sometimes the cure is far worse than the illness. Karma is a bitch.  Kubrick has a particular way of visualizing his films. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE has a look and feel completely out of its time, closer to sometime in the future, and its torture sequence in which Alex is regenerated also looks straight out of a science fiction movie. However, this is not a science fiction film. It's actually quite difficult to categorize CLOCKWORK because it's something of a social satire, something of a drama, has comedic moments and deconstructs a musical for a horrifying rape sequence; however, its approach to the material gives it the feel of a hybrid out of time, out of place, but visually arresting and impossible to take for granted. It's this approach that makes the work the product of a master of direction -- it can be seen multiple times and every time a different perspective arises, and all one can be left with is with the notion that this is pure, ultra-modern cinema.\", \"A Clockwork Orange (1971) is by far one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. The characters are all so interesting that I wish the movie wouldn't end! All the actors do a fantastic job in their roles, especially Malcolm McDowell. The film's soundtrack is also quite great; I recommend that everyone should at least listen to it. The story for A Clockwork Orange goes like this:  Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is a cheerful young man who enjoys rape, violence, classical music, and just about everything sadistic. With his three droogs, Alex spends the nights terrorizing anyone who he might encounter. One night, after killing a woman with numerous cats, Alex's gang turns on him and leaves him at the hands of the law. Alex next finds himself in prison with the sentence of 14 years for his murder that night. While in prison, he hears about a free ticket out of his sentence. All he has to do is be a guinea pig for a scientific experiment. The experiment is supposed to make Alex \\\"better\\\" and revert him from being bad to good. Alex says yes, jumping at the opportunity to get free faster. After being brainwashed by the scientists, Alex returns to civilization as a free and good man. However, the experiment has some side-effects that were not intended, and Alex is left helpless as his past victims come to gain revenge on him.  As I said earlier, the acting (not to mention the soundtrack) is great. With the slew of Hollywood remakes on the rise, I can only hope that they never remake this classic. From the eye-grabbing first shot of the film to the confusing yet fulfilling last shot of the film, A Clockwork Orange remains to be one of my favorite films. Stanley Kubrick remains to this day, even after his death, as one of the best filmmakers of all time. Go and watch this film with an open mind. It truly is a masterpiece. I give A Clockwork Orange (1971) a 10 out of 10.\", \"i just saw this movie about a day ago, and it completely blew me away, namely the main character, protagonist, hero? Alex. we love, hate, and or just plain utterly confused about how we feel of Alex. Alex is the greatest villain ever because he is ourselves, he is the worst of ourselves. hes the deep dark place inside you that rises to the surface eventually, and then pushed down just as fast because it terrifies you. the way Alex stares into the camera in the first scene just freaks me out, he has a little smirk on his face that seems to say you may hate me, but you'll never be rid of me, because there can never be good without the bad, and i am the bad.\", \"This is just possibly the most \\\"perfect\\\" movie ever made. There is no meaningless dialog; not a single extraneous character; and every plot twist is rational and reasonable. Not to mention a superb soundtrack. Because of the intense violence, particularly against women, it is a disturbing and difficult film to sit through. But if you care about the cinema, you must watch without interruption! Characters get what they deserve...in the beginning and at the climax. Let Kubrick take you on the emotional rollercoaster of your cinematic life. And don't forget to breathe.\", \"Few films are as sensational or infamous as Stanley Kubrick's \\\"A Clockwork Orange\\\". It's impossible to sit through ACO and not have a reaction; whether it be shock, disgust or amazement. The savage tale of a brutal young droog and his subsequent \\\"reformation\\\" by the government is as shocking and thought-provoking as ever.   While the film's depictions of violence and sex are what it's most known for, ACO works on far deeper levels. The disturbing portrayal of youth and its satirical depiction of a government's attempts to create a better society are brilliant, but the most fascinating aspect of ACO is the questions it poses about good and evil. While the crimes Alex commits at the beginning of the film are atrocious, what the government does to him is worse. The film presents the absolute worst aspects of man, but shows that even these are still favorable to a man without the choice. People can denounce the film because of its brutal content, but the importance of the questions it poses can't be denied.   Equally excellent to the film's content is the effort by the crew. Kubrick's perfectionism pays off well, as ACO in one of his most visually striking films. Malcolm MacDowell is nothing short of amazing as Alex. Kubrick's use of surreal imagery and set pieces, as well as the ingenious use of music to compliment the on-screen action, creates a world that perfectly reflects the protagonist's behavior and the government's policies.   A Clockwork Orange is by no means an easy film to get through, as many will be turned off by the scenes of violence and rape. But this masterpiece is far more complex than a simple romp through a world of youthful violence. It's a rare example of film-making that demands that the viewer actually think. Real horrorshow all around, Oh my brothers.\", \"A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971) ****  Starring: Malcolm McDowell, Patrick Magee, Michael Bates, Warren Clarke, and Adrienne Corri Written and Directed by Stanley Kubrick 137 minutes Rated R (for strong explicit sexual content and rape, perverse nudity, brutal violence, and some language)  By Blake French:  \\tStanley Kubrick's \\\"A Clockwork Orange\\\" holds the recent record of being the number one film of all time on my charts. The film is everything that you'll never want to watch. The scenes are disturbing, gut wrenching, mind twisting, and way over the top. In result, \\\"A Clockwork Orange\\\" has the most powerful and overwhelming dramatic impact that I have ever experienced in a mainstream film.   \\t\\\"A Clockwork Orange\\\" is the story of a young man named Alex DeLarge, who is, by day, a regular student who lives with his parents at home, but, by night, a homicidal rapist/killer with his accomplices who dress up like demented clowns at a bleak freak show. He and his buddies weasel their way into the happy homes housing innocent people by chanting the same deceiving phrase every night: they scream that their friend has been critically wounded in an accident near by--and plead to use their telephone to call for help.  For a few unfortunate souls, this devious trick proves to be successful in nature. One night, however, a woman known as \\\"The Cat Lady,\\\" refuses their plead, and calls the police in suspicion. Alex, being both smart and sneaky, somehow manages to break into this perverted woman's home, while his accomplices wait outside. Once indoors, a fight begins. A struggle featuring a sex toy owned by \\\"Cat Lady,\\\" one that not only causes panicked arousal, but also is featured as the weapon of her graphic and disturbing murder. Alex quickly flees the scene once the police sirens reach his shaky ears, but when he gets back to his pal's waiting outside, they return their experiences with him by bashing him over the head with a hard object, allowing their jumbled escape, but his certain demise.  After the process of being sent to prison, Alex grows to learn to tell offices and guards what they like to hear. He reads the bible, is never involved with any major fights or complications, and almost volunteers for a new kind of experiment. An experiment so probationary it is still being tested and held under wraps. What it does, though a series of \\\"sessions,\\\" is cure a violent individual from his sickness; he will feel terrible pain if involved in any sort of violence after the medicine takes place.  The scenes involving the \\\"cure\\\" of Alex's disturbances are truly emotionally troublesome. They are so explicit and detailed that I myself felt tempted to look away from the screen at points. This is not a film for those who are prone to walk out of movies, those who are easily offended, or especially for those with week stomachs. This is the most grizzly enumerated film I have even screened, but it happens to be one of the most perfect and precise in message. I definitely don't recommend the production to everyone, though.   The soundtrack to \\\"A Clockwork Orange\\\" is one of the most inspirational and spirited ones I have ever heard; right up there with the turns to \\\"The Graduate\\\" (1967). Although the actual music is far from fitting each individual scene, the overall presence is not only worth listening to, but also worth the purchase price.  Here, a young Malcolm McDowell explores the character of a lifetime with vivid imagination and tremendous description. His character fits him very well as an actor. Even though the character is meant to be despised, I couldn't help but to be very convinced and interested in his sick, demented, psychotic mind. Most of this is because of the flawless point of view the film contains, one that both provokes empathy and involvement. It investigates the mind of a killer, rapist, and a confused, somewhat harmless, adolescent--all existing in the same character. This is no doubt the character, and the performance, that inspired a generation.  As well as being a movie of violent and sexual repulsion, Stanley Kubrick's direction to \\\"A Clockwork Orange\\\" also forces us to investigate deep down in ourselves and chew on the idea of us being in the character's shoes. There is a scene in this movie that forces two parents to make a decision of a lifetime. After receiving the treatments he volunteered for, Alex returns to his household only to discover that the only mom and dad he's even known have rented his old room out to some strange college kid, who is said to have been there for them during many hard times--like a real son. His parents must make a choice: to throw their only son, who has suffered for years in turn for making others suffer, out of the house for good, or allow him to return with open arms trusting that he is \\\"cured.\\\" Well, dear reader, what would you do? Brought to you by Warner Bros.\", \"To say that the Alex character from Stanley Kubrick's \\\"A Clockwork Orange\\\" is unlikable is like saying the Manson family was sort of bad. He's not just unlikable; he's despicable, terrifying, sick, twisted, and ultimately a haunting embodiment of all our greatest realistic fears and worries. But Alex does not see himself as a sick person. The key to this is in his voice-over narrative.  Alex does not see himself as a pervert, just as we do not see our own flaws and Ramond Babbitt did not see his own autism. To us, we are all normal, which is a scary thought.  \\\"A Clockwork Orange,\\\" which was originally released in 1973 after an appeal for an R rating (that was granted after originally being tagged as an X-rated motion picture), had been banned from Britain for close to thirty years. Most film fans in Europe will tell you that they had seen the movie on grainy bootleg videotapes years ago when they were young and curious.  But for those of us lucky enough to enjoy (or squirm through) \\\"A Clockwork Orange\\\" in its entire odd splendor, it is an experience you are likely to never forget. Its characters, its style, its subject matter, its explicit material--all of it combines to create a marvelous whole that will stay with you long after the credits stop rolling.  Essentially a tale focused on Alex's journeys in jail and his process of being re-submitted to the world after inhumane treatments to cure the evil out of him, \\\"A Clockwork Orange\\\" is indeed as offbeat as its title.  All tales of redemption involve characters that we gradually come to appreciate, or like, or--at the very least--learn to tolerate. Not \\\"A Clockwork Orange.\\\" Our narrator remains the same throughout the movie, always an incarnation of everything wrong in today's modern world. He goes through no cleansing process and by the end of the film we like him less than we did at the beginning. That's daring.\", \"Stanely Kubrick's \\\"A Clockwork Orange\\\" is one of the first movies that proved that cinema can be the most enlightening and amazing art form around. Movies have always been a true love for me, but it wasn't until this film challenged me that I fell deeply in love. The first viewing left me speechless, unable to describe how weird and terrible I felt. I thought it was the film that left me in this mood, so of course that was the easy target to blame. It was just a bad movie, overrated and stupid and a waste of time. But upon further thought, I realised the film did exactly what it was supposed to. It showed how the world can be a weird and horrible place, and how this young man who goes around torturing people and being a wicked person ultimately doesn't have to pay for what he does. And it's funny too. So this film brilliantly satirises this world, showcasing pure evil and people who ordinarily do not perform such evil are forced to laugh and observe what we all hate to admit is the truth. It's sick, but at the same time brilliant. And when one gets down to the core, you can't really explain it. It just is what it is. It's real. No one really sees it very often, but it is out there and everyone knows. And no one does anything about it. In essence, \\\"A Clockwork Orange\\\" is the ultimate satire, and one of the ultimate film experiences. It's art, it's life, and in a funky way, it's entertaining.\", \"A Clockwork Orange is the finest film that has ever been made, in my view. Stanley Kubrick has made so many masterpieces, and is by far the best director that ever graced our world. A Clockwork Orange is simply his finest hour!  The film grabs you and glues you to your seat from start to finish. Malcolm McDowell gives us a shining example of superior acting, and the movie is as perverted as any of Kubrick's masterpieces (and then some!). It contains horrifying violence, extreme emotions, perversity and weirdness at it's very worst. It all boils down to serve you a plethora of thoughts for you to take with you and contemplate, after the film ends.  However, with all the perversity bursting out of this film, you will probably NOT like this film the first time you see it. I know I didn't. Fortunately, I gave it a second chance, and thought: Hey, it was actually not bad at all. After the third time, I was lost for words.  After the fourth time, there was little doubt in my mind, that this was the finest film ever made, and regardless of how many great masterpieces I see, A Clockwork Orange still towers above them. I'm sure you'll agree, if you give it the chance it deserves, although it may require for you to see it more than once.  \", \"It's hard to judge a film such as this. Its cold and hard, yet can be exhilarating and sarcastic. It can be average, yet it can be visionary. Exploitive? Satirical? Too many questions to consider when one watches this film.  Even after 34 years, this film still speaks volumes about our current culture, which many ideals are ringing true today. The younger generations are out of control due to lack of parental control, junk culture is becoming commonplace, violence is desensitizing the masses, and we all seem to be enjoying the ride on the way down. It's very difficult to find movies which can make such startling commentary, yet hold on to such accusations for an extended period of time. Nowadays, films are focused-grouped to death, conformity is more powerful than artistry, and money is far more important than quality. Kubrick took a huge leap with this film, challenging society to take a hard look at itself. Unfortunately, society wasn't ready for this film, which is why it is revered now more than ever.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Collateral\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0369339\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Conspiracy Theory\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0118883\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Contact\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0118884\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Cool Hand Luke\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0061512\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Copycat\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0112722\", \"total_review_count\": 4, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"Perhaps one of Sigourney Weavers worst films to date, her portrayal of a criminal psychologist with post traumatic stress disorder grinds from the first scene. Sigourney Weaver plays Dr Helen Hudson, the brilliant criminal psychologist, somewhat reminiscent of Denzel Washington's Lincoln Rhyme in the more recent and marginally superior 'The Bone Collector'. She is haunted by the memory of being attacked by a serial killer and has now become the new unhealthy interest of a copycat serial killer. Holly Hunter plays M.J. Monahan, a tough cop with a distinctly unexplored history. A very shallow character who does little to bring the film to life. The film seems to want to explore the two female leads, though it does so with no emotional attachment for the viewer. I sat unmoved during scenes supposedly trying to tug at my heart strings. Only hinting at the contents of their hearts and minds, a token poorly executed sub-plot does little to open any of these doors. A boring, predictable, unimaginative plot married to over-the-top incidental music eventually leads to an equally uninspired climax.

But both actresses are great.\", \"This was a potentially great, atmospheric thriller wasted by the scriptwriters' inanity and their ridiculous goofs regarding computers. I hate \\\"realistic\\\" movies that make such idiotic errors about computers and they always lose all their potential appeal in my eyes. The writers of this movie have no idea about anything computer-related, and they try to make computers one of the key points of the plot. They would probably mistake a typewriter and a TV set for a computer when faced with those. Their inanity can be seen best when the killer sends dr Hudson an e-mail with a video clip attached. The clip has its own icon and ACTS LIKE AN EXECUTABLE. It has its own code! Great Lord, does a concept of a program seem so bizarre to those Hollywood people that they cannot comprehend it? Of course, this \\\"program-clip\\\" is referred to as a virus, a generic Hollywood name for anything that is not from AOL or Microsoft, even though it is the precise opposite of a virus - not only does it not replicate, but it removes itself. In addition to this ridiculous, ill-informed, annoying idea, Dr Hudson uses a weird, non-operating OS that looks like a bizarre amalgam of X-Windows and CP/M (and Final III from the C64 :), but acts as neither. The pictures \\\"download\\\" and zoom in a strange, nonexistent way, the net access is ridiculously unrealistic... The killer manages to send totally anonymous e-mails and nobody even bothers to trace them - yeah, right. And how does Helen contact him later? She sends a mail \\\"in the open\\\". Just sends it. Without any recipient, without anything. And nevertheless, the killer gets it. Sigh. I would give the movie ten stars. For those computer-related idiocies, I take four stars back, and two stars more for Holly Hunter's annoying voice and the boring, cheaply artificial character of Daryll Lee Cullum, played by a wooden and unappealing actor whose name I won't even bother to remember. This leaves the movie with a final score of four stars. Oops. Tough luck, guys - hire better scriptwriters next time.\", \"This lame movie is strictly Hollywood formula, and tries to ride on SE7ENs success, but without coming within an inch of that movies style and sophistication. The plot is unbelievably far-fetched, the directing bland and unoriginal.

But in fact, it's just a bunch of coincidences between several characters that connect each other during one day in one of the biggest cities of the world. Who the hell is going to believe that? There are unrealistic situations, one after the other. On the other hand, this film pretends to show racism between Asians, Iranians, Latinos, Blacks, and Whites. But the big error relies on a pre-establish racism coming from the writer. Mainly because the White characters in this movie are usually portrait as people with a better social-economical status than the rest of the other races. Iranians are poor, just like the Asians. And Latinos, as always, are portrait as Housekeepers, police officers, or with a very low profile job like a locksmith. Jesus!!! Don't you guys think it's about time to change these stereotypes? Same with blacks, portrait as gang members, with the exception of a Black TV Director, who was the only fresh character for me. This movie sucks so hard, that makes me so disappointed about the kind of cinema coming out from Hollywood these days. Always with stereotype characters. No realism whatsoever. Nothing to identify with. It's simply a big waste because this could have been a great opportunity to show Latinos, Koreans, Iranians, and blacks, from a different perspective.\", \"Given this film's incredible reviews I was expecting something truly exceptional. It certainly starts well with witty and sharp dialogue, and a fine cast in place. A series of Robert Altman-style interwoven stories reel the viewer in with some compelling scenes. I found it gripping entertainment right through to the second half of the film when sadly, it collapses like a pack of cards. A series of ludicrous coincidences and right-on messages stack up until I'm left deeply disappointed and wondering what all the fuss is about. Paul Haggis has tackled the subject of race in LA, and that alone seems to have elevated this movie to a new level of interest. Given that most of the Academy voters live in LA and have experienced racism to some extent, this film is sure to have an impact on them. That means the Oscar for Best Picture will go to the race movie or the gay movie. Let's hope it is the latter, because Brokeback Mountain is a bona fide masterpiece that deserves recognition.\", \"This movie is bad. Just bad. In absolute terms, bad.   The dialog jumps off the screen and slugs you in the face with its thoroughly artificial banter, and then defecates on your ability to detect even trace amounts of subtlety.   Racism is bad. Racism in Los Angeles can be especially bad. I live in the city of Angels, I can attest to that. What is so terrible about the bigotry in Los Angeles is its insidious nature. It creeps at you with a knowing glance, or a swallowed word. Until just at the edge of a full on fist-fight, It almost never comes right out and says, \\\"why did he have to be black!\\\"   I can see quite clearly that the car-jackers are black, the detective's partner is hispanic, the DA is white. As long as there is film rolling through the projector, I can let the visuals, music and words take me to that conclusion without just telling me the conclusion. Characters emote, and we read between the lines to make the connections and conclusions.   That is a partnership and trust between filmmaker and audience. That trust is raped by this movie.   A good film pulls you in directions as an audience, and it steers you with cues to drive to a point. This movie beats you down with its point and insults you and your intelligence along the way. My unanswered question is, why did we as a society say collectively, \\\"thank you?\\\"\", \"Okay, it was very good...but Best Picture? Please, not even close. Munich was better, Capote was much better, Good Night and Good Luck was much better...Brokeback Mountain - well, that should have won! The Academy voters seem to act like the current day Democrats - please just a little of everyone, but don't dare take any concrete positions. That's why we have a complete moron in office in the US.  This has been the WORST AA presentation ... and forget 1987 ... since way before that. Hollywood is so afraid of it's bottom line, that it can't be set \\\"straight\\\". Many voters apparently didn't even see Brokeback Mountain. Get real and get with it.  This was the most pathetic year since I have been watching in the mid- 60's and I was only two.  Wake up, whoever you are. Hollywood IS mainstream, and that's what happened to the Box Office in 2005. King Kong, the last Star Wars film, another Batman film, a re-make or whatever of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, and much more to come in 2006.  At least there were original best pictures, i.e. Munich, but heard that one before, Capote - great; Katherine Keener should have won, even though now we know Reese can sing like a Cash/Carter, etc., Syriana was a much better picture than Crash. That film has been done, since the early 1960's and we have to make that the best film? What a horrible Oscar night and a horrible year to end with in 2005 and another boring year in 2006. At least the BAFTA for best picture went to Brokeback, and what about the horrible song that won? Pathetic. I think we only have about 20 years left as America or the USA, before someone comes in and changes up things a bit. Maybe it will be China since they own so much of this country ... or India, because they have all the high-tech jobs and are the largest democratic country in the entire world.  America has become the land of the fat, the pathetic, and the stupid. Trash can be found in more places than Florida, West Virgina, South Dakota, and in the mid-West.  Drive-through a local McDonald's or Burger King for goodness sake. Order all you want until you get a heart attack. Put yourself out of your misery.\", \"i had gone to the movies expecting to see a great film based on all the word of mouth and terrific reviews. the minute the opening sequence started i knew i was in trouble. the music and credits were trying so hard to evoke emotion i wanted to puke. all i got from this film was clich\\u00e9d characters, contrived dialog and an unemotional script. director/writer Paul haggis' has managed to get great reviews with his manipulative, self righteous writing, but it doesn't fool me. some performance were good. don Cheadle is always good. i think Terrance Howard is slightly over rated but he was decent. ludicrous was way too on the nose. he should stick to rapping. Brendan Fraser was fine. Jennifer Esposito left no impression what so ever. i find nothing interesting about her. Sandra bullock is always the same in every movie, she's just okay. Matt Dillon was very good and i enjoyed watching him work. Ryan Philippe was good as well. but as far as the script and the lousy directing- this is actually one of those movies that is so annoyingly bad i actually took the time to write about it. i would not recommend this film to anyone, what a waste of time.\", \"Through its 2-hour running length, Crash charts the emotional anguish of its 10-odd ensemble of characters when faced with the sometimes blatant and sometimes latent forms of racism underlying in American society. That and the emotional anguish of one of its audiences sitting near the front and desperately trying to make sense of what movies have become these days.  The era we live in has become so complicated. Not only do we reject modernism, even the not very enthusiastic flag-waving of post-modernism ideas is always being shot down by what, post-post-modernism that aims to destroy all these ideas, all in no part thanks to the great destructivist ideas of those great 'thinkers'. But I digress. This has nothing much to do with the what the movie is about, but rather what the movie is.  Sure, it seems hard to earn a living in a Hollywood that has to cater to a market that is so post-post-post everything that cynicism has become more than just a motto in life. It has become part of everything we do and part of everything we think of whether we like it or not. And so a new studio product is born! Indie films, which once were energetic and idealistic in its defiant experimentalism now seem to be as equally adamant as Hollywood films to sell to indie film markets. An indie film must sell at Sundance before becoming 'acclaimed'. And so nothing is simple anymore. Even what constitutes a good film becomes so murky. Whereas in the past filmmakers just wanted to entertain people and tell a good story--and in these seemingly simplistic attempts the greatest of films are borne--filmmakers nowadays have to make films that are good first and foremost; films have to make people think, have to be meaningful, has to be provocative, raise questions, yadda yadda yadda. What it all boils down to, is a subversion of the Hollywood movie system, but this subversion seems strangely similar to the formulaic similarity of Hollywood films, the countless ways of differing to essentially be the same product.  And I haven't even begun on the film yet. Maybe I've become too picky on films I see these days. Maybe it's because of my primary need to be entertained, rather than, say, be probed when seeing a movie. But hell, this movie is one big load of crap. And I'm repulsed by this movie not just because it follows the How to Make a Good Movie Good 101 guidebook to the T--characters spout eloquent lines and are sooo witty like they're gifted with the speech of God; it raises issues about racism and life confronting racism in America; it has 'touching' moments where everyone discovers more about themselves and more about other people; not to mention the fact that once you hear the ambient/new age soundtrack of women singing in high registers in foreign languages, you know you're in for all of the above traits.  And something about the aforementioned point--about it raising questions about immediately-compelling issues like racism--pisses me off big time. Like all post-post-post-post-post everything movies, it doesn't contend with just having a message about this issue. Because oh, our audiences are much to intelligent for that these days in this post-post-post-post world. Our audiences want us to make them think, doesn't want us to put things so simplistically, (and then they will go into existentialist crap and say) that's because life itself isn't simplistic. Ha ha ha. What other common drill do we here then the audience need to think about issues rather than have them fed to them. Okay, okay, and okay. So the film makes it a point to pound the audiences with these non-messages and since they're not exactly a message, it's so decidedly subtle and subtle means good right? So we're being hit again and again with this well-written subtlety with the eloquence of rhetorical prose. And as if the irony is not steep enough, we have Ludicrous' character, the only character who seems to not take all these racism discussion bullshit seriously, being 'converted' into one of those irritatingly meaningful characters where he learns something in the end, giving meaningful looks and pauses where audiences are supposed to 'learn something about themselves too'. Um, yeah. How I wanted to see an incredibly racist film right after this man.  To cut the long bullshit short, I guess I wouldn't have taken issue with the film if it wasn't so bloated in its self-importance. The angst that forms the entire movie felt more like white-boy whining than actual Spike Lee-ish anger. It's so Tim Robbins and Sean Penn, the type that wants to wave flags about humanitarianism when the only thing they don't realize is the flag they're waving is their hole-ridden underwear. Plus it's become so trendy in the post-post-post-post world to be completely subtle about it. Nothing is simple any longer. In its best efforts to actually be good, provocative, and ultimately human, it's become neither, imho, just another indie crap from an indie director that wants to make a name out of himself as a credible indie-filmmaker. Now at least Hollywood is more simple and sincere in its manipulativeness.\", \"'Bland' is probably the word I'd use to try and start describing this film. I only watched it because it had a good rating on here and i was SO let down.  Basically the film is about racism in a post 9/11 America and the director went at it with a sledge hammer! There was no subtlety in the film at all and it felt as though they were trying to achieve a kind of Magnolia feel to the film - which is never a good idea as that film was three hours of tedium and confusion only for it to start raining frogs at the end...  All in all a HUGE disappointment.\", \"This movie was offensively PC, predictable and clich\\u00e9d. I couldn't imagine a movie that better exemplifies the myopic, narcissistic preachiness of today's Hollywood. If you haven't seen this don't bother watching it. If you have, show some courage and tell people how awful it really is. My wife, a minority in her own right, was offended by the inherent and unendingly racist message of the film. This movie has nothing to do with the real world and has little, if anything at all, to add to any discussion about racism in this country. Instead, it's the kind of cheap, sensationalist crap that is promoted as deep and challenging thought. What kind of a bubble do you have to live in to think that this is at all impressive?\", \"Crash is overwrought, over-thought and over-baked. A great example of how to make a pompous and self-important film with a message. Haggis tries too hard to make his point and overreaches in just about every category of the film. It feels very much in love with its own sense of social relevance and has all the subtlety of a jackhammer to the skull. Sure, race relations affect everyone and there's a great deal of ambiguity to the issue, but the universe of 'Crash' operates to suggest that we are all victims to our own perceptions on race. It's a tiresome thread that repeats itself ad nauseum and wears out its welcome within the first 30 minutes. I found the outcomes of the characters unsurprising and forced and the film took forever to sputter out and die. The fact that this film is in the top 50 movies on IMDb is a testament to the public's willingness to get suckered by Hollywood malarkey.  Indeed, if you want the real \\\"Crash,\\\" go check out the one by David Cronenberg: dark, twisted and original. This film plays as preachy, tiresome, and masochistic.\", \"Terrible writing, highly contrived, from a \\\"do-gooder\\\" who knows absolutely nothing about race relations in L.A., or the USA in the present day. The gushing positive reviews are a mystery to me - but could only be provided by folks who think that someone's \\\"good\\\" intentions should be applauded regardless of how shallow, simpleminded and just totally unrealistic the results are. If you want to see a film which deals realistically with modern day L.A. race issues - the movie you need to see (and probably already saw) is Pulp Fiction. There's more honesty and realism regarding race in any two minutes of that film than there are in the full 4 hours (oh I'm sorry, it just felt like 4 hours) of this stinker.   If anyone ever needs proof that the path to hell is paved with good intentions - then this is the movie for you.\", \"THE GOOD: The acting were great especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor instead of Matt Dillon.  THE BAD: I'm a visible minority (non-white) and I have experienced some form of racism in my life. BUT despite my life experiences and the movie's subject matter, I would definitely NOT say that this movie is the best of the year, in fact, it's FAR from it. I have problems with this movie both from a moviegoer's perspective and from a visible minority's perspective. Some of my problems with this movie are:  (1) Poor character development (or none at all). Just because we saw extremes in a character, for example, Matt Dillon being a racist cop and being a good caregiver to his ailing father, that does not mean in any way that the character is well-developed. Yes, I admit that in a big cast ensemble like in this movie, it is quite difficult for every character to be well-developed, BUT that does not mean that at none of the characters should be like that.  (2) The dialogue seems really contrived to the point that I'm really surprised this movie won for Best Original Screenplay. They should show this movie in a screenplay writing class NOT because it's good but to show students and future screenplay writers what NOT to do. I just felt like I've been hit by the head over and over again how bad racism is. I get it.  (3) The plot seems so coincidental, it is laughable. What are the chances of a black car robber running over an Asian guy who also happens to be a human trafficker while entering his van, and that same black car robber ended up carjacking that Asian guy's van several hours later after he brought him the hospital, only to find out that the several Asians being trafficked inside the van just to show you that the black car robber has a good side after all? Or, what about that scene where a prejudiced upper-class white woman who fell down the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred vanished into thin air? If it was THAT simple, why don't we throw every racist in America down the stairs so they will have a change of heart?  (4) I think my biggest misgivings about this movie is the unrealistic view of racism. As someone who has experienced racism in my life, the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face. I've been refused to enter a supermarket because I'm not white. Did the store owner said because I was not white? No, he said the store was closing even though there were a lot of people shopping inside. Did he yell racial slurs? No. Racism in America is more hidden. Some cab drivers probably won't stop to pick you up because you're non-white but that does not mean that they will try to run you over or get out and say racial slurs. If a Chinese woman rear-ended me, I won't be saying \\\"blake! blake! Learn some English bitch!\\\". On the other hand, if I was a Chinese woman and I accidentally rear-ended a Mexican woman, I won't say \\\"Mexicans are bad drivers\\\" in front of her face. That's not how things work. Instead, I would give out my insurance info, say sorry, and go home and tell my fellow Chinese friends and family that Mexicans are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. That is the real racism. It's hidden and not in your face.  Anyway, Crash is not original unlike what some people may say. The interlocking and interweaving story lines, plots, and characters have been done before. \\\"Magnolia\\\" is a movie that does this much better than Crash did and yet, it was never nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. It had a stellar cast -- Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who won best Actor recently), Tom Cruise, etc. It really boggles my mind how Crash was even nominated for Best Picture.\", \"What a disappointment. The story line is so simple - \\\"the good guys sometimes do bad things and the bad guys sometimes do good things\\\" - dressed up into a racial setting to make it seem clever, sophisticated and meaningful. It isn't. It lacks any subtlety.  Everything that happens is telegraphed and then gone over again in case you missed the explanation.  For a film like this to convince and move the audience it has to be represent the ambiguity of the characters and their motivation and actions; not simply present it as a series of 180 degree changes in each character's actions.  Half way through I really wanted to waste no more time on it, but I thought I would stick with it in case it improved; big mistake I should have stopped then - it simply got worse.\", \"i am amazed anyone likes this film. i never walk out of movies, but my friend had to physically stop me from leaving the theater during this insulting disaster. the white characters are saints and the Asian characters are practically nonexistent and worthless to the story. they exist only as objects, surprise. characters of other races fare much better. the twists and turns were laughable and predictable. but if you're reading this, you know that already. Paul Haggis is a hack. Hollywood can't even do multicultural movies right. do yourself a favor and watch a much more honest take on race relations, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle!\", \"I wrote this as a two part review. Part two has spoilers.  Part 1:   No, this isn't that one about the sex with car accidents. This is the one about racism in L.A. You know, the one where everybody is a racist, and race is the topic on everybody's mind at all times. Race.  Its like the movie has a form of turrets syndrome where race is the constant theme. Race. Racist. Racism. Race Relations. Relay race.  Paul Haggis made a movie which took the structure of Magnolia, which was used to show the disconnect of people who are tangentially connected, and then screwed it into a 1'53\\\" mental vomit about racism in America. RACE. In the 24 hour period we have 7 stories running parallel all connected and about race. The first hour, people say ridiculous stuff and do absurd things in an effort to be real about racism in America.  For example, the story with Ludicrous and Larenz Tate provides the comic relief. Too bad, the first half of their story is lifted straight from The Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction. RACISM. Their section is the Quentin Tarantino section where, instead of being cool and talking about foot massages and religion, the characters talk about race and racism. CONSTANTLY.   The other good thing about it is the Mexican story when the Mexican guy is talking to his daughter. He gives her his invisible impenetrable cloak to protect her from bullets. Decent writing, but that's only because the writers have had daughters and know what they would say in his place.  The rest of the stories are extremely ludicrous. The Hindi does not act in any semblance of realism. The scene where he's trying to get the lock fixed and the Mexican tells him he needs a new door is abbreviated and stupid. Why would anybody act like that? Is it realistic? NOOO. It reminds me more of the convenience store clerk from The Doom Generation. \\\"Six Dollar Sixty Six Cents girly.\\\" If i ever watch the second half of the movie, I hope his head is shot off and his bodiless head starts coughing up relish.  I haven't mentioned race in over a paragraph. RACE. RACISM. RACE FOR THE SUN. Better. Then, there is the black guy who wants to be white, Matt Dillon who has a chip on his shoulder against blacks, Ryan Phillippe who looks beautiful and does nothing, and various other bad actors acting badly with bad dialog. When Matt Dillon molests the black producers wife, could I help it if I was cracking up? When Philippe is second guessing his writing up of his partner for racism, can I help but crack up? The movie is so funny when it is being racist. Racist. RACIST I tell you.  Now, mind you, this movie was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Editing, besides a nod to Matt Dillon who actually did attempt to do a decent job. Who was paid off for that one, I have no clue.  Don't see it unless you feel like being preached at about the racism in society through a bad and unrealistic script from 2 white men over fifty who have no semblance of reality or interaction with real society in any way shape or form.  D-   Part 2:  The second half of Crash takes any and all story lines in the first half...and spews them back out in a sort of redemptive, conclusionary, the world is a big coincidence kind of way. And it is in fact one of the worst ways to do it.  Take 1999's Magnolia. People weren't conveniently tied together over and over again. They were just connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. You know somebody who knows somebody who did something that you knew somebody else was also involved in. Crash takes this wrapping into a serious extreme.  The stories are lined up so everybody meets again. Are there only 5 on the LAPD force? Aren't these people working weird shifts? Dillon and Philippe were a late shift then an early one the next day? And, why did Tate have to be the murdered hitchhiker? Wouldn't it have had more emotional tension, as well as realism, if it had been somebody we had not been following all day long? Like Phillippe just picks up a random hitchhiker and then freaks out. Everybody'd be freaking out.  Eventually, in the second half, the touching invisible cloak scene is used to get the Hindi to shoot the daughter. It ticked me off and made me feel dirty. Not that the Hindi shot the daughter, but that they created a beautiful touching scene and then had it be the direct cause of people tearing up. It really ticked me off. At the writers, not the scene.  The whole movie is fake and totally uncalled for. The coincidences are far too many and they require an extreme suspension of disbelief. Unlike Magnolia which was connected mildly, this had connections upon connections upon connections which were just so over-the-top. The only good part in the second half was when Sandra Bullock falls down the stairs. She doesn't die though. She should have. I cheered when she fell.  The worst part about the movie is it pulls a Magnolia. Not just in structure, but it has a montage over the song In the Deep where you see everybody being depressed. Magnolia took this and had post-modern commentary on it by having all of the characters singing along to Aimee Mann's Wise Up. Unfortunately, Magnolia came out in 1999, while Crash came out in 2005. Its hard to make commentary on a movie which won't be made for another 6 years, but it happened. Somehow.  Utter waste of my time.  First half: D-; Second half: lowest grade ever; Overall: F---\", \"I can not believe the positive reaction to this movie. I had great expectations for it and was disappointed. First of all, they used every cheesy racism clich\\u00e9 in the book. It was so predictable. For instance, from the second the young Latino guy showed up you just knew that he would be a really nice guy because he looked like a gangbanger. Matt Dillon's character has been played a million times, a cop who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some degree by the end of the movie. The predictability hardly ended with those characters. A phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script. The morals of the story were PC to the max. There were a few clever twists but not nearly enough. The dialouge was embarrassing at times. It wasn't all bad.I just can't believe this movies high score so far. It was somewhat entertaining, just a little insulting to ones intelligence. I admire what this movie was trying to achieve but it fell well short.\", \"*** SPOILERS***  One of the worst films I've seen since last years \\\"The Village.\\\" An insult to anyone of any intelligence at all. Poorly written and astonishingly contrived. Nobody, especially in Los Angeles talks the way these characters do. No subtly at all. If the point of this film is to say that \\\"we all have a little bit of bigotry in us\\\" he does a horrible job of stating the obvious. Not only was his point clearly base, but every character in this film was AMAZINGLY STUPID. The car jacking scene almost made me walk out, along with the rescue and oh lets not forget the WHITE off DUTY Rookie COP picking up a hitchhiking black thug and... I could go on and on. Awful, just awful.\", \"I agree with what so many others have said about the shallow and offensive nature of this film's examination of racism. It is baffling to me that so many people seem to have been fooled by its pretentiousness. I want to comment on the Matt Dillon character as an example of what's most infuriating about this movie. Here we have a man who -- contrasted with the film's underlying message that \\\"we're all a LITTLE racist\\\" -- effectively rapes a woman in public, cruelly humiliating her husband and deliberately goading him to make a move that, as he well knows, will lead to his arrest or even death. He does all this after pulling the couple over without any legal cause but because, as we come to understand, they are black and wealthy and he is a hurt little boy who is now the police and can therefore do as he pleases. This behavior is not a LITTLE racist. This behavior is evil. It is disturbing to me that this extreme of racism is held up next to another character's behavior -- spouting her paranoid stereotypes about gang violence -- to illustrate that everybody's a LITTLE racist. Later, we're spoon-fed some tripe about Dillon's poor old dad and how black folks drove him into the poor house. Is this supposed to explain, or worse, excuse this behavior? And is Dillon's character meant to redeem himself by committing the utterly unmotivated and unbelievable, laughably coincidental act of saving the woman he sexually assaulted the very night before? Please. The fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of self-congratulatory admiration for this film makes me feel sad about the shallowness of our understanding of racism, and our apparent lack of commitment to condemning and ending it.\", \"The film's tagline is \\\"You think you know who you are. You have no idea.\\\" I reject both the suggested idea that I have no idea who I am and the inferred suggestion that this film tells me who people truly are. If people in real life are really like this, then man, we're screwed.  A bilious film that I walked into late and left prematurely. A film which is so wrapped up in its goal of becoming The Race Film of All Time that it loses sight of the very tools a film must use.  The rules of Hollywood are such: if you show something in the first half, it must be used in the second half. Thus the gun that the daughter worries about her father buying will somehow find its way into the story in the second half. The rules of Hollywood are to make dialog 'real' - a concept which changes with every decade. Is this 'real dialog' somehow less ludicrous than the 'real dialog' of Kevin Smith ten years ago? The rules of Hollywood state that we set the scene, and as action rises, the camera moves in closer to the faces - in this film primarily so we can see the supposed shame, humiliation and transcendental realism of the characters. The strings increase, the frame-rate slows down, and our heart is meant to break.  This film is as crassly manipulative as it is vapid. I have my own prejudices against L.A., which I freely admit, so to combat this prejudice I will not say that this is a natural situation stemming from the location, but rather probably from the author and director. The writer, Paul Haggis, already showed a taste for polemics over humanity in his Million Dollar Baby, which at least had a director who understood how to make the vision of the film bring out the best of a script's ideas. Now that Paul Haggis has his own hands on the camera it becomes obvious that not only does he not know how to write true, natural human drama, he does not know how to photograph or direct it as well. Paul Haggis comes from the land of TV, let us not forget: the land of diminished expectations.  Everything is as obvious as a TV-movie, simply presented for simple minds - Haggis drills into us, over and over again, that while on the surface people may seem to be awful, they have secret pains hidden. This is a nice idea, but so hamfistedly presented that the whole juxtaposition of bad/good has an amateurish feel. Structurally the film is broken up, in the tradition of Magnolia and other earlier films. The editing is as typical and conventionally \\\"cinematic\\\" as could be - if there is a dramatic movement, such as a door opening or a car driving past between the subject and camera, the editors use that extreme movement to give the cut that occurs there a more kinetic quality. The problem is that other than the drive to keep things moving, there is very little intelligence and thought behind the cuts - everything is kept by the books. Not only are the puppets of this hideous racial punch and judy show ineptly handled, but even the curtains are lowered and raised with incompetence.  The film tries desperately to present reality, but there's just no talent whatsoever. Some of the actors are good, some of the actors are bad, and all of the performance get muddied together, brought down by the low, low aesthetics of the film. We have cinematography which is technically clear: we can see the scene, we have a clear understanding of what is happening. However, not only is the cinematography unremarkable, but it is thoughtless camera-work and framing which believes that it actually is inspired. The result is little stylistic flourishes which one recognizes but do not actually add anything to the drama or pathos. For example - and this is a spoiler - as a father holds his dying child (the father might be shot too, I didn't stick around to find out) the camera sees his face and gives us the famous Vertigo track/zoom. The Vertigo shot!!! It was at this point that the film became hysterical and I just had to leave. I had to leave because it was so bad. I left because I was in the middle of a crowded theater, and I wanted to express to the audience that I was sick of emptyheaded Hollywood 'art' which is full of sound and fury, yet signifying nothing (in the Bard's own words). I hate to waste such good Shakespearian references on something this remarkably bad.\", \"I saw this \\\"movie\\\" partly because of the sheer number of good reviews at Netflix, and from it I leaned a valuable lesson. Not a lesson about ethnic diversity however...the lesson I learned is \\\"Don't trust reviews\\\".  Yes, racism sucks and people are complicated, but the people who actually need to see this movie are going to be the ones who are the least drawn to it and least affected by it if they DO see it. The only reason that I can think of for the number of good reviews is that it's being reviewed by people who aren't used to thinking, or who've seen their first thought-provoking movie and somehow think that Haggis invented the concept. In fact, he basically made this film, which should be called \\\"Racism For Dummies\\\", as emotionally wrenching as possible, seemingly to give people who don't spend a lot of time thinking the impression that they've discovered some fundamental truth that's never been covered in a film before. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintanence it's not... An after-school special for the unthinking masses, cut into bite-sized overwrought ham-fisted pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection.  It's as if they portrayed everyone as being the worst possible extreme, simply to make us happy that we're such good people because we don't identify with the characters. Let's face it people. NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes). It's well acted (even if the dialog is atrocious) and cleverly executed, so much that you don't think to ask \\\"where's the beef?\\\" until you can tell the film is winding down. The flaming car scene was well executed, like much of the movie, but went nowhere in the end.   The messages are very heavy-handed, and from the \\\"behind the scenes\\\" blurb, the producers were clearly watching a different movie, because there is very little to laugh about in this movie, even during the intended funny parts. I have to stress that this is NOT entertainment, more like a high school diversity lesson...call it the \\\"Blood on the Highway\\\" of racism. They could even show this in high schools if it weren't for the \\\"side-nude\\\" shot of Jennifer Esposito.  In this film, everyone's a jerk and everyone learns a lesson (except for Michael Pena who gets the best role, but the most predictable storyline).  This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.\", \"I get the impression that I was watching a different movie to the majority of other people I know who have seen this film. It's not really that I found the film offensive or anything - just that the script was unbelievably amateurish for a film that had obviously had a bit of money thrown at it. I really respected Paul Haggis' work on the Million Dollar Baby script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was. It was clear to me that it was desperate to be the 'racism' version of Traffic, but I don't think Traffic was really a film worth ripping off in the first place.   The worst feature of thisfilm is the way it shamelessly spoon-feeds its audience. Does Haggisreally think we are so dumb as to require a shot of the blanks? Do wereally need to see the phone book sitting on Farhad's dashboard, withthe address circled in black texta? Can we not be left to make someleaps in logic for ourselves?   I also had a major problem with the dialogue which was so 'on the nose'. I have heard one critic say that the quality of dialogue is deceptively high, because even though people may not speak this way, they certainly do think this way. That is irrelevant. It is the job of a script like this to utilise dialogue in a way that helps add to the characterisations and believability of the (in this case highly implausible) situations that are set up. These characters all speak using the same voice and all they ever talk about is racism.   Surely the purpose of a film like this should be to promote the fact that race should not really be an issue in these situations, but by making it the sole focus of every scene, doesn't it become innately racist itself? Characters walk around spouting their philosophies and conveniently memorised statistics on race relations as though they're regurgitating extracts from the research essay they've just written. It's utterly unconvincing and obvious.   A film should reveal its meaning gradually, not slap us in the face with it in the opening scenes and then never let up. I can see that Haggis' intentions with this film were honorable, but dare I suggest that by directing his own script he has not been able to identify and, therefore, overcome its flaws. I really hope that writer/directors will be really careful in future when approaching this 'mosaic' style of narrative. It has been done well a number of times, but getting the balance between the personal and the political right is very difficult. And Robert Altman will not be outdone in that department.\"], \"review_score\": [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], \"review_category\": [\"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 1.45}, \"Crazy Love\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0790706\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Crime Spree\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0310924\", \"total_review_count\": 3, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"This movie is awful. It tries to be funny and fails every time. You can see where you're supposed to laugh, you know the intention is humor, but it's just not funny. The characters are terribly written. They start off as complete fools and by the end they're devising intricate schemes that come together in entirely ridiculous fashion. But the most painful part of watching this movie has to be sitting through these pathetic attempts at humor.  The next point is this split-screen editing. Some here are raving about it. First of all, it's terrible. Second of all, why even use it to begin with? Brian De Palma used it to tell a story, Norman Jewison used to perfection in the first Thomas Crown Affair. In Crime Spree it just pops up an hour into the movie and then disappears. It's like the editor discovered a new trick on the Avid and then got sick of it before he knew how to use it. Only one of the three splits moved at any given time, the other two were static. What's the point? If you want to direct our attention to the only one of the three splits that's moving, then don't use a split screen.  The director desecrates the masters time and time again. Remember the baby carriage on the staircase scene from De Palma's The Untouchables, Crime Spree has the little girl in the hallway scene, without one iota of the suspense. How about the great Leone showdowns with Clint, Lee Van, Fonda, and Bronson- the close ups of the eyes, the tension before the first man goes for his gun. That's here in Crime Spree too. Not the tension or the beauty, or the sheer power Leone had of capturing the moment and making it last forever, but the close ups of the eyes that say, \\\"Look at me, I've seen The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,\\\" that's there. Then we move to Tarantino, right out of Pulp Fiction, remember when Jules and Vince escape a barrage of bullets miraculously and Jules is changed forever? Well, Crime Spree has that too, without the revelation of course.  And though not a master, Crime Spree also steals liberally from Guy Ritchie as well, right down to the bridge scene in Lock Stock. Not to mention the hole in the door shot.  This director has seen good movies, that's obvious, he's tried to copy them. But he has no idea what makes them good. It's like when these bozos in Hollywood decide to remake the old Twilight Zone series. They give you the shell of the old show with some weird premise, but with none of the depth, with none of the soul of Rod Serling.  There is nothing good about Crime Spree. It's bad on every level, from the script to the editing to the lighting to the directing, and everything in between. I can't believe that of the 260 people who have thus far voted on this movie, that 60 have given it a 10. If I could vote from one to and hundred, I'd give this a zero. It's truly awful.  I just can't believe these other reviews. I think someone's stuffing the ballot box. Anyone who rates this movie anything higher than garbage is suspect.  I rented this and Dirty Deeds on the same night, and although I didn't think much of Dirty Deeds, it's looking Oscar-worthy after seeing Crime Spree.\", \"contrary to some of the comments here-- this movie is not hilarious.  the plot was great, but many of the jokes were wasted by some horrific dialogue and awkward english. the better talents like Gerard Dep. and Renaud's character Zero are largely unused in favor of some bumbling fat guy who was torture to watch....  good direction-- just bad, bad, baaaad acting/dialog and a waste of some good characters\", \"First, be forewarned the makers of this film are ballot-stuffing.

The setting, being at a spooky farm in the country along with the mysterious meteor from the sky that brings inexplicable destruction are a classic setting for a good horror film. Some of the effects may leave something to be desired but the dark cinematography and several of the films more shocking moments give it the creepy element that we are watching a very dreadful scenario unfold.   I would say, that this is one of those films that work best when being viewed, home alone, late at night, with all the lights out, preferably on Halloween.\", \"And more importantly, who the hell cares?!?!? When a film boasts in HUGE letters on the cover that it stars somebody you've never heard of, be skeptical.  So, why do all these ultra low budget film makers have to torture poor H.P. Lovecraft stories? I mean, is there any excuse for it? I put forward that , no, there is not.  This little diamond of poop managed to rope Sheriff Lobo and Luke Duke in to it's crap-trap. And wow! They got Will Wheaton (so?!?).  Okay, it was based on the Colour out of Space (sort of), so, being an HPL fan, I had to get it. Well, I got it....I even went in skeptical, and knowing it was a lame 'un, but still was disappointed.\", \"This being director David Keith's first directorial effort I was willing to be a little forgiving in it's production. After viewing the film I now understand while he has gone on to only direct one other movie, he's not very good. Even so, The Curse needs a lot of fixing up in both direction and editing just to get to mediocrity. The biggest problem is the flow of the movie, its feel is very rough as it jumps from scene to scene. This could be fixed with establishing shots.  For example when Wil Wheaton's character views the Orb on the second night. We have a shot of Wil looking out his window, cut to a shot of the Orb outside, cut to a shot of Wil outside, looking at the Orb. How did he get there so fast?? A way to fix this is to have Wil looking at the Orb, get up to leave the room (to establish that he's going to go look at the Orb) and then cut to the scene of the orb, then cut to him looking at it. Doing little things like establishing shots can make a movie look a lot more professional.  But as I said even if this was done the film would only be mediocre. Claude Akins and Wil Wheaton do as much as they can with the script they are giving. In my opinion only Cooper Huckabee performs above expectations and Kathleen Jordan Gregory gives a fine, if a bit over the top, performance as the mother, the first person to be infected. The rest of the cast ham it up way too much. This was probably done so people wouldn't take the film to seriously and therefore they wouldn't notice how bad it was, but they end up just being distracting. John Schnieder is in the movie for his name only, he has very little screen time and isn't very integral to the plot.  The movie does have a couple of good moments, mostly dealing with the mother as she slowly turns into a hideous creature. But they are too few and far between to alleviate the boredom that sets in beforehand.  It is also obvious that the movie ran out of money before it could be completed (or I hope it did) as the ending doesn't tie in very well with the prologue. Granted it doesn't have a \\\"Hollywood type\\\" ending and I give it credit for that but it needed to be done much better.  Overall The Curse is a pretty dull movie and rates a mere 2 out of 10.\", \"A struggling farmer believes God has blessed him when his crops begin to grow substantially after a large meteor lands in his field, dissolving into his soil and water supply after the local doc, Forbes(Cooper Huckabee), pokes a hole in it. The infected water(it's molecular structure altered by the introduced alien substance from the glowing meteor) causes people and livestock to act irrationally, soon turning violent. Hysteria, dementia, violent mood swings, and skin mutations all result from the infected water.The fruit is worthless internally despite looking ripe and healthy externally. The local realtor and city councilman, Charlie Davidson(Steve Carlisle) woos a TVA water employee, Willis(John Schneider)hoping to get a contract for building a dam in their community.  Poor Zack(Wil Wheaton) has to rough it on his own once his mother, Francis(Kathleen Jordon Gregory) becomes \\\"under the weather\\\" and his sister(Amy, Wil's sis) is assaulted by manic chickens, as Nathan(Akins) and his antagonistic jerk son, Cyrus(Malcolm Danare), both even worse after being infected, torment him through insults and harsh treatment..you see he's not their blood(..his mother married Nathan, it seems, because they needed support he could give) which means they feel little pity or affection towards him. Nathan is a hard, strict, bible-quoting fanatic who doesn't want anyone \\\"butting in\\\" to matters he considers private, even if disease and death spread because of the infected water, or what's evident before him, the fact that his family are afflicted with a plague.  Tolerating Claude Akins for the duration of this film proves to be difficult because he's such a loud and repugnant creature you just want to see suffer in the worst possible way for the problems he causes. And, Wheaton is certainly easy to sympathize with because he's caught between a rock and hard place, little wiggle room to remove himself as madness evolves all around him. Of course, those involved in attempting to cover up something which could prove harmful regarding future prosperity will get their just desserts. Some really spine-tingling make-up effects showing what the mutations and disease cause to humans(and particularly the fruit and cattle)such as opening wounds bursting forth maggots, slimy puss, and beetles! The climax, as the house literally begins imploding while sinking into the earth, is a bit too much. The hideous nature for which causes mother Francis to deform into a ghastly monstrosity is really potent stuff. I'm sure Akins and Danare's fate will be met with applause. I do consider The Curse a success in regards to how it can effectively make your skin crawl, but other than that, I find this rather foul in all respects. It seems to suffer post-production problems, in script particularly, as characters vanish, while others make such preposterous choices which could cause irreversible results(..not to mention a ridiculous ending which leads us to believe that nothing was done in regards to the crisis of the film, written off as no threat or danger to the communities surrounding the farm whose soil and water could cause a national outbreak).  This is part of a series of films unrelated to each other.\", \"At first, Zach (Wil Wheaton sadly of Star Trek: The Next Generation fame) and his sister are the only two people in a very religious family that suspect that the meteor that recently fall from the sky is affecting the water in detrimental ways. However when the animals start acting crazy and the humans shortly following suit, the devout father begins to think it's God's curse for his wife cheating. As if that wasn't enough the family also must deal with a real-estate developer who wants to buy their land.  Any Star Trek fan who wants to see Wheaton get a beat down (most likely all of them) will enjoy this film in parts (I must admit those parts were a bit cathartic for me. Other than that slight recommendation, this is just a sub-par B-horror film with laughable special effects. Maybe good enough for a rainy Saturday afternoon, MAYBE.  My Grade: D+  MGM DVD Extras: no real extras, but it comes with \\\"The Curse 2\\\" on Side B\", \"The Curse (1987) was a film that was loosely based upon the short story \\\"The Colour from Outer Space\\\". This seminal horror/science fiction prose was written by the master of horror H.P. Lovecraft. The problem with adapting his original material is that the film makers tinker with success. Whilst a few directors such as Stuart Gordon and Dan O'Bannon have been successful in translating his stories for the silver screen, most of them are pure nonsensical tripe that's best avoided (except for John Carpenter's trilogy of the apocalypse that captures the aura of Lovecraft perfectly).  The Curse had all the makings of being a decent film. But the director and writers just don't fully understand the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Dumbingt down the man's work for a pedestrian horror film just doesn't cut it. Whilst it get's an A for effort it get's an F minus in execution. Bad acting, sloppy direction and lousy dialog dooms this movie from the get go. Better luck next time.  Not recommended, unless you're a H.P.

Of what, though? Ah, that is not so difficult a question to answer.  Alex Proyas is most famous for his rendering of The Crow, a noir-influenced comic book adaptation turned bloodfeast. Its rough, canted hues and heavy silhouettes focused that work into a study of the virtues of revenge and the vices of redemption. Fast-forward four years, and Proyas sheds the inbred angst in a quest to reinvent science fiction. What he has created is mature and frightening, a singular vision that should rightly be compared to such films as Fritz Lang's Metroplolis and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.  The plot begins with an introduction by Kiefer Sutherland: the Strangers, an alien race, are all but extinct, and in order to prolong their lives they are studying humans in hopes of unlocking the secrets to the eternal soul. Sound cheesy? That's because it is -- but then again, so was \\\"Blade Runner,\\\" with its replicants' difficulties grappling with a conscience. John Murdoch is the object of their obsession for the duration of the movie, as he has achieved the ability to \\\"tune,\\\" meaning he can reshape the physical world purely at will. But Murdoch's memory is murky -- he doesn't know whom to trust, if anyone. All he knows is that he needs to get to Shell Beach.  The plot is pretty straightforward, simple and uncomplicated. But this movie is not self-contained like, say, The Matrix was; this is not a plot-driven hypothetical. Dark City is a vision, a cinematic language of noir imitating sci-fi and vice versa. It is complete in that it is a thorough visual treat: ominous, foreboding set pieces loom; and cityscapes blend and diverge. It is a world wholly unique yet still hauntingly familiar. It is a chamber drama, marrying existential paranoia with hardboiled mystery.  So what kind of masterpiece is Dark City, really? A visual masterpiece? Certainly. But it's more than that. It's a reimagination of our world, and a new way to contemplate the dilemma of humanity -- as I heard it put in a song recently: \\\"Do you know where the self resides/ Is it in your head or between your sides?\\\" Proyas doesn't pretend to know or give the answer, but it might have something to do with Shell Beach.\", \"Perhaps one of the very first films in the age of DVD to find its audience following a poor theatrical run, \\\"Dark City\\\" is the follow-up to director Alex Proyas' other stylistic achievement, the graphic-novel adaptation, \\\"The Crow.\\\" In the film, our main character, John Murdoch, wakes up in a dingy hotel bath tub, bleeding from his forehead. Scared and confused, he comes to find that he is the suspect in a string of brutal murders and hot on his tale is a mysterious organization known as the Strangers, who oddly resemble the cenobites in Clive Barker's \\\"Hellraiser,\\\" but whom have the ability to warp the world around them.  Like \\\"The Crow\\\" before it, \\\"Dark City\\\" is heavy on set-design, bleak atmosphere and memorable visuals, but thankfully, the script (co-written by David S. Goyer) is smart enough not to hinge on special effects and set design, and rather, toys with your expectations while delivering something stream-lined and efficient, instead of being overly long and bloated like it very well could have been. Driving the film is Rufus Sewell as Murdoch, a character who is never sure if what he is seeing or doing is even real. While Sewell sells it, his co-star, Jennifer Connelly, unfortunately isn't given much to do other than look good and sad. Thankfully performances by William Hurt and Keifer Sutherland inject some energy into the narrative, only to bounce off of the underplayed humanity on display by Sewell.  While \\\"The Matrix,\\\" released a year later, would overshadow its influence on the science fiction world and pop-culture in general, it's worth noting that the film still stands as one of the best genre films of the 90's and begs to be seen by anyone with a love for sci-fi in need of some refreshment. It's perhaps the best film by Proyas, and at a breezy 96 minutes, it gets the job done well, never wasting a moment or sacrificing exposition. Even if you're not sold on its plot, you'll at least be mesmerized by its visuals, which in and of itself, is worth the price of admission.\", \"You could say this movie was a precursor to The Matrix, but its better than that. You could say this movie takes its cues from Bladerunner, but it would be more accurate to say it got those cues from Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. You could say this is the best sci-fi movie ever, and I would only put up a token argument. Throughout the film there is an incredible amount of tension. The special effects are amazing (especially for 1998), and somehow it never bites off more than it can chew. The plot is daring, complex and filled with twists, but in the end it completely makes sense. There were so many times when this movie could have fallen apart, devolved into nonsense, but it always holds together. The acting is great, the visuals are great, and the script is great. What more could you want?\", \"Science-fiction done well is always enjoyable. Such is the case with Alex Proyas' \\\"Dark City\\\". The writer, co-scripter and director, Proyas has given his film a real boost by adding strong dramatic tension and a menacing thriller element. He blends all the ingredients well, and provides the perfect mood for the feature.  George Liddle's production design is superlative, well captured as it is by the camera of Dariusz Wolski. Music is from Trevor Jones.  Rufus Sewell does very well as the bewildered Murdoch, a man who has no idea who he is or what is going on in this \\\"Dark City\\\". Kiefer Sutherland is a treat (perhaps his best role) as the psychiatrist who appears to hold the key to Murdoch's past and the secrets of the city. William Hurt sadly gets too little to do as the fastidious Inspector Bumstead, while Colin Friels plays the borderline psychotic \\\"Frank\\\" with glee. Also starts Jennifer Connelly as Murdoch's forgotten wife, and Aussie stars Melissa George and Bruce Spence. Great to see!  The only thing Mr. Proyas does not prepare us for is his rather over the top finale (perhaps a little overkill there), and his all too neat denouement. The conclusion only slightly taints what is otherwise a thoroughly enjoyable production.  Friday, October 30, 1998 - Astor Theatre StKilda\", \"I've read reviews of \\\"Dark City\\\" in many places (and many of them here) hailing it as a modern science fiction masterpiece, so boy was I disappointed when I watched it and came to the sober conclusion that it's just not very good. Yeah, yeah, yeah the visuals are stunning, blah, blah, blah, but as is proved time and again, visuals alone can't make a movie. At least this had an interesting story, but as befalls so many films in this mind-bending sci-fi genre (and \\\"The Matrix\\\" suffers from this as well, though it's a far better movie), the writers have set up such a cerebral concept that the movie grinds to a halt when it has to trudge through all the exposition just so that the audience can keep track of what's going on. Though that in itself is never very clear in \\\"Dark City.\\\" This movie just rushes from one scene to the next, in an attempt to create a breathless and exciting tone I guess, but scenes aren't allowed to play themselves out. We're on to the next set piece before we've had time to absorb the one we just saw, and the characters get buried underneath all the furious editing. However, I don't believe there would be much chance for them anyway, since most of the actors aren't very good either. Rufus Sewell and William Hurt do o.k. but Jennifer Connelly phones in a wan performance and Kiefer Sutherland is barely watchable in a lamentable impersonation of the creepy Nazi chasing Indiana Jones in \\\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\\" His line delivery is so eccentric and monotonous that I was cringing every time he opened his mouth by the film's end.  No, I'm afraid the majority is out to sea with this one. This film and \\\"masterpiece\\\" don't belong in the same sentence.  Grade: C-\", \"The problem with science fiction anymore is the increasingly unoriginal concepts that are up and coming. Instead, remaking or reinstating old classics. Not so, the case with Dark City. Probably one of the most overlooked films of our time, Dark City tells the tale of a man who wakes in a world with no memory of what is going on around him. In essence, we are in the same boat. He goes through searching for clues and trying to survive the touch of the Strangers, a race that houses more purpose to these people than they could possibly know. With the help of their human doctor, they conduct experiments. Our hero jumps in to not only understand them but to free us all. Your first thought in seeing this movie is probably, 'Wow, how similar this is to The Matrix.' With exception to the fact that it came out before The Matrix ever graced it's previews, there are similarities. I have said many times to people, this is how the other two should have ended up. Hey, if your going to take something, may as well take it all. Anyway, moving on. Dark City is brilliant. The action sequences alone are suspenseful, and to this day I watch and pick up new things. Note that there are spirals throughout all of the film. Also, the acting. A good sci-fi must perpetuate good acting in order to sell this fiction as a possible reality. To start, Rufus Sewell, a fine thespian indeed. Not only does he sell the newborn man, but he also makes you feel a certain sense of sorrow for him. Next on the plate is the ever great William Hurt. I can say that I've only seen a handful of films he's been in, but anytime I do, he is phenomenal. Dark City is no exception. He plays the inspector, bent on finding a killer but realizes the case has nothing to do with this life. Next comes Kiefer Sutherland, a fantastic choice for this film indeed as the Igor mad scientist. What you come to find out is that he is helping the enemy because he has no choice. The work Kiefer does with his voice takes you to a different thought process of who it is, making you feel sorry for his character more than Sewell's. Fourth down the line comes the lovely Jennifer Connelly, now an academy award winner, and rightfully so. She shines as much as she can in this sci fi feature where she plays a smaller role than people think. And last, but certainly not least, comes Mr. Richard O'Brien. He redefines what the term evil villain means. His vocal work, though not sure if it's his voice or an imitation, is superb. I can't go a day without thinking of high pitched voice as he spouts the line \\\"We use your dead as vessels\\\", and then a snarl. All in, one of the better films in history, I would definitely place this on my top ten list.  10 out of 10.\", \"Dark city is one of the most original pieces of sci-fi to come along in a long time, add that to the amazing visual look brought to the film by it's director and you have a body of work that is little short of perfect. Alex Proyas may not direct many films but when he does he gets it right. It's a shame then that Dark city did not get the full recognition it deserved, I myself watched it on it's opening weekend in the uk, in cinema that had no more than six people in it. When you compare this with the box office success of a film like the Matrix which while being a good film still falls well short of the tale being told in Dark City, it seems that people on the whole don't want intelligent science fiction but the typical pap that hollywood is too eager to churn out for the masses. We need more films like Dark City and Twelve Monkeys and we need more directors who belive that their audience has a brain and is willing to use it.\", \"What an astounding, absorbing, tour de force! Happened upon \\\"Dark City\\\" on cable TV in the wee hours as I was about to go to sleep -- and right from the start, I was mesmerized by this amazingly brilliant, darkly thrilling, gothically mysterious excursion into the labyrinthine nature of existence. One of the most outstandingly creative, intelligent, well-crafted philosophical filmic SF journeys in decades! Even though I found the very ending to be a bit week (though passable) and tangentially inconsistent with the visceral flow and power of the film as a whole, I heartily recommend \\\"Dark City\\\" to all those who thrive on a challenge to the imagination and have the courage to question the darkness in a quest for the light.\", \"This is the one of the best Sci-Fi movies I have seen in recent history. The way everything is meticulously placed is incredible. From the lighting to the characters and the city itself. With an incredible jaw dropping reveal at the climax I cannot recommend this movie enough.   The pacing is great and starts fast and ends fast. There are pauses in the action I believe Alex Proyas placed there to give the viewer a chance to catch his breath.  Roger Ebert named this the best movie of 1998, it may not quite be that, but nonetheless, you will not be disappointed.  Check it out I am sure you will love it.\", \"A truly riveting movie. A great film that causes you to think about its implications rather than spoon-feeding you plot. The special effects (while spectacular) never encroach or overtake the character development. Also the only movie where Sutherland doesn't play a biker type.\", \"For all of those who have been misguided and praised The Matrix as the greatest scifi movie(though i rather call it junk), you have been lied too. The Matrix is actually an overbudget, over-rated, and over-produce version of this classic, Dark City. The special effects, unlike The Matrix, make sense in this film. They not only please the eyes, but they make the mind think. This is not eye-candy junk. This is the real thing. A film which knows no boundries and does not add a nonsense storyline to it. It is sad to see people flock to The Matrix and over look this more original picture. You'll see sequels of The Matrix, but you will not see sequels of Dark City, because it is art. Brillantly scripted, Brillantly acted, Brillantly directed. This is the real sci-fi thriller we've been waiting for. Not since 2001: A Space Odyssey, has a sci-fi film made science so powerful and exciting. As for The Matrix, it made it dumb.\", \"My words will be few. I feel this is one of the truest forms of science fiction that I have seen in a movie. It is dark and strange yet very much deals with real issues. This movie should leave the viewer with much to think about. A truely great movie. I have been waiting for it's equal.\", \"Reading through the reviews of this film, it's clear to me that the general viewing public (the folks who don't get this movie) really does like its action films to be big and dumb, and that they have been fooled by Hollywood into thinking that: a) \\\"science fiction\\\" is the same as \\\"sci fi\\\" (it's not); and b) \\\"science fiction\\\" is now supposed to be analogous to \\\"action flick\\\" (thanks for nothing, James Cameron!).  The same people who will not attempt to think about (I don't mean \\\"like,\\\" I just mean \\\"think about\\\") the second two movies in \\\"The Matrix\\\" trilogy are going to hate this film, because it is truly a science fiction film and not an action movie or a \\\"sci fi\\\" movie.  For people who want to think about their entertainment, this is a great film for you.  The things people are missing are because of the fact that they don't want to pay attention.  Why are there Strangers in the form of little kids? Because the Strangers inhabit the human dead and, since children can die, the Strangers can inhabit their bodies.  Can't the Strangers do anything? No, clearly they can't because, if they could, they wouldn't need the doctor for his work with humans. They clearly have limits to their powers.  Why are the characters so wooden? Because they aren't comfortable with themselves. John is comfortable with his power at the end of the movie because he has grown comfortable with himself and who he is. Bumstead and Emma seem distant at first because they are only just introduced to those lives when we first see them. They have memories of being those people, but they are not those people and they are not yet comfortable in their skins.  Again, this is a very deeply made film. You have to dig deep to discover what is going on. The Jungian themes, the emotional themes, the questions of self identity and how society, such as a city, can inform our identification of not only ourselves but those around us are set here for us to think about.  So, in short, if you want a film to pay attention to and think about, this is your flick.  If you want a big, dumb action movie, then go elsewhere - there's noting (for you) to see here.\", \"This is a movie you would love if you love the Matrix movie's concept. Well, the concept remains same but not the action which makes Matrix one of the most watchable sci-fi movie of this decade. This one does have clean cinematography though, with okay acts by Rufus Sewell, Kiefer Stherland, William Hurt, Jennifer Connelly. If one is intrigued by the mystery of our very existence then this kind of movie is surely going to provide some food for thought. If one day you get up and find that everything around you is just a big lie and the whole world surrounded you is fabricated, manipulated then what will be your reaction. In this one like Keanu in Matrix, Rufus also possesses the power of the changers, somehow lacks the brightness, smartness of Matrix. However all in all this is a watchable movie, just don't expect and compare with Matrix.\", \"Imagine there's no heaven. Imagine a hundred minutes of pure atmosphere. Imagine a hundred minutes of raw science fiction. Imagine a hundred minutes of psychedelic cinematography. It will be called Dark City.  Probably the most overlooked movie of the 90s, Dark City is comparable to the likes of Blade Runner and the timeless Metropolis. It is a different from Blade Runner because the plot is more a picture in the puzzle than the puzzle itself. The classic sci-fi plot has been setup like a detective story. The story starts in true film noir style with a man wanted for a series of brutal murders. But he cannot remember whether he did them or not. In fact, he cannot remember anything. Thus starts a tale of discovery and a wonderful hundred minutes.  What makes sci-fi movies fun is the transportation of the viewer into its world and Dark City does this well. For quite some time in the movie, the plot unfolds like a crime story - but slowly and creepily leading into its sci-fi elements. And when it starts, its a lot of fun. The Strangers start chasing Rufus. They find out much to their surprise that Rufus can also 'tune in' like themselves. And then there is a kid with superpowers and has a couple of interesting encounters with Rufus. And the unforgettable Jennifer Connelly. For once in a movie she is being sought after and plays the ing\\u00e9nue to perfection, unlike most of her famous ventures where she is nursing crazy protagonists. Her memories are mixed up by the Strangers and she does not remember who Rufus is. By the end of the movie, Rufus has to start wooing her again. Nice.  What makes Dark City Dark City is the atmospheric canon of light and darkness. Dim lazy sets. A confused but determined Rufus Sewell. The creepy Strangers. Its a work of great imagination and packed a wallop when I watched it in an empty theater 6 years ago. Maybe this impact is what Manoj Night Shyamalan was talking about in order to stop studios' plans of releasing the DVDs of movies on the same day as their theatrical release. If somebody saw Dark City on DVD today they might never understand why its so good a sci-fi movie.\", \"John Mudoch (Rufus Sewell) awakes in a bathtub completely naked, with blood dripping down his forehead, unaware of what is happening, he remembers nothing. In the next room he finds a dead body and a blood stained knife. What follows is john trying to piece together what is happening to him and what he unravels is one of the greatest science fiction stories ever put to film. There is a group called the strangers who have an ability to physically change surroundings of them and the people living in the city, they call this ability \\\"tuning\\\". They soon discover that john also has this ability, which is impossible as it would take a normal human a few lifetimes to gain the ability to \\\"tune\\\". Thats the most i can tell without giving away major plot points.  The movie is set in a 1940ish looking city where detectives are hunting John, along with the mysterious strangers. The tall buildings and the knowledge that the strangers could be anywhere in the city gives a menacing ambiance, heightening the tension in the movie and giving off a great effect on the viewer. The special effects in Dark City are stunning and realistic, especially when certain characters use \\\"tuning\\\".  Rufus Sewell gives a good performance as John Murdoch, though i could'nt help feeling he was holding back somewhat. I could think of a few other actors who could have gave a much better performance but he was generally good.  Kiefer Sunderland as Dr. Daniel Schreber was very good and seemed to have put all of his effort into his character, its quite an unusual role for Sunderland but he pulls it off pretty well.  Another performance worth mentioning is Richard O'Brien as Mr Hand, he gives a genuinely creepy performance as one of the main strangers, i thought i would see him and think crystal maze through all of his scenes but he does a pretty good job of playing a convincing character.  Overall the movie leaves a few unanswered questions, leaving the viewer to conduct their own theories about the outcome of events. I have a good grasp of the story as a whole but some people will find bits and pieces confusing. A great film anyways, i gave it an 8 because it tends to drag in some spots, but the end makes up for all doubts.\", \"First, just for the record, this film did not rip off 'The Matrix'. It came out a year earlier. Such arguments seem pointless to me anyway, since the basic premise both of these movies, plus 'The Thirteenth Floor', 'The Truman Show', 'Pleasantville', et al are so blatantly appropriated from Philip K Dick's SF of the 1950's.   Never mind that, though. This is another \\\"What is reality\\\" film (a question Dick apparently used to pose himself every morning); this time the variation being that an alien race has abducted a city of humans and is performing experiments on them to try to find out the nature of the human soul. That isn't a spoiler, BTW. In fact the very first thing that happens in this film is that the narrator tells you what I just told you. You can't help but wonder if it might have served to achieve a better sense of mystery if they hadn't thought to lay that on you in the first 30 seconds, but the film manages to be quite suspenseful all the same.  'Dark City' is directed by the bloke who brought us 'The Crow', which I thought was utter rubbish. It has a similar dark, stylised look, which will probably appeal to goths - but in 'Dark City' there is at least a reason for this perpetual night.   'Dark City' is SF, nominally, but the kernel of hard SF which mostly emerges (quite pleasingly) at the end of the movie is subsumed by the complete stylization of the movie's visual elements. There really isn't any need for the aliens to all look and talk like Riff-Raff from 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show', for the scary, gruesome, dark sets - for the fact that people are driving 1960's cars around and wearing 1940's fashions. There is no need to have an evil little kid alien, or for the aliens to all chatter their teeth when they do something ominous. You have got get over the silliness of this sort of stuff and appreciate that it's just part of the weird, atmospheric world the director has created. Really it all owes as much to comic book horror and super-hero stuff as it does to traditional science fiction.  'Dark City' is the sort of film which can easily annoy you if you allow it to, but if you can forgive its affectations and the fact that it doesn't even attempt to explain various obvious logical oddities (e.g. why don't people who collapse face-first in a bowl of porridge drown after a few hours?) then the film can win you over as the hero goes through his version of taking the red pill (or was it the blue one? I always forget.)  This film also raises several important questions about Kiefer Sutherland. How come his glasses don't fall off when he's hanging upside down? Why does he speak haltingly, stutteringly, EXCEPT when he's stressed out? Did he just get this job because his dad knew the producer? Fortunately Sutherland's typically ridiculous acting is balanced to an extent by William Hurt as Inspector Bumstead (honestly!) - the cop who's chasing after the hero. Hurt is, as always, almost completely devoid of personality, and looks as if he's in a trance most of the time. Of course he's always like this, but in this movie it actually makes sense.  Rufus Sewell is fine as the hero - the guy who 'wakes up' - and so is Jennifer Connelly as his 'wife'. The aliens are all over the top and silly, and they float through the air and chatter their teeth, but like I said, you have to just think comic-book, and you can forgive it all.  In some ways 'Dark City' is a film that I hate myself for liking, but the truth is it's a pretty darn effective, if somewhat ridiculous SF story, and what makes it work are precisely the things that make it silly. Go figure. 7 out of 10.\", \"This is a tremendous movie I must say! Unfortunately I only got to watch it on a small poor TV, but the style and plot is still captivating.  The strongest point is a very nice style: 50-ish random big city, neither clearly American or European. It is always dark, sun never shines, everything looks a bit run down. Some puddles and rain reinforces the mood.  The start of the movie is wonderful in its total mystery; it is really a whole lot like a Kafka novel as the main protagonist walks around in a strange world discovering ever more of it. And it is really really strange in an absolutely wonderful way.   The basic premise of aliens putting humans in a lab far out in space and messing with their minds is really nice, and the way they do it interesting enough. However, I felt that the movie dropped some in its intensity when the mechanics behind the scenes get revealed. An unseen horror is always more interesting than a seen horror.   The end is a bit disappointing as it all digresses into a \\\"big fight\\\" in classic american style.   But the final end is nice in that there is no complete happiness, only a hint that things could be getting better.   Overall, better than most movies. An 9 out of 10!\", \"Dark City (1998) New Line Cinema.  Review: Dark City being directed by Alex Proyas, who directed the dark thriller The Crow, I had to see this movie. This is an original, dark, engaging, and one of the best movies of 1998.  The story is the best. A man who wakes up in a bathtub has no memory at all. He discovers that some ominous beings are coming after him. Who are they? What do they want? And to top it off, he is a suspect in several murders. As the story unfolds, it just gets more interesting. The look of the city is quite a sight. It has an old school comic book feel to it. The style of everything is a nice 1940's style, from clothing to the cars.   As we follow our hero, we learn more about him....or do we? What is real? What is fake? Questions keep coming up but, are their any answers to all these questions? Even more weird is when at the stroke of midnight, the city changes shape while everyone sleeps.  Our hero is also followed by an honest detective, Insp. Bumstead, who just wants answers to the murders and gets involved in the mystery too. Our hero wants to look for one location that could unlock the mystery to everything. What could it be?   Another strong point here is the acting is excellent. Rufus Sewell plays his role with conviction and passion. The casting is flawless.   The Last Word: Awesome flick. This is a movie that is excellent brain food. It makes you think....a lot. You will most likely watch this over and over again to figure everything out. No problem. This movie never gets old. Highly recommended.\", \"I'm not saying the acting was perfect, i'm not trying to say the story was told in the most professional way or all by rules of film-making. It wasn't at all an up-tempo film Hollywood style with lots of explosions and rapid smart dialogs.  But, somehow, unlike most films with few exceptions, it had the capability of putting you in a certain mood. A mood of inconvenience, because you become one with the character John Murdoch, mostly thanks to Sewell's acting. Maybe it's because when I've seen this movie, it's always way past midnight, but I guess it's part of the ultimate experience from it.  The thing is I've only felt this way about a movie once before, and unfortunately, I can't remember the title of that movie, only that it ended with a picture of an ocean, and an alone man on the beach, leaving us never knowing if he would ever meet his girl again or not. I love when a picture put that enormous hill of emotions in your heart, and just as many questions in your head. That feeling, that mood.  Most of the actors has received bad reviews for this movie, not least on this forum. But in my opinion, Rufus Sewell is doing his part very well. First so uncertain, then slowly growing into his role. Keither Sutherland, in a pretty uncomfortable role as a scared, weak doctor does it surprisingly good. William Hurt is hard and scarred, but soft on the inside. I guess the actors are telling more about their parts than the script itself.   Generally, all the actors seem to have captured this feeling, this sense, that colors all throughout the picture, making the picture. You are not watching it. You are in it. You are John Murdoch.  I'd like to end with a quote  John Murdoch: \\\"When was the last time you remember doing something during the day?\\\"  It sort of reveals the touch of it. If you haven't seen it, see it, in the middle of the night! If you've seen it daytime, see it again at nighttime. Not because you're tired, but because it's dark.\", \"Ever since I first saw the first Crow film with Brandon Lee, I've been an avid fan of Alex Proyas' film making and Dark City is another amazing example of his cinematic expertise. Filmed primarily in Sydney and starring Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connoly, William Hurt and Keifer Sutherland, Dark City is an incredible piece of work with an intricate and detailed story with an even more amazingly executed motion picture behind it. The sets and visual effects have been so well thought out and performed that together with the impressive acting (including many Australian actors such as Colin Friels and that tall funny looking guy from Mad Max) the film simply sucks you in and you can fully believe that the word Proyas has created exists; which is something that not many film makers can achieve easily. From start to finish, an instant classic that will surely gain cult status as the years progress.\", \"\\\"Dark\\\" is right: this is a dark movie with dark people and dark buildings where there is no daylight until the very end of the story. It's a combination sci-fi/film noir and takes place back in the 1940s or '50s in some big city.  It's alien nonsense stuff about peoples' memories taken from them so that the aliens can learn enough about earth beings to eventually take over their souls because their own race is dying, blah, blah, blah. You've seen it before.   However, the story takes a back seat to the set designs and special effects, both of which are unique. I know of no other movie, before or since (it's been eight years), which shows a city literally re-shape itself each night with buildings expanding, rising, falling, etc. The visuals throughout this movie are fabulous and the sounds that go with it are good, too.   There is very little profanity in this movie but it's still an ugly, sordid story and not always fun to watch even though it keeps your attention and - at least with me - draws you back for multiple viewings. There is a magnetism to this film. This is the only video I got rid twice and re-acquired it both times! As I said, Dark City keeps drawing me back. Eerie!!!\", \"Words can't begin to describe the admiration that I have for this movie. Even to this day, six years after seeing it for the first time, I can't get over the freshness, originality, and overall boldness of Alex Proyas' visionary masterpiece. Now that Proyas is getting a larger budget for I, Robot this year, I felt that it would be time to credit Proyas' earlier science fiction masterpiece in anticipation that I, Robot would only live up to this film.   From the opening shots of this film, the viewer is instantly plummeted into a bold and grand setting of an indistinct city that seems that this is how noir films of the forties would look if they were in color. After a display of the bizarre occurrence that happens to the city around midnight, we are introduced to the film's protagonist, a man named John Murdoch, who awakens in a bathtub, with no memory of his life or how he got where he was. Needless to say, what happened to the dead woman next to his bed. After a few clues that seem to trigger brief glimpses of his childhood, he is chased from his room by three odd looking figures, looking for him.  As Murdoch wanders the city, trying to find his identity, we learn that not only are the strange people (who are appropriately named The Strangers) looking for Mr. Murdoch, but a police officer named Bumstead is as well, searching for the killer of not just the woman in the apartment, but six other women who were murdered in the same manner as the woman from Murdoch's room. Also is Murdoch's estranged wife, who is trying to make a reconciliation with him after a falling out. Even a therapist that Murdoch has been seeing because of his wife's infidelity is searching for him as well. Everyone seems to have their own reason to be searching for Murdoch, and Murdoch is trying to figure out why, since he has no clue as to who he is. In a sense, Murdoch's quest becomes a search for identity in a world that is trying to label him. Is he a murderer, is he a jilted lover, is he psychologically damaged person, or is he a like the strangers who are pursuing him?  But that becomes the center question of Dark City itself, do we make up who we are or are we made up of experiences and memories? We realize this question when we realize the purpose of the Strangers' inhabitance of the city. They are actually aliens, whose race is dying out and they need to observe the human race to see what has made us thrive so much. So, we enter their experiment, which revolves around making the inhabitants of the city fall asleep at midnight while the strangers give them new lives by implanting new memories in them and changing the environment around them.  Murdoch also discovers that the reason the Strangers are coming after him is because he has developed an immunity to the experiment, not falling asleep when everyone else does. He has also begun to take on the traits of the strangers as well, gaining their power to \\\"tune\\\", which is the ability to alter their environment by will alone. This whole concept suggests two things, the first being that humanity has the ability to adapt and thrive in a new environment and the other is that as an individual, humans have the ability to shape their world to their own desire once they are fully aware of themselves and their desires.  The movie in itself is a brilliant commentary on our society as a whole which is displayed in the beginning with Dr. Schreber's rat experiment in the lab, which comes to symbolize a smaller scale version of the strangers' experiment for us, putting rats (humans) in a maze of a city (life) and seeing if they can find their way. Which also seems to suggest that as a society, we are merely just rats in a maze, wandering around until we come to the end. The strangers' insistence on doing everything as a group also brings up another interesting point about the human race is that our ability to be individuals is what makes humans thrive rather than conformity and similarity. \\\"Dark City\\\" takes such bold and brilliant concepts, suggesting so much about our society as a whole and even the importance of individuality over conformity. The themes, once read into, take on such a strong and complex turn, unheard of in most science fiction films of recent years.  Then there is the matter of the setting itself, for no science fiction film can be complete without a strong and symbolic setting. The setting is vast and detailed, and this isn't just the city, which is a sight to behold in itself. The underground world of the strangers themselves is claustrophobic, atmospheric, and actually is the most alien in architecture, suggesting a twisted, surrealistic world, yet one that is dependent on the world above them. The city above ground displays a rich noir feel in which one feels that there is something sinister lurking underneath it's surface. Even the blending of the time periods, seeing 30s architecture around 60s cars driven by people in 50s suits is even a hint off that the city has been fabricated out of different eras and pasts as one of the strangers even seems to suggest.  \\\"Dark City\\\" is a film rich in ideas, concepts, visual splendor, and atmosphere. It's the kind of film that one seems to enjoy being lost in, despite the danger that lurks in it's atmosphere. It's a film that reassures it's viewers that a strong understanding of oneself and staying true to yourself that one can conquer any world they are placed in. And as I, Robot approaches, one can only hope that lightning can strike twice with Proyas and his unique blend of visual grandeur and his depth will emerge and be embraced by a larger audience, who might seek out this film.\", \"This is probably the best Sci-Fi-Film of the Ninetees. Matrix is good, but this film is better. Both deal with the same question: What is reality? Not only was Dark City first, it also handles the subject much better and more adult than Matrix. Also its conclusion is far better than the one of Matrix.  Not only does this film deal with reality, it also deals with humanity, something which lacks Matrix. What makes us humans? To quote Dr. Schreber from the film \\\"Are we more than just the sum of our Experiences?\\\" This film is slowpaced, but not boring at all. And it deserves the title: Dark. The film is dark, \\\"noir\\\" and this gives the film a great atmosphere. The darkness and coldness of the strangers is in contrast to the bright light of the sun created by John Murdoch in the end.  This film is very philosophic, which I like. The best films are those which help us to think and this one clearly is such a film. Something which is needed in our society of marionettes and idiotic consumers who know more than anyone else before in history but who lack the ability to truly think.  The show down was a little weak, but the film made this up again at the very end with the last meeting between Murdoch and Mr. Hand. I remember Murdoch's words well and he speaks of a truth which is sometimes forgotten: What makes us human is not to be found in our heads, our brains and our minds.\", \"My age: 13  John Murdoch, played by Rufus Sewell, awakens in a bathtub in a hotel room, not remembering anything about his past and discovering that he is wanted for a series of brutal murders. He receives a phone call from Dr Schreber, played by Kiefer Sutherland, who wishes to help him, and leaves the hotel. He begins to have memories of Shell Beach from a postcard in his suitcase. He has no idea what is going on in the dark city. The strangers are another species who live under the ground and search for the human soul. The strangers have the ability to tune, to cloud people's minds and make them sleep. John finds that he is the only person who can resist this power and use it himself. Every night the strangers put the whole town to sleep, imprint people with new memories and change the appearance of the city. Detective Bumstead, played by William Hurt, is on the murder case, trying to bring John in, but is then caught up in helping John uncover the truth.  This film is visually excellent, especially during the scenes when the strangers are changing the city. I look forward to future work by the director Alex Proyas, whose directing style is brilliant in this film. Acting performances are very good, and the film has an interesting and intriguing plot. The characters are well thought up, and you really care about them. The film is great from start to finish, but the film is best in the end, with a showdown between the main stranger and John. One of the best films of recent times, Dark City deserves to be called the Number 1 movie of 1998 by Roger Ebert.  Australian Classification: M 15+: Medium Level Violence  Rating: 88 out of 100\", \"If you like mind twisting movies that stick with you for days/weeks and make you question the human existence and our reality as we know it, then DARK CITY is the film for you.  Similar in philosophy to the later released 'The Matrix', the film is centered around a man (Rufus Sewell) who becomes suddenly and unwittingly aware that his world is not what it seems. The film kicks off with Murdoch (Sewell) waking up in a bathtub with no memory and a dead body in the same room. He has no recollection as to how and why he's there.  As Murdoch attempts to put the pieces together he notices that at every midnight on the dot, apart from Murdoch himself, every inhabitant in the city falls asleep. It's then that he realizes that something even bigger than his memory loss is taking place.  Alex Proyas (The Crow) manages to combine a tantalisingly interesting Sci-Fi screenplay with dark and drab yet beautifully mysterious cinematography and he pulls it off (once again). Although a box-office flop, it has managed to, through the years, collect and maintain a cult following which is well deserved.  It isn't without it's faults, Rufus Sewell although adequate, doesn't steal the show (much like Keanu), and the talented co-stars (k. Sutherland, Connelly & Hurt) aren't utilised as well as they could be. The story does become slight complicated and a little ridiculous at times, but which Sci-Fi movie hasn't suffered from that affliction?! To summarise, think of 'The Matrix', minus the big name stars, special effects and hype, and multiply the philosophy and mystery by 10 (without complicating it, like the Matrix sequels did) and you end up with DARK CITY.\", \"Dark City is the best film of Alex Proyas. He uses the Gothic and claustrophobic themes commonly and dark colors prevail during the film like \\\"The Crow\\\" .The story doesn't follow a certain order of rule, instead there is some mind games and puzzles in the film, that causes watchers to be active in each minute and motivate to the movie..  The topic is about a man who loses his past and first finds himself in a bath tub, doesn^t know about himself and his life, but he has one ability that no one has, he can be alive when the evil forces stops the time and reshapes the world according to their own demand. The story is so fantastic and Proyas' nightmare world come true in that movie.  I can basically say that it's one of the best science fiction movies ever made, it opens doors to different dimensions and force human brains' capability....  \\\"Mutlu Bahar\\\"\", \"Dark City is all about a man who has incredible powers but doesn't realize it. Everyone is under the control of mysterious 'strangers' who are injecting them with false memories/altering their reality. This man (Rufus Sewell) finally confronts these men in a battle for the city.  This is one of those films that inspires you to learn more about sci/fi. The whole movie is cold, dark and it never lights up for a minute. This movie is an underrated brilliant sci-fi film and it bares a resemblance to 'The Matrix', but was made before it, so there is no denying that Dark City must have been an inspiration for The Matrix.  The story is complex but develops itself as a frequently entertaining thriller. It is thought provoking, which is a lesser thing you'll find in films today. You'll sit there thinking about life after viewing this film. It can easily been our future if we head down the road we are on.  The performances are all very good, specially the three lead men. Rufus Sewell plays the confused lead, William Hurt plays the film noir detective and Kiefer Sutherland is the quirky side switching doctor. Don't forget Jennifer Connellywho plays the role with great expertise. Alex Proyas much like The Crow has created this Gothic world where the sun never rises and inhabitants live in darkness. The sets and costumes are beautiful. The acting is top-of-the-line, with Sewell in the lead part. Everyone does a great job.  The villains in this film, THE STRANGERS, are creepy and will send chills down your spine every time you see them in their long black coats and hat. The costumes for them are perfect and could not have been done better, they live in the world underground and you see the different lifestyles between them and the people they control, yet live above them.  The thing that amazed me the most would be the cross between the 1950 to 1980's, it was brilliant, the set pieces were perfect for this film. Every time I saw the buildings changing, I was in amazement. Everyone that took part in this film should be praised, this is a film that should get more attention from the general public, but is overshadowed by films that like to put more action then story in it's plot.\", \"I will be part of the rabid throngs of people lining up to catch a spectacle as huge as Reloaded and Revolution. Despite(and maybe because of) Matrix sky high hype right now, my thoughts drift back to this overlooked classic...but a little on Neo and gang first below...  The Matrix just happened.  With an uncanny midas touch, The Warchowski bros launched this(then unknown film) at the the right place, in the right time. With an execution commercial enough to bring in the box office moola and a philosophical subtext accessible enough for the general public to latch on to, the rest, as they say...is history.  The philosophical under pinnings though, (of blue pills, red pills, the subreality of consciousness and all that mambo jambo etc), so successfully popularised by The Matrix, was infact neither originated by The Matrix nor as fully realised than in other more accomplished works.  Which leads me to....drumroll.....  As such, IMHO, the best execution on the concept of reality and perception was already explored in a much more unbelievably visual opus, one year earlier, the grossly overlooked, criminally under-rated,  \\\"Dark City\\\". (One of My Top 10 All time Favourite Films)  This scifi/ film noir hybrid was impactful both cinematically and ideologically. Most importantly, it rewarded my wildly abandoned reach for human imagination and thirst for ideas, by fulfilling as much promise a motion picture can ever hope to give.  On top of that, my background as a \\\"trekkie\\\" scifi nerd meant I instinctively respond to films which challenge me both intellectually and spiritually. Dark City was thus a near religious, life cleansing experience for me.  And any which way I look at it, this film soars to heights unseen since 2001: A Space Odyssey...  But due to its messed up(or near-absent) marketing campaign(positioning the film to resemble a horror film for the teenage crowd), the film did not find its intended audience and flopped unceremoniously. Of course it found its audience but by then its was too late...  That said, the thirst for something better than our run of the mill pop corn fare is still there, waiting to be quenched.  And The Matrix filled that void.  Too bad it wasn't this film. But in a ideal world, it would. Sad.\", \"John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in an eerie hotel, naked and in the bathtub, with no memories and blood on his forehead. (I couldn't imagine a more strange and frightening experience.) The ring of the hotel phone breaks the silence-- a strange man on the other end tells him he must leave because there are people looking for him. Many events such as this one unfold in Dark City, where \\\"man has no past... and humanity has no future\\\".  Dark City has been passed over by so many critics it's depressing. I think that it should at least have been up for \\\"original screenplay\\\" or SOMETHING at the Oscars to reward Alex Proyas for his fantastic vision. I fail to see why so many people label this movie \\\"noir\\\" like it's BAD or something. Being dark and twisted is not a crime, and despite some other people's comments, this movie is NOT just for the trenchcoat-wearing masses (or if it is, maybe the rest of you can learn something from Goths). If you like sci-fi, dark plots and having reality be so well distorted that you don't realize it IS, so you will love Dark City. (People who have seen the Matrix BEFORE this movie MUST see it, it is very similar in these three respects).  I gave it a 9 out of 10 ONLY because I thought the ending fight scene was a bit weak. Great for a fight scene, but because the rest of the movie focuses on John Murdoch's quest to discover his past and the eerie, ominous happenings in the city, the climax seemed hastily thrown together, as if the crew all of a sudden remembered they had a deadline to meet and could no longer continue the plot in the previous fashion.  The visuals in this movie were absolutely stunning. The effects were NOT used to substitute for the plot, like other movies such as Starship Troopers, Lost in Space and Alien: Resurrection. They were used only as needed and were breathtaking. The editing is NOT as choppy as is rumored, it only lends to the power of the movie. There are some heart-stopping images in Dark City. Watch for the Strangers' clock, views of the city and John's memories.  Proyas takes ideas and ambience from many other movies but integrates them all neatly into Dark City. Gotham City is clearly seen as is Metropolis and other influences such as Ed Hopper's \\\"Nighthawks\\\" dominate in the diner scenes. The forty-ish era (yet strangely futuristic) city is known to be populated, and yet it is ominously empty (hence one of Hopper's main themes, isolation in large cities). (It's especially quiet at midnight, hehehehe... ;D ) This 40's era ambience together with the sci-fi fantasy undercurrent makes for a very interesting feeling while watching.  I'm happy that Kiefer Sutherland, Richard O'Brien (of Rocky Horror fame) and William Hurt agreed to do this movie, it gave Dark City just that much more validation in the USA (I wish things weren't like this, but they are). Kiefer Sutherland is absolutely wonderful and convincing as the doctor/scientist Dr.Schreber, and Rufus Sewell is a properly confused yet determined John Murdoch. Many critics say that William Hurt's character, the detective, and Jennifer Connelly's Emma Murdoch could have used a little more development, but I think part of the point of Dark City was that you don't really know who people are (not to mention yourself). Richard O'Brien and his character's whole race creep me out every time I see the movie, but he's especially frightening and a strange character. I had to resist the urge to talk like a Stranger after seeing the movie a few times.  Trevor Jones, one of my favorite movie composers, did the score for Dark City, and I must say it's very apropo. The deep, bass vocals and frantic themes are some of my favorite aspects, but \\\"Memories of Shell Beach\\\" is a haunting, beautiful song as well. Some of my other favorite scores by him are the Dark Crystal and Last of the Mohicans.  Altogether, I think Alex Proyas had a stroke of genius in the making of this movie. One of the most original dark sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time. It deserves its place with the Matrix, 12 Monkeys and others, pioneers in a field so changed (usually for the worse) since Star Wars and since earlier sci-fi classics. I hope these won't be the last of a (dare I say it?) dying race of movies that have true creativity and originality.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Dave\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0106673\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Day of the Dead\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0088993\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Dead Poets Society\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0097165\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"When I heard the title 1st I thought it must be a horror movie or something but when I saw it I enjoyed it very much. Because the movie reminds me myself. Not the way my parents wants me something different that I want, you know our school in here is just like their's. No girls and so boring and like them I'm passing the final year in my high school and after that I'm going to university. I saw the movie on December 2005. Now all of them are grown and are real men. When they recorded the movie I was just a baby because I'm born in 1988. In addition I wanna say that was a very cool movie and I liked it a lot and a big thanks to Robbin Williams with his excellent play.\", \"It's funny that Williams starred in this, b/c he was in another older movie called \\\"Sieze the Day\\\" with Jerry Stiller, about a loser trying to make a buck in NYC--A Saul Bellow story. I liked the beginning, when he told his students they would be \\\"worm food\\\" and told them to listen to the dead past students as he whispered \\\"Carpe Diem! Seize the Day!\\\" But I had to question some of the assumptions in the movie. For example, the poetry class was only one class out of several. It's not more important than any other, yet Professor Keating selfishly arrogates to himself the task of molding the character of these boys, as if the other teachers were all just dopes. He fills his impressionable students with the notion that it is better to be a hopeless romantic than a boring banker. But shouldn't the teacher focus on poetry, and having the students appreciate that, instead of trying to turn them all into romantics? After all, most of the students were sent there to become lawyers, bankers and doctors. A good teacher would have gotten the students to love poetry, not the teacher. Also, one IMDb critic wrote that \\\"this film only shows rebellion in the form of following a sectarian leader\\\". I missed that. True individualism and rebellion often are leader-less, and the film seemed to suggest that these impressionable boys either \\\"go with the official program\\\", or \\\"go with Professor Keating's\\\"--no third way, really. The biggest problem I had with the film was that the characters were not credible. Prof. Keating may have some charisma, but for all the students to love him so quickly, and spend their free time going into the same cave to read poems I found unbelievable. While they were there, they just acted silly, and no real attention was paid to poetry itself. Also, the boy Knox, who woos the girl, I found unbelievable. At first he's all shy, and toward the end, he becomes a real bohemian charmer with his poetry and professions of love. Yeah, right. Charlie Dalton, the one who takes most seriously the passionate teachings of his mentor, becomes quite the charmer and poet--but then all of a sudden becomes the one in the group who best predicts the political fallout of his actions (to try and get girls admitted to school). So which is he, a romantic poet, or a realist? Can't be both at that age. The saddest part of the movie was supposed to be the death of one student whose dad would't let him become an actor. I was a bit touched by his passionate \\\"Puck\\\" performance, but it was confusing because his dad walks in during the performance, and you're thinking \\\"his dad finally accepted him\\\", but no his insensitive dad drags him home, where his son eventually kills himself that same night. The boy just couldn't say what he felt to his dad, but the boy was a natural leader among other boys; it was frustrating and depressing. If the boy was too weak to even tell his father his passion, then he probably wouldn't have survived as an actor, either (that's my take). And like Emperor's Club, both teachers, although leaving their intangible, yet indelible mark on the young men they taught, are shown to be quite weak and naive in matters of the world and politics. In DPS, Prof Keating is made a scapegoat and kicked out from the school, even as he watches in humiliation another prof teaching the exact same \\\"excrement\\\" he told the students to rip out of their books. So he succeeded in stimulating some bohemian feelings into the bosoms of a few college prep kids, but then he can't teach there any more--good job. In Emperor's Club, Prof Hundert loses his spot as headmaster to a young, politically-connected upstart, even though he taught there for 30 years. What a sap. Why should any student respect a man who cannot even make his way in the world, and is surprised he's passed over for promotion for being so insular? He also seems puny to the grown-up bad boy Sedgewick Bell, the student he tried to unsuccessfully \\\"mold\\\" into a moral man--Bell invites him to his huge estate, where he also announces his candidacy for Senator--it makes prof Hundert's moralizing seem a bit silly. here he is invited, via helicopter, to this rich man's estate--Hundert looks like a fish out of water. Prof Hundert lives in his little-boy world of the Classical \\\"Greats\\\", and wrongly assumes that the great Greco-Roman leaders were men of high principles and honor, values he tries to instill onto his students. Yet any meager student of this era knows that the likes of Sedgewick Bell, the boy who cheats to gain favor, would have fit in just fine next to tyrants such as Augustus and Julius Caesar, who used Machiavellian cunning and force, not honor, to make their mark in history. So in that respect, Emperor's Club was even worse than DPS, because the basic premise that \\\"men of honor\\\" ruled the world of long ago is flawed, whereas in DPS, Prof Keating acknowledges the chaotic passion in poetry, and tries not to moralize as much as instill his students with the same romantic passion great poets felt. I want to see \\\"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\\\" to see how this stacks up against these 2. I give this film a 7. It is beautiful, touching, but too sentimental at times, which almost ruins it.\", \"As with many High School English classes, we had to watch this over the past few days. Unlike most \\\"school\\\" movies, however, I quite enjoyed it. Robin Williams was great as usual, a pleasant change from his typical over-the-top comedy roles. He is one of my favourite actors, as he can play so many types of roles so perfectly. The supporting cast was great as well, each having their own moments to shine. The film had a very good message, to always stand up for what you believe in, and to seize the day, Carpe Diem! Part of the ending bothered me, to avoid spoilers I wont go into why, though the final scene certainly made up for it. Overall, I was pretty surprised with this movie. Who knew they'd actually make us watch something good in school!  7/10\", \"I watched this for my English class and it portrayed some very interesting themes, still affecting todays world. The conformity, the outbreaks, the restrictions.... its all very real, and that's what I love about it! The only thing stopping me from giving it a full 10, was the fact that I didn't like the ending very much, even though the suicide was a shock, the whole thing about Mr Keating getting kicked out didn't entertain me at all. Another part of the movie I don't think is adequate is the scene in which Knox Overstreet is at the party with Chris. Although the part of him getting beaten up was funny,I don't think it was necessary to show him getting drunk.\", \"I am so much surprised when i see that this movie takes 7.7.It deserves much much over it.It is certainly in my top 10. Excellent characters, flawless scenario and a wonderful end. It is my first comment on this page and this movie is actually the reason why i am registered...You will for sure question your life after u watch it. This movie is not only to have a nice evening but also to question your life. The center of the movie is \\\"Carpe diem\\\" (sieze the life), which a few of us can achieve in these days. When i feel that my life is not going on as I wish, I am always re-watching this masterpiece. It always works on me. I suggest you, whatever your age is, to buy and watch this movie. You will not be regretful. Believe me. This movie is just PERFECT\", \"Everyone should definitely watch this movie. It changed my life. It's a constant reminder to \\\"make your life extraordinary,\\\" because often, we all get caught up in the daily routine of life and what \\\"we're supposed to be doing\\\" and we forget to live life to its fullest.  This movie will make your inner-child come out. I would especially recommend it if you are into romanticism and authors such as Thoreau. The poetry exposed in Dead Poets Society is some of the greatest in history, so if you're a literature geek, you should also watch this movie.   On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 20.\", \"First the flaws: 1) The Headmaster is too broad a character. When he mounts the podium at the beginning of the school year, the stern and set expression on his face sets him off as a hidebound traditionalist and curmudgeon. He is the obvious villain here. No free spirit - like Mr. Keating - will last long under him. 2) We viewers are not prepared for Neil's suicide. Through most of the movie he comes across as a well-adjusted seventeen year old. He gets along well with the other boys. He is a natural leader. His penchant for acting appears to stem from serendipity, young male exuberance, and fun. Despite his martinet of a father he does not lie in bed long hours brooding, nor does he ever come across as depressed or manic. So when his father threatens to withdraw him from Welton after his successful debut in a Midsummer Night's Dream, he might argue with his father or turn sullen, but it strains credulity that he would go to directly to suicide. Now the qualities: 3) The production values are excellent. The location is idyllic - New Castle, Delaware is as elegant in reality as it looks in the film. The cinematography is gorgeous, at times lyrical. And the period details are right - like the boys smoking whenever grownups are out of the room - without being forced. 4) I particularly appreciated the acting of Neil's father. He has probably grown up under humble circumstances, and through enormous self-discipline, long hours and weekends of hard work, and seizing the rare opportunities that have come his way, has achieved modest financial success and comfort. At least once he tells Neil how much he has sacrificed for Neil's education at Welton. Neil's a good kid; he's getting straight A's. Like so many fathers in real life this father can't understand his adolescent son. His threat to withdraw Neil from Welton and send him to military school is so extreme it borders on the implausible. I fault the script, not the acting.\", \"I watched this film the first time when I was 10 or something, but was falling in love with the film when I was 17. The same age of Knox Overstreet, Todd Anderson, and other guys in the movie.  \\\"Dead Poets Society\\\" talks about the lives of the students in the \\\"Welton Academy\\\", an elite prep-school preparing the students to ivy league school. These students were brought up in a strict and mainstream families.  All unexpectedly, the students are exposed to Mr. Keating, an English teacher whose will change their lives through \\\"free-will\\\" thinking.  One of the best film of all time!\", \"Dead Poets Society is an extraordinary movie that has a lot of meaning. When i watched this film, i found it unlike anything i had ever seen before, it shows you how one teacher can inspire and the change the life for A student, giving the confidence to find their path. I can say that when it comes to a great drama movie, Dead Poets Society should be on your 10 choices list. It may not have won the best picture Oscar, but most importantly, won the people's hearts.  Robin Williams plays an English teacher called John Keating, working in a very prestigious and strict school. He is new to the academy, and has different teaching methods that acquire the students fascination to the subject. No longer are they bored of English, but are dedicated to it, thanks to the teaching methods pf Williams. He teaches his students to stick with their individual beliefs and follow their individual passion. Seize the day.  I wish, i really wish that i had a teacher like John Keating!!\", \"This movie is incredible. Robin Williams shows that he has potential as a dramatic actor, not just FLUBBER and JUMANJI, material. He plays the wonderful role of Prof. Keating and inspires a class to think for themselves. There is some great humor in this, too. \\\"Mr. Pits... live above your name.\\\" \\\"Cccaaaarrrrrppppeee... Cccaaaarrrrrppppeee Diem...\\\" \\\"RIP! RIP IT OUT! Goodbye, Mr. J. Evans Pritchard, PhD. I want to hear the sound of more RIP!-\\\" and then the headmaster steps in. And the \\\"phone call from God... if it had been collect, it would have been daring.\\\" But all of this humor sets you up without knowing for Keating's fall from grace due to the suicide of one student (who I won't name). So, incredible.\", \"After having seen some of Peter Weirs other films(The Plumber,The Cars that ate Paris,The Green Card.)i decide to watch this.I have to say i feel this is one of his best films,thats a very strong character-driven film. The plot: In the 50s,new student Tood Anderson is sent to the same school where his brother did fantastically.While he is trying to play things down about his brother,he starts getting on with people at the school and gets a friend(Neil.)The thing that changes them is the new English teacher Mr Keating,who Tells them they should \\\"be themselves\\\" and not \\\"act like sheep\\\".Tood and Neil find out that Mr Keating used to be in a club called The Dead Poets society.After hearing about this,Tood and Neil decide to re-open the club to get themselves \\\"Free\\\",this will sadly end with one of them tacking there own life.... View on the film: The screenplay:written by Tom Schulman,while the film has a bit of a thin plot,Schulman makes the film feel like a really great European-type character driven film.The other things that is done very well is the change halfway into the film,where it takes on a very dark turn.While most movies would find it hard to change gears like that,this movie does it really well. The cast:The cast do a really good job at making the people feel very real.You can feel Williams moving away from his (very good)comedies,to giving really great performances for dramas.But,the main stand outs are Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leondas as Tood and Neil.They both give really great performances that make you feel they really are friends,and that when Neil dies,Hawke does a great job at showing the sadness he has,for losing a friend in such a sad way. Direction:Peter Weire does a fantastic job,at showing how the film (over the films time-line)changes.From something that looks really picture-perfect,that could be from an old faded photo album,to some very dark and disturbing images.(With very strong religious overtones-aseptically in the suicide scene.)But Weire always makes sure that the characters are the centre piece of the film.The other thing Weir did great and was very different (at the time) for getting a really good,serious performance out of Robin Williams. Final view on the film: A really great character-driven film,with a great cast,direction and a very moving story.\", \"SPOILER!!! I completely loved Dead Poets Society. It's definitely my favorite movie of all time. all of the actors are amazing, and i follow some of the actors work now... namely Robert Sean Leonard, Neil Perry, and Ethan Hawke, Todd Anderson. Great film, would recommend it to anyone, any time!! When Neil kills himself at the end of the film, I cried, cause i loved him. He was such a good guy, including Todd at the beginning when he had no friends. What i liked the most about Robert's character is how he was friends with everyone. Everyone was sad when he died, and though the other boys had their 'Tiffs' he wanted everyone to be friends. On a whole, great script, great cast, great sets and great MOVIE!!\", \"Well acted light drama with talented young and mature actors that show excellent chemistry between them.  Robin Williams delivers an over the top (but justified) performance as the \\\"cool\\\" teacher that is against the rigid manners of a conservative college for rich and spoiled young men. His students love him because he teaches them to squeeze and suck the day, \\\"carpe diem\\\". Most of the students have little or absent right to choose what they want from life as their parents are more or less than dictators. In their philosophy class, they can dream and act they way they want and that's why they think Williams' character is a hero or something like that.  Sadly, one of these students as any other young optimistic men follows his dream and becomes an actor against his father's will. He has the talents and the optimistic point of view but soon after he makes his debut in a play, his father punishes him the hardest way a father can do.  Watch \\\"Dead Poets Society\\\" to witness how men at a young age can be very optimistic with their ideals. The movie also shows that learning methods don't necessary have to be rigid or antiquate. But the movie is truly more than that; it's a moving movie with the usual family humor.  Great performances by Williams and Hawke who demonstrated to be a promising actor.\", \"I've seen this movie a lot of times,in fact,I bought it after I saw it the first time and I'm still always looking for time to watch it again. In this movie we can watch pretty good performances;emphasizing one or two of them would be unfair because they all are incredible,however I can say I consider Robin William's performance in this film the best of all his filmography. Technically,the whole crew made a unquestionably good work.The BSO worthy of an Oscar is mixed with wonderful landscapes caught with a brilliant photography. Peter Weir surpassed himself too with his work in this film. This film changes the audiences lives and make them feel into the film,because they talk about problems and subjects present in our society and make the audience think deeply about them as well as Mr Keating does in the film.After seen it everybody wants to \\\"be more\\\",and you feel you can \\\"be more\\\" if you simply \\\"SEIZE YOUR DAY\\\".\", \"\\\"Dead Poets Society\\\" is more than a lesson of life. It's a hymn to life. It has a good message: \\\"Carpe diem\\\", which means \\\"Seize the day\\\". I completely agree with that message because there's no coming back and time flies.  It's a reasonable movie with an inspiring story, good message, great performances from the actors, wonderful sceneries, awesome soundtrack (classical music, for example), drama and comedy.  John Keating is the kind of teacher that anyone would like to have as a teacher. A teacher with such a colorful imagination and sense of humor, a teacher who inspires his students to make their dreams come true and makes their lives extraordinary. I mean, wow! John Keating is brilliantly performed by the comedian Robin Williams. In general, Robin Williams is as humorous as usual in this movie, but we can also see some of his talent for drama.  Besides this incredible teacher, other great characters are: Neil Perry, Knox Overstreet, Charlie Dalton, Steven Meeks, Gerard Pitts, Todd Anderson and even Richard Cameron (although he has the power to anger us at the end because of his attitude). All of them are very well played by the actors.  About the boys, Charlie Dalton aka \\\"Nuwanda\\\" is the funniest of all. He's just hilarious! \\\"Nuwanda\\\" is such a funny nickname - lol.  Todd Anderson is a shy character portrayed by Ethan Hawke. This actor looked so different when he was younger and his role here is completely different from (for example) \\\"Before Sunrise\\\" and \\\"Before Sunset\\\".  Mr. Perry (Neil's father) is a complicated character. Like Kurtwood Smith himself says, \\u00abhe's understandable, not likable\\u00bb. He doesn't let Neil do what he wants and controls all of his life and future.  The ending is somehow... empty: Neil dies and \\\"Nuwanda\\\" is expelled. But the boys's homage to Mr. Keating at the end is admirable. What's even more amazing is that it is started by Todd Anderson.\", \"Best known for it's (in)famous 'oh Captain my Captain' sequence, Dead Poets Society's biggest problem is the clich\\u00e9s it invented for the high school movie drama. Today's jaded audiences might smirk at such examples as the shy boy finding the confidence to express himself through the help of a rebellious teacher, or the purity of youthful romance, but to the film's eternal credit, this was fresh ground after a decade of teen sex comedies. Dead Poets Society's teenagers aren't simply lust crazed hormone bags that wander into embarrassing social accidents every fifteen minutes, they're a tad more realistic...for most of the film at least. When the movie ventures into darker territory in the closing quarter it falters, becoming an awkward attempt at manipulating emotions that jars against the promising story told in the beginning.  Set in a prestigious school where the upper lips are stiff, the shirts stuffed and the emotions repressed, a class of teenage boys find their new English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams) taking a slight detour from the established curriculum. Encouraging them to think outside the box rather than be restricted by school-approved guidelines, he not only provides them with a full appreciation and love of poetry, but also a fresh mindset that focuses on seizing the day and acting on impulse. Soon, the boys are exploring various avenues of life (one becomes an actor, another pursues a local girl etc...) while their parents look on disapprovingly and the identikit old-fashioned teachers with grey hair and suits start trying to interfere.  What is most striking about this whole enterprise is that despite its reputation, there isn't a laugh to be had anywhere. This is not a Robin Williams comedy-drama, it's just a drama and the comedian suits the role perfectly. He is convincingly charismatic and just sentimental enough to stop you from choking on your own vomit, this is Robin Williams the actor, not Robin Williams the clown. However, he's also more of a supporting character, as the chief focus is on the boys (including Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke in their younger days) and they all play their characters well. Hawke is probably the best, his tearful breakdown in a snow covered field being surprisingly effective, but they all hold their own against the more experienced actors.  Shame then about the closing part of the story. With a sudden about turn, the film changes from an account of the individual versus the machine into a teenage suicide yarn all too quickly. This wouldn't be a problem if more time had been taken, but the character involved seems to decide to kill himself with as much ease as the rest of us pick what to have for lunch at work. And while I'm not an expert on teenage depression, I'd like to think it takes more for a young lad to blow his own head off than simply running into life's first obstacle.  Dead Poets Society therefore is ultimately a promise that wasn't completely fulfilled as the subtle, intelligent storytelling is blown out of the water by the mishandling of the closing scenes. Consequently, if you're anything like me, you'll spend most of the film trying to guess which kid pops his clogs. It's an enjoyable and involving drama, but as a tear-jerker it fails to move. Williams is excellent as always though and for seventy five percent of the time, Dead Poets Society is a great film.\", \"Standing on the Pinnacle of Giants  A secret domain of poets deceased, enlightens the men whose numbers increased. Assembled in class, they march with a stride, undaunted and strong with Keating aside. Passions intense, his lectures draw ears, like sheep of a flock, the Shepard of hearers. Expressions conveyed and rules provoked, the school of Welton becoming evoked. A boy with much flame who soared to the skies, accepted advice, unknowingly died. Unfortunate loss to teacher of choice, remember his words to raise your own voice. Now but a legend his message relays, be your own person and still \\\"Seize the day!\\\"\", \"Actually, the topic of this film could be quite interesting. Its narrative, as I view it, is characterised by the move from bad to worse. It offers considerable psychological insight into how easily students, in a very strictly ordered environment that gives them very little freedom, can fall pray to a kind of sectarian leader who demands that they worship him as their 'captain' and lose the sense of reality.  Two very different faces of totalitarianism are contrasted in a very interesting way. In principle, it should not matter that much that this is probably not what was intended.  Dostoyevski, for instance, was a staunch conservative who propounded a conservative nationalist and religious ideology, which did not prevent him from writing novels that show an astonishing variety of ideological and philosophical topoi. Therefore, it should not matter that much that, as it seems, the totalitarian action of the teacher was probably intended as a positive contrast to the strict order that is there at the college. But, in my view, in this case, the ideological purpose nevertheless affects the quality of this film. It is good for provoking thought about sectarian totalitarianism, but that's all. The pervasiveness of the ideological purpose dominates the whole story so much that most of the interesting qualities of the situation get lost.  I would say that this is a most typically American film, in the slightly derogatory sense this word often has to Europeans when used in cultural issues: It is dominated by ideas, such as freedom, but the words remain empty, devoid of liveliness, and there is not the slightest hint of the idea that flight from authoritarian order could mean something else than following a sectarian leader. I do not object to depicting such bleakness in movies, and it must probably be regarded as an achievement of this film that it can produce such repulsion in people who are not familiar with this kind of authoritarian society, but the bleakness is disguised in such a nice and kitschy American stereotypes, such as striving for freedom, that I find it just bad taste.\", \"A film that continually defies expectation, whether it is through the plot, characterizations, or performances of the actors. While you may not end up where you expected to, you are ultimately glad you went along for the ride.  It's 1959, and at Weldon Academy, tradition is everything. Weldon, however, is about to be shaken up by the arrival of John Keating (Robin Williams in an unusual dramatic turn), who encourages his students to look at things with new eyes. Among those who take his message most to heart are Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), son of an overbearing and unpleasant father (the truly evil Kurtwood Smith), and his roommate, Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), ignored younger brother of a previous Weldon valedictorian. While the students who form the \\\"Dead Poets Society\\\" have good intentions, participation in the group leads to Neil's defiance of his father, which in turn leads to tragedy. Todd has mostly been an observer throughout this, but the loss of one of the few people who cared about him, and the potential loss of another finally bring him out of his shell, and allow him to take his first stand.  This is an interesting script, in that it leads you to believe you're going to have a happy ending, and then snatches that ending away so quickly you hardly know what has happened. Before you can catch your breath, a suicide has occurred, the surviving parents are hounding the school, teachers and students are turning against each other, and the truth is buried under expediency, leaving the viewer wondering what was being taught in prep schools in the 1950's. In the end, Keating is used as a scapegoat to appease the anguished father, but the film leaves one more lesson to be taught before Keating leaves Weldon forever. Unfortunately, several plot points introduced prior to the suicide are simply dropped after it, leaving the viewer wondering what happened to the budding romance of one of the students and a town girl, as well as a few other things that just get left rather than addressed.  The setting of the prep school works rather well in this film, making it almost a world unto itself. The stone buildings represent the unchanging tradition valued so highly at Weldon. Nothing moves the stone; nothing changes the school. This further emphasizes the gulf between the students and the rest of the world on the occasions in which they enter it.  In spite of the flaws in the script, the performances are uniformly strong. Smith is the epitome of evil, oozing malice out of every pore in every scene he is in. Unfortunately, this works against him when he loses his son, in that we feel no sympathy for him at all. Williams gives a surprisingly restrained performance as Keating. What comedy there is in this film does not come from him. He plays Keating as a man of passion and integrity, who accepts his fate with grace and class. While Leonard can be a bit cloying, he does an excellent job of portraying Neil, especially the vulnerability which is behind the bravado. The most remarkable performance in the film Hawke's Todd. Not only do you see wonderful character development, but some of Hawke's most expressive acting occurs when he has no dialogue at all. It is through Todd's eyes that we see the end of the film - his upset that one of the Dead Poets Society has turned traitor and gotten another expelled, his disbelief that the others have joined in the persecution of Keating, and his inability to take a stand against that injustice. Most impressive is the scene where Todd watches Keating pack to leave the school, rather than pay attention to class. Todd has no dialogue throughout, yet Hawke's portrayal is so skillful that you see everything he is feeling, and the buildup to his outburst. A truly unforgettable scene.  This is a movie with an unhappy, yet satisfying ending. An injustice has been committed, but it has also been recognized, and perhaps a lesson learned. A thoughtful film, well worth watching repeatedly.\", \"In a sense, this movie was indeed the celebration of Dead Poets the world over !   Dead Poets Society ! I am guessing a large number of you, like me, were expecting a bunch of spooky irregular events at the mutter of that name. Certainly wasn't to be, it is an inspirational odyssey which will make you pounce upon time and reclaim your life. Carpe Diem and the spirit that John Keating (played by Robin Williams) stands for could easily be misinterpreted by the turn of events in the movie, especially Neils poignant death. To do so is to completely miss the point. The spirit of Carpe Diem lies in the painstaking eventualities which one will have to brave to follow the lead of passion and fervor.   Robin Williams plays a professor of poetry, John Keating at the prestigious Welton School, with a management making sufficient hay with the schools continual academic shine. His particularly unorthodox methods of teaching soon make one realize that poetry is not something to do with rhyming words or fantasy lands, but that poetry is in effect a direct means to ones disposition in life, a disposition which would ring success in all avenues. His students soon change their very outlook towards life indulging in activities much to the displeasure of the academically unbending deans of the school. Harvesting discontent against Keating, the deans soon latch on to the one opportunity(or misopportunity I must say) that comes their way in the form of Neils death to see the removal of Keating from the school and the teaching profession.   The last few minutes celebrate every individualistic spirit to let you segue into a illusive reality. A young Ethan Hawke playing an even younger student redeems his professors every drop of sweat with \\\"Oh Captain ! My Captain !\\\" . Watch the movie and you will see why ! At least for half an hour after I watched this movie, I managed to drive mans favorite clich\\u00e9 \\\"Life Sucks!\\\" into oblivion. I suppose the students at Welton were not the only ones Professor John Keating inspired.\", \"There is a scene early in DEAD POETS SOCIETY wherein Robin Williams, as a new literature teacher at an upscale boys prep school, tells his class that he wants them to learn to think for themselves. To this end, he orders them to tear out of their text books pages which feature commentary by the book's editor. \\\"Think\\\" he seems to be saying, \\\"but first, let me censor this book.\\\"   Free thought through censorship? I can only assume the said literature book includes Orwell's \\\"1984.\\\"  In Orwellian fashion, hypocrisy is the order of the day in DEAD POETS SOCIETY. It gives a rousing, inspirational sermon (\\\"Seize the day!\\\" is the teacher's motto.), yet the story itself mocks the film's supposed intentions. DEAD POETS SOCIETY is about failure, but it won't admit it; worse, it seems to believe it's own inspirational PR. The film serves up a tacked on and utterly false moment of triumph at the end, but everything that proceeds that is a lesson in failure. Williams fails to teach the students to show moral courage. One student commits suicide rather than fight for his beliefs. When Williams is wrongly accused of something, his supposedly adoring students turn on him like a pack of weasels. The one student who stands up for his ideals is expelled from the school and forgotten by the film. A father fails his son. The school fails its students. And the film fails its audience.  Yet, for some inexplicable reason, people remember the film for its inspirational message: Seize the day! Carpe Diem! Fine words, but at no time are they supported by the empty pessimism that the film displays. The characters who do take chances are immediately and soundly punished. Those who knuckle under -- showy, petty acts of deviance aside -- plod along.  Williams is okay as the teacher, but all credibility is lost when he stops to toss in imitations of Marlon Brando and John Wayne. Robert Sean Leonard comes off best as the doomed student, though his suicide seems remarkably undermotivated. Kurtwood Smith offers up a wholly unconvincing stereotype as the doomed student's martinet father.   Thanks to Peter Weir's efficient direction and some nice cinematography, DEAD POETS SOCIETY has a facade of class; but only if you don't pay too close attention to Tom Schulman's dreadful (though Oscar-winning) script. The irony is that a film that begs you to think is best enjoyed if you don't.\", \"I'm impressed. It was an all around good film. Perhaps I'm biased - Robert Frost's poem, A Road Not Taken, was quoted - yet so many other things were as well.  It's not about poetry. It's about how you look at the world. How you look, how others look... how you think, how you feel... and a warning to never, ever become conformist (though being conformist about walking is perhaps slightly exaggerated). Never become conformist - always make up your own mind.  I liked the music, as well. The bag pipes give a certain special touch.  I gave it an 8/10 - a high score for me.\", \"Dead Poets Society is a thoroughly moving, and inspiring film from Peter Weir, who is definitely one of the most under rated directors around. This movie is in the same vein as \\\"A Separate Peace\\\", in the sense of setting, and in the general coming of age story line. The basic message is to \\\"suck the marrow out of life\\\", as the passage for the society reads, or to live every moment to the fullest. It is inspiring and uplifting for the first hour and 15 minutes or so, before changing stride altogether to a somewhat depressing but remarkable conclusion. This is a must see.\", \"Dead Poets Society is, to use a clich\\u00e9, a cinematic masterpiece. I can watch it over and over, absorbing more nuances of meaning every time. As a former teacher myself (albeit of science), I view it as a tribute to the profession at its best...teaching not merely the subject but also the person, and having a lifelong impact on students' lives.  The setting is Weldon Academy, a very traditional New England boys' prep school in 1959. If I can find one flaw with the movie...and there certainly aren't many...it's the underlying premise that seems to worship free thought and implies that ALL tradition is of necessity undesirable and thus to be avoided. Frankly, compared to modern classrooms which are bastions of free expression, I found the Weldon students' respectful treatment of their teachers rather refreshing. (But perhaps that's just the ex-teacher in me coming out!) Some of Weldon's ideals, generally referred to in mocking tones, are actually qualities to which parents rightfully DO hope their offspring will aspire.  Robin Williams plays Mr. Keating, the English teacher we all wish we'd had. He brings warmth, passion, and an endearing quiet humor to the role as he fosters individualism in a school environment of total conformity, endeavoring to teach these young men both the beauty of the English language and the importance of living life to the full, of \\\"seizing the day\\\". How many of us mentally revolted at the dissection of poetry when we were in school? Many a viewer will both chortle and rejoice when Mr. Keating has his class rip out the methodical, emotionless \\\"Introduction to Poetry\\\" from the time honored Pritchard textbook!   The \\\"Dead Poets Society\\\", and the boys on which Mr. Keating has such a profound impact, include an interesting mix of characters...Neil Perry (the passionate young man at odds with his father's clearly defined expectations for his son's life), Todd Anderson (the classic shy adolescent, through whose eyes we view the unfolding drama), Charlie Dalton (the quintessential rebel), Knox Overstreet (the teen with whom most viewers can identify, deep in the throes of first love), and Richard Cameron (the mindless conformist).  Ethan Hawke gives a moving performance as Todd, the younger brother of a former Weldon valedictorian and my personal favorite, who undergoes a character transformation as the plot unfolds. In a sense, this movie is really Todd's story. As another reviewer has wisely pointed out, his best scenes are sometimes when he has no dialogue at all. Your heart will ache for him. The sub-plot of young Overstreet's romance with a girl from a nearby school may not be brilliant, but it provides some light, entertaining relief from the main drama.   Needless to say, Mr. Keating's unorthodox approach meets with obstacles...from his fellow teachers, from the school's ultra traditional Headmaster, from Neil's overbearing father and the other parents, who are depicted as a conservative, status conscious lot. His encouragement of adolescent individualism leads to dramatic consequences for one student in particular, triggering a dramatic scenario that engulfs most of his classmates. I don't want to give the plot away, but Dead Poets Society has the most powerful ending I've experienced in the cinematic world. I could watch it over and over, and tears would either come to my eyes or virtually stream down my cheeks every time.  It's an intelligent film, both gripping to watch and thought provoking afterward. Engaging plot, memorable characters, meaningful theme, wonderfully done scenes and atmosphere...Dead Poets Society has it all. A special tip of my hat to the cinematography; clearly, it should have won an Oscar for the final scene alone.  This is a must-see movie, especially if you're a high school student who hates English. It might just change your view of the subject, even if your actual teacher doesn't quite measure up to Mr. Keating. And for everyone...not only \\\"Carpe Diem\\\", but a certain phrase from a Walt Whitman poem will take on incredible meaning and be remembered forever.\", \"I watched this movie today for about 15-th time. I'm never bored with it. A few hours ago I felt lonely and depressed.I decided to watch it without the scenes that evoke sadness.And even though I watched it so many times before I found it restorative and heart lifting. There are many good films.Also there are probably many better than this one;cause it's not flawless. But if you believe that a movie can change your life, I have no doubts that this one can influence you as no other. If you have not watched it yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Go to the video rentals and buy it.Yes, don't rent it but buy it.It's a movie that you will watch many times.Perhaps it will even save you..As it had saved me..\", \"The film Dead Poets Society is a film that explores the idea of \\\"Carpe Diem\\\" (seize the day) from the viewpoint of a classroom of young men at an all boys boarding school. Their teacher Mr. Keating (played by Robin Williams)helps them stretch their minds, and exercise their right to defiant acts of love for life and poetry, rebuttlng society. The director Peter Weir treats you with eye candy by using various camera shots of beautiful scenary, and neat techniques. Weir takes you on a roller coaster that leaves you gripping your seat, enjoying life, and thinking \\\"Carpe Diem\\\" in your own life. There are some very depressing scenes, but they are very artful, and teach you of appreciation for those brave members of society that dare stand up for their beliefs, and rights to wrestling around with life. I thought Ethan Hawke (Todd Anderson) gave a true life twist to the film, Robin Williams (Mr. Keating or also known as Captain my captain) added an element of excitement, and Robert Sean Leonard (Neil Perry)added passion that leaves you mesmerized. I just saw this film in English class, but I immediatly fell in love with it, as I know you will.\", \"Not only will this movie touch your heart and bring tears, it will inspire you to be a better teacher to others and to follow your dreams no matter what the boundaries may be. It is truly poetry on the screen... a great story and a touching social commentary on humanity and life's greatest challenges. If you haven't seen it yet, rent it now. It has taken my love of poetry to an entirely new level!\", \"I have no need to summarize this movie seeing as how most people tend to do that anyway so, therefore, any addition of such would simply be frivilous. However, I am somewhat disappointed to see how people tend to misinterprate this film by proclaiming that the movie's message of carpe deium is derailed by the fact that those who apply it end up losing. This could not be further from the truth. In the beginning, when the young men are first introduced to this idea of sucking the marrow out of life it is applied by the students when its results prove to be fun and joyous. The point really driven home by the movie though is to stand up for one's beliefs throughout all of life no matter how hard it may prove. Now, while the character of Neil, does try to do what he feels he must without regard to his father, in the end, he doesn't stand up at all, but simply accepts his father's authority. Some may not like it but his story serves to prove just how important it is to stand one's ground no matter how hard it may be. It's not only his character, but in fact every character in the film that does not fully understand Mr. Keating's message until the very end by finally doing what they feel is right now matter how much the opposing forces deny this basic truth.   I urge everyone to give this movie a chance and to see it for what it really is. It may just change your life.\", \"First of all, this is movie is my all-time favorite, out of all the hundreds of films I have seen. However, every time I mention this film, I have to answer most people's quizzical looks with \\\"It's a beautiful little 80s film that stayed in the 80s.\\\" After seeing it for the 24th time since I first saw it 5 years ago, on my 13th birthday, I can gladly say that this movie went far and beyond the 80s, and the power and inspiration of the message can be felt every day.  Dead Poets Society is a most underrated film by a most underrated director whose inspiring, uplifting and moral tales firmly grounded in reality are not nearly as appreciated as they should be. Here, we see one of his very personal and cradled projects, and he shows the visual style and concentration on characters in which he is so affluent. His control of the camera and the characters are very strong and very smooth. The cinematography is near perfect, with every shot, along with the editing, seamless. Also very compelling are the color-tones in every scene, perfectly matching the mood and events of the scene. Could you say this is art? Absolutely.  Then we have the performances. Robin Williams continues in stride as one who has to-date remained the most touching, heart-wrenching, awe-inspiring comedians with inarguable acting talent (he still remains my most favorite performer on the film screen). His Professor John Keating is a man who embodies every professor who you thought was cool and respectable, every person who taught or enlightened you in something out of the ordinary. In fact - dare I say it? - he teaches something EXTRAORDINARY! We have the tragically underrated Robert Sean Leonard in his role as the free-thinking catalyst student Neil. Why is this man not a household name/Hollywood heavyweight? His roles are always full of inspiration, energy, and tragic emotion that never fail to move an audience. His role in this movie is fresh, unhindered, and never pretentious as the cautionary tale of the movie. And then we have Ethan Hawke in one of his earliest roles as the point-of-view character. The entire supporting cast is very strong, also, providing the foundation and serve as the various emotional ties that further involve us in the story. Josh Charles's role as Knox Overstreet is a role that almost all guys can relate to wholeheartedly. And of course, all the actors who are in that Dead Poets Society do a fine job.  And lastly, the story. I won't summarize it since it's been summarized many times here, but I will say that it is one of the best coming of age stories for not only adolescents, but anyone. I have personally heard from nine-to-fivers who were inspired by this movie to change the situations of their jobs, careers, relationships for the better. I first saw this movie when I was 13, and immediately stamped, crowned and elevated this movie as my all-time favorite. Now that I am 18 and living on my own, with very different concerns than back then, I turn back to this movie over and over again, to find inspiration, solace and of course, entertainment. It is still my all-time favorite, and it still inspires me to seize the day and make my life extraordinary.\", \"There are certain films that get under your skin, never to come out. They change your life, subtly altering your perceptions of reality, almost always for the better.  Dead Poets Society is one of those few films.  I saw the movie back when I was in High School. I had a teacher who told us that we really needed to watch it; in fact, it was our \\\"homework\\\" for the day. We didn't need to bring back a report, or talk about it in class. All he asked from us was to watch it, make up our own mind about it, and that was it. As you can imagine, many friends of mine didn't watch it at all; I did. And yes, I feel I changed a bit from there on.  Back when you are young, you never really stop to think what in the world you are doing with your life. You simply live for the day, hope your grades will be enough to pass, and that's it. Long term thinking involves maybe flirting with a girl. Nothing more. What this film showed me was that we have the responsability and the joy of being alive in this planet. That we are dust, and we will go back to it, so we have precious little time to make a difference. That we have a moral obligation to \\\"seize the day, and make our lives extraordinary\\\" (my favorite quote in all movie history). That the world, basically is ours. That the only limitations are within ourselves, and that we owe it to us to fight, to rebel against conformity, to change what we hate and keep what we love. That living in this world is a beautiful responsability, and that only cowards dare not to change it for the better.  The fact that the cast was basically my age, and was passing through the same dilemmas and situations I was facing made it all so much more powerful.  So here I sit, 12 years from that day. I still don't think I have seized the day completely. But I keep on trying; I always will. I wonder how many people were transformed by this gem of a movie; I hope many.  10 out of 10. A definitive masterpiece.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Deep Rising\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0118956\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Deer Hunter\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0077416\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Demolition Man\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0106697\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Devil and Daniel Webster\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0033532\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Die Hard\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0095016\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"This film cannot be beaten in terms of action. Bruce Willis will always be remembered for starring in this. And rightly so, it is a non-stop thrill ride from about 20 min. in until the finish. Having said that, the first 20 min. are not boring, as time is needed to build up the characters. Which is where the other half of this film comes in. The brains.  Sure you can have guys leaping from skyscrapers or blowing up buildings, but there has to be a reason for it to happen. Also, unlike most action films, the 'bad guy' is the protaginist, and McClane, the 'good guy' is the antaginist.  Anyway, I could've written more, but that's the point I wanted to make, action films need more than just action.\", \"I can't believe this isn't in the top 50 thrillers of all time. Die Hard is a big budget action movie, with sophistication. Alan Rickman, who plays the film's German uber-baddie, really controls the part and brings in some blunt wit. Die Hard is the best and probably most violent of the trilogy. Endlessly entertaining and effortlessly rewatchable, Die Hard is a classic. 8.2 out of 10.\", \"What can you say about Die Hard that hasn't been said a million times before? How about 'its crap'? Well, the reason why that hasn't been repeated ad nauseum is because it blatantly isn't true.  Die Hard is one of those rare genre defining films. The first time I saw it I was 9 and was totally blown away. I have probably watched it once a year since then and I don't think its lost any impact.  You know the drill by now. John McLane is out numbered (but never outgunned) by a group of terrorists in a high tech building. Cue much death and destruction before happy ending. It sounds so simple. Well, actually, it is. Die Hard perfected the formula of the action film, attempted by so many 80's films. Its actually a testament to Die Hard that they 'don't make em like they used to'.  \", \"The start of probably the greatest action triolgy alongside Indiana Jones has to rate highly. A movie that is action packed, laced with great one liners and see's the good guys kicking ass over terrorist before it was popular. Its not for everyone, not one movie is, but if you love action movies, make sure you've seen this one.\", \"(CONTAINS SPOILERS) The action classic DIE HARD gives us what we expect.  Bruce Willis plays the character as John McClane, a tired, confused, irritated but very deadly cop who gladly kills some men to save his wife whose being helt hostage.  STORY: Christmas in town! NYPD cop John McClane has come all the way to Los Angeles just to make things up with his wife this Christmas. Holly (wife) is working in Nakatomi Plaza and there is being held a Christmas party and under that, 12 uninvited guests appears. Twelve German terrorists high-jacks the skyscraper and declares war against everything and everyone. They've expected anything...except John McClane there you see, that is running in the fire stairs with his serving gun and he's p***ed off!  \\\"Come to the coast, get together have a few laughs!\\\" Bruce Willis' performance as the cop couldn't have been done better so I'm not complaining about him, no - but the show gets stealed by the villain, as too often - Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber. The movie ir brilliant in the most ways and entertains you perfect! In the same time being a funny movie it's violent, exciting and tough as nothing else! We're waiting for the fourth Die Hard movie to come, but that I think is going to be a big mistake! Without doubt the best movie in the trilogy...great and simply tough and funny!\", \"This is the movie that has been cloned more times than sheep and hamsters combined. Bruce Willis shines and stars in this high tech action thriller. Everyone knows what the movie is about. Everyone knows how the movie will end. That doesn't mean that it isn't GREAT. It is the best Bruce Willis movie to date, in my opinion. Die Hard with a Vengeance was almost as good as this was. Go see the trilogy today. 3 3/4th *'s out of 4 *'s.\", \"Bruce Willis stars as John McClane a NYC cop who finds himself the only one who can stop a terrorist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) who has taken over an office building and is holding thousands of people hostage in this exciting and jaw dropping actionflick which isn't only a movie but a pulse pounding experience. Die Hard is a genre classic best watched on DVD with excellent sound effects to test your speakers.\", \"This is the ultimate action flick. Bruce Willis shines as the hero John McClane, and Alan Rickman is excellent as the terrorist leader Hans Gruber. Reginald VelJohnson (TV's Carl Winslow) is great as McClane's police contact on the ground. The story is compelling, and the action is incredible. There are plenty of gunshots, explosions, and an amazing hand-to-hand fight between Bruce and Alexander Godunov. John McTiernan outdid himself as an action director with this movie.  Special mention goes to Jan de Bont for his wonderful cinematography. You can say what you want about his directorial efforts, but the man is a top-notch photographer.\", \"  My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****  One word I would use to describe Die Hard is energetic. Once this movie gets started it doesnt slow down. The action scenes arent overblown like some in the movies today. The movie is set at a perfect pace.   Although the movie is expertly paced, it is well made in other areas. The movie is well written, both storywise and dialogue. It has some very good one-liners.   Another area that is worth mentioning in Die Hard is the acting. Bruce Willis may not be the Best Actor, but he is very good as John McClane. Alan Rickman is fantastic as the villain, possibly the best or at least one of the best villains in an action movie. The rest of the cast gives solid performances.   Die Hard may just be some action movie, but it is one of the best.  My Rating: ***1/2 out of\", \"  this is an action movie that works. i am not a fan of most action movies. you have to believe that the hero is a real person and that he is in real danger... the minute you know a character is getting out okay, the minute the franchise dulls. bruce willis was so perfectly ordinary and so perfectly tough, that this role really worked. only mel gibson really had that quality in the first Lethal Weapon. and not everyone could pull it off (certainly not Sylvester or Arnold). i genuinely believed that john mclane was thinking of these things as he went along. even the ridiculous cliches were pulled off nicely. the wife wasn't a victim, but a clear head. i think the second Die Hard was strong also, but when the wife's character disappeared, a lot of the heart was lost. he was no longer a father and husband like in the first one. he no longer seemed like someone who really wanted to live. but in this one, there's a real sense of pain (as in the bloody feet) and urgency (his wife and kids). 7/10. probably not deserving of the top 250 movies of all time, but great nonetheless.\", \"Die Hard - what a movie. What a legend. The ultimate pointless, shallow, and unnaturally contrived movie makes for one hell of a viewing experience.  It's non-stop action, non-stop cliches, non-stop formulaic plots and villainous men with German accents, you've got to love it. Bruce Willis is at highest form in a role which needs nothing but highly toned abs and occasional smart alec NYC one-liners. Alan Rickman is the really loveable part of this film. A real-life German terrorist couldn't do better playing this role.  You can probably tell I've just finished watching it, the adrenaline is still pumping through my veins, my wry smile still plastered across my face. John McTiernan sure packs a punch, I can tell you that. The best thing about this film is that it's just a movie. It doesn't try to be anything but a formulaic, by-the-numbers, big budget action hit and so it works spectacularly for what it's trying to achieve. Provided you don't expect a masterpiece of filmmaking, what you'll receive is a masterpiece nonetheless.  There's no need to analyse this film much further, it's a thrill ride, utterly shallow and hopelessly artificial. You've gotta love it. **** / *****\", \"No doubt about it, to a lot of people, Bruce Willis will ALWAYS be John McClane, for better or worse.  In the film that made him a star, or at least got him out of TV work, Bruce Willis is New York native cop John McClane, come down to LA to see his estranged wife and family for the Christmas holiday. Then Hans (Alan Rickman, in one of his best evil performances) and a group of thieves posing as terrorists who look European male models and an obnoxious black computer hacker show up, take over the building and try to rob the place. Only McClane can stop them, and his only real support comes from Sgt. Al Powell (played by the dad from TV's \\\"Family Matters\\\"). Calamity, chaos and mayhem ensue as McClane and the foreign thugs tear the building apart trying to kill each other in the ultimate battle of all American cowboy hero and sophisticated Eurotrash and the idiot cops and FBI gets trip over themselves to help out.  Based on the novel by Roderick Thorpe. Bonnie Bedelia is Bruce's wife, and the late Alexander Godunov is Karl, who's vendetta with Bruce turns personal. Bonnie does well as the sympathetic wife with a bad haircut and Godunov, in a role very different from his debut part as an Amish farmer in \\\"Witness\\\", is surprisingly menacing in spite of his pretty boy looks. Of course, it helps that his career as a ballet dancer gave him more dexterity than the usual hulking henchman. His knock-down-drag-out brawl with Willis is one of the best.  Alan Rickman commented that he didn't view Hans as \\\"the villain\\\", but more as a guy who \\\"has made certain choices in life, wants certain things in life and goes after them.\\\" All the same, Alan is the perfect villain for Bruce's wise cracking McClane, who is neither weak nor super human. Bruce worked very hard on this film and allegedly did a lot of his own stunts and really brought a lot of life and warmth to a character who could very easily have been just another grim loner. It's a shame that he's had to spend the majority of his career trying to get away from this character (kind of like Sean Connery trying to live down his glory days as James Bond). And to think that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Burt Reynolds and Richard Gere all turned this part down (probably better that they did).  Sadly, the appeal of the McClane character was lost in #3 \\\"Die Hard: With A Vengeance\\\", where McClane HAD become a grim, burned out, wasted loner.  A big part of the power of \\\"Die Hard\\\" is that there are no easy escapes, very few places to run and very little \\\"cheating\\\" as director John McTiernan put it. And it's true that very few moments require you to suspend logical disbelief, although we do have to question if it's possible to successfully pull of the stunt where Bruce jumps off the building with a hose wrapped around him.  So grab the popcorn and get ready for the madness of \\\"Die Hard\\\"! This is actually one of the few action films my family and I enjoy watching together. This was actually filmed at the 20th Century Fox Plaza.\", \"It's not the best gun movie. It's definitely not the best fighting movie. It doesn't have the best dialogue. It doesn't have the best cast. It doesn't have the best plot. What it has is possibly the best combination of the above in any action movie every made. It takes the pieces that it has to work with and forms a better whole. The dialogue is good. The cast is good (Rickman is the best of the bunch). The plot is good. Together, they are great. This film is the benchmark by which all American action movies should be judged. If an action film is better than Die Hard, then it deserves to be praised for that achievement alone.  I rate it a 8.5/10 in it's genre. I gave it a 9 here.\", \"Die Hard  John McClane is in California to visit his wife, whom he is seperated from due to different dreams of careers and he hasn't been able to handle he succes in her new job. But it's christmas so he comes to see his family, while picking up his wife at her firm, a group of terrorist shows up and holds all guests as hostages, John McClane manages to escape and is now the only hope to save the hostages and alert the police.  Overall action movies are always very similar and predictable, and this movie is too predictable, perhaps that is the only big weakness of this movie, because who can deny there is something special with Die Hard. Die Hard is simply a very progressive, accelerated and perfectly paced action movie, not only does it tell a good story, and even comes with a few complexes, it also brings some of the best and most solid action ever to be seen.  John McTiernan has proven to be a solid action director over the years, after the breakthrough with Predator he made this classic action flick, that never seems to be getting old, even now. 17 years later, it still works as well as it did 17 years ago, brilliant.  This is just what I suppose we can call a perfect popcorn movie, the kind of movie where you lean back and just let the thrill ride begin, you know things will end happily, but still it entertains for the 2 hours it lasts, and it entertains at a very high level. Perhaps one of the weaknesses of the movie is the happy ending, I would have loved a darker ending, leaving something to think about, especially since there obviously is the problematic climax involved in the movie, there are some good side stories, especially the dramatic with John and Holly's marriage. Strangely that works out perfectly and we get to know everything about it, even though the movie actually doesn't spend much time explaining, it's just done so well and perfectly direct that we basically know everything about these two when the movie ends.  I am not sure if this was a final breakthrough for Bruce Willis, but he definetely shows in this movie what great actor he is, we see a lot of different sides of him, the tough guy, the soft guy, and even better, the funny guy. I hardly ever l\\u00e1ugh in movies, and I hate unserious movies that are trying to hard to make you laugh, but the jokes in this movie are perfect, especially the one signed by Bruce Willis, I loved his attitude, perfect performance!  To sum it all up a bit, as we always do. This is a really great action classic, an unforgettable movie that never gets old, no matter how many times you watch it, this must be like the 5th time for me, and it's still highly entertaining, it has no slow moments and just moves out there at a perfect pace for 2 hours. The weak sides is perhaps that it's such a classic and traditional action movie that we know the end before the movie starts, sadly, an ending that would have left me breathless would have been better for me, but maybe other people think differently. I just like dark endings.  8/10\", \"After many years have passed I have to say that this movie kept me hanging as it did when I watched it was seems now like ages ago. The Sheriff of Nottingham was the main villain (I don't think he could ever play a good guy with his expressions but just as well because he's always perfect as a downright evil mastermind). This is basically what made Bruce Willis and rightly so, he did do some of his best acting in it. All the bad guys were pretty good, the only character that really got on my nerves was Ellis because he was just such a sleaze. I thought it was cool that the father from \\\"Family Matters\\\" (Reginald VelJohnson I think) made an appearance as a cop because he really is such a great actor yet you don't get to see him in too many pictures. This film is still exciting to watch and I definitely recommend it for this upcoming holiday season (as they play many Christmas songs throughout)! Yippy-kay-yay.  Final Innuendo:  Movies : I was an 80's child and even so I unfortunately missed this opportunity.  DVD Purchase : I could definitely see myself watching this once yearly.  Rental : A fantastic idea!\", \"There has been a barrage of action films over the last two decades. Stallone's and Segal's stuff come to mind. All of these movies had plenty of action, violence and profanity. But the two things these movies were lacking were sustainable plot and character development.  In 1988, Die Hard came out. Bruce Willis, who before hand had only Blind Date and Moonlighting to his credit, was cast as the main character, John McClane. Richard Gere, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Burt Reynolds were all up for the role. The thing that separates McClane from all other action heroes before this movie is that McClane is an average character. He isn't a robot; he isn't some big muscley guy, or an expert and karate. He's vulnerable, bitter about his failing marriage, he's a funny guy. Schwarzenegger or Stallone would have never been able to achieve this. Gere and Reynolds have had too much confidence. Neither is particularly good at being sarcastic either. And the main thing that separates Bruce Willis from all the others is that Willis ad-libbed most of his funny one-liners. No one else could have brought the same charisma to John.  The opening scene has John McClane gripping his seat as his plane is landing. This opening scene shows you how McClane can be vulnerable and that he does have fears. The passenger next to him notices John's fear of flying and gives him this advice: \\\"After you get where you're going, take off your shoes and socks and make fists with your toes.\\\" Once at the Christmas party, he learns that his wife, Holly, still uses her maiden name, and meets Ellis, the womanizing, cocaine snorting, co-worker of Holly. Ellis evidently has his eye on Holly. He's also pretty arrogant as he points out the Rolex that he and the company gave to Holly for all her hard work. John and Holly get away to a private washroom to talk by themselves, a talk that escalates into an argument over their marriage. In the middle of their argument, Holly is brought out to give a speech to the rest of the workers. John is left there to think about his stupidity of picking an argument with his wife the minute he arrives. Still tense from the flight, he takes off his shoes and socks and makes fists with his toes.  Meanwhile, a man named Hans Gruber and his group of \\\"terrorists\\\" pulls into the in-door parking lot of Nakatomi Plaza. After cutting off the phone lines and exits, they seize control of the Christmas party by gathering them all into one room. John McClane, armed with only his police issue Berretta, manages to escape out the emergency exit while the terrorists are gathering up the others. Shoeless and sickle's, he manages to make it to an empty floor where he's panicked, alone, and scared.  Hans Gruber is methodical, precise, and is patient. He's charming and intelligent and he doesn't seem like the type of person to kill another human in cold blood. He takes the head of the company, Takagi, up to the next floor where they work him for the access code to the main computer. When Takagi makes it apparent that he doesn't know the code, Hans doesn't hesitate. He shoots him through the head, point blank. Meanwhile, a shocked John is hiding behind a table, where he witnesses the killing of Takagi.  This is a summary of the first 30 minutes of the film, and I'm not going to give anything else away. Already, we've got a sense of what our two main characters are like. Unlike most action movies, the bad guy isn't a maniacal psycho who enjoys violence and kills people without an ounce of mercy. He's still an evil man who will kill anyone if it serves his purpose. But we understand Han's motivations. John McClane is a much chattier protagonist than most action heroes, and even talks to himself on numerous occasions before he starts talking Hans or the cops. It's easier to identify with him.  Even if you are not a fan of action movies, Die Hard is a movie that everyone should see at least once. It will definitely help you appreciate action movies much more, even if it doesn't convert you into a total fan of the genre.\", \"Die Hard, one of the greatest action movies of all time, still to this day, it's more impressive than ever. If you were to look in the dictionary and look up the word action, this movie would probably be shown, lol. My mom was just absolutely in love with this film and told me how much I should see it if I love action movies, also I had become a Bruce Willis fan, so when she mentioned that, I decided to sit down and watch it. It's not just Bruce Willis that makes this movie, although he does a fantastic job as the ultimate hero, his line delivery is always perfectly on cue and he's just such a cool guy that anyone could love. But for me it was Alan Rickman who truly steals the film, he is the ultimate bad guy and his voice was just so creepy, I love him. But all together the cast and special effects truly make this a memorable film for generations to come.  John McClane is a police officer who has taken his career very seriously, a little too seriously since his wife is about to divorce him and he's about to loose his children. When John comes to see his wife, Holly, at her office building during the company Christmas party, he asks if he can be given a second chance, but that gets slightly interrupted when terrorists enter the building. Hans Gruber, the leader of the terrorists, wants 600 million dollars of bonds from the company's owner. But with John in the building, he's gonna have a hard time because John is on his case will make sure to give him a roller coaster of a crime bust.  This is without a doubt the most exciting action movie since The Terminator. I love the whole idea of this taking place around Christmas, it just adds a little more dark humor. Especially the way that Alan Rickman says \\\"Now I have a machine gun. Ho...Ho...Ho\\\", it was just so perfect! I really love Die Hard, I am officially a fan, this is just the most awesome movie to watch. Believe me, it's that good, I highly recommend this movie for anyone, it's a lot of fun, I guarantee you that you will not be disappointed.  10/10\", \"One of the best action thrillers ever made, Die Hard still rocks like a thunderstorm nearly twenty years after it was first released; often copied and arguably never, ever equalled, this film introduced the set-up of the lone cop/soldier/tough guy against a team of terrorists who have taken over a secured area. We'd get airports, airplanes, ships, buses, trains and many more, all in inferior films, but in Die Hard the action is set in a skyscraper, and director John McTiernan handles the claustrophobic tension with breathtaking skill. Bruce Willis also introduced the action hero as tough but eminently, realistically woundable; by the end he's a bloody, torn, shot and beaten mess. Obviously he survives near-impossible odds, be it falling through lift shafts, jumping off of exploding roofs and such and such, but he's no invincible Schwarzenegger type, and that's what makes him more likable and it's what gives the film real tension. Also, in Alan Rickman, we have the very best example of the refined European master criminal who would become a stereotype very quickly; funny, dangerous, clever and sophisticated, he's a villain you love to hate. The script is a dazzler, the action is brutal, effective and extremely exciting and the final half hour in particular cranks up the adrenaline to maximum effect. A classic.\", \"This movie is one action-packed ride. Bruce Willis (John McClane) is a New York cop coming to see his wife who has moved to L.A. with their children, hoping for a relaxing Xmas vacation. Instead, he gets a bunch of bad guys who have taken over the Nakatomi building which he and his wife are located in. He hides out, and takes out the bad guys one by one, all while trying to get police attention from the outside world. This movie is tense and full of action. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman put in outstanding performances. Willis manages to kill all of the bad guys and throw Rickman off the building. If you haven't seen it yet for whatever reason, now is the time to do so.\", \"Ahhh... There's nothing like the holiday season! Family reunions around the big table, presents for everybody and the kids playing all night long after Santa Claus' visit. Movies set in Christmas are always the kind of production which enhance our mood, touch us and make us feel better... Is it?   Not anymore. Because \\\"Die Hard\\\" is set exclusively on Christmas Eve, but it has nothing to do with Santa, elves or Frosty the Snowman. It simply is the catalyst of the blockbuster generation of the 90s and it's also one of the best action movies of all time.  The movie is about a group of European terrorists (they're German, actually) who plan to steal $600,000,000 from Nakatomi Plaza's vault, in Los Angeles. By the way, for those who didn't know it, the Nakatomi Plaza building is exactly the same than 20th Century Fox headquarters.  The group is led by Hans Gruber, one of the most interesting villains portrayed for a while and Alan Rickman's best role to date. What distinguishes Gruber from the other master criminals is his great intelligence, his apparently high level of education and erudition and his careful plotting of the heist. He always seems to know what he is doing, what he has to do, what is gonna happen and what to do if there is any hitch. He looks like a modern Phileas Fogg. This is almost scary, because we can ask ourselves: \\\"How could we beat this... machine?\\\"   Unfortunately for Gruber, there is only one little thing (and a considerable one) that he didn't count on: John McClane (the one and only Bruce Willis, in his breakthrough role). McClane is a NYPD cop who came to L.A. to visit his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), but he was able to escape himself from the terrorists when they invaded the building. Now, he's the only one able of defeating the terrorists and he's gonna have to use his brains, his guts and his muscles in order to stay alive and save everybody.  McClane is first depicted as a mildly-reclusive, word-avid cop, but he quickly becomes wild after the terrorists' takeover. And his heroic actions throughout the entire movie make him one of the coolest heroes of the last years, along with Indiana Jones and James Bond.  The action scenes are greatly orchestrated by action maestro John McTiernan (known at the time for \\\"Predator). Not only do they figure bloody battles, explosive gunfights and eye-popping pyrotechnic effects, but they're filmed in unique and interesting ways. Here are some examples: After Harry Ellis is shot, we can watch Gruber talking to the police via walkie-talkie... throughout holes made in Ellis' head. And there's also these scenes where McClane shoot two terrorists in the legs, making them literally blow out with blood.  Gunfights are unrelenting and we could believe that there were as many bullets shot in this film as in an entire war.  And for dessert, what about two great bombings inside the building itself? First, there is that unforgettable and visually-dazzling massive explosion made by McClane with a 'bomb chair' and, second, that epic roof bombing, which can be visible from the far other side of the city.  This is the great part of the visual. The less shining part is the light circles and ovals which constantly appear and disappear during nearly all the movie. This is very annoying and disturbing.  Other than Gruber and McClane, there are only two very interesting characters. The first one is Gruber's henchman Karl (Alexander Godunov). Just looking at him is dreadful. His eyes are aggressive, cold and piercing. And his indelible grimace render him menacing and serious. He's that kind of guy with whom it is preferable not to make angry.  The other interesting protagonist is Sgt. Powell (Reginald VelJohnson). He's the only contact that McClane has with the exterior from inside his glass pseudo-prison. Together, they develop a close relationship with each other during the operation although they never see each other until the end, in a very heart-warming scene.  \\\"Die Hard\\\" wins points for what it is and for what is has become. In 1988, it showed a whole new kind of action sub-genre: the die-hard genre, which is an action picture taking place in a restrained place, such as a skyscraper, a plane and so on... The hero was a real human being, instead of being a reckless soldier, a suave spy or a martial-arts expert. It is a great example of the near-perfect action picture. It's \\\"Die Hard\\\" that launched a wave of big-budget action pictures, making the 90s what we could call the 'yippee-ki-yay' generation.\", \"I'm a great fan of Bruce Willis and the fifty odd films which he has starred in, but his role as John McLane in the \\\"Die Hard\\\" series would have to be on the top of my list for the best Bruce Willis movie of all time. After watching and probably enjoying the film immensely, you realize how corny, but good the film was. The first few action sequences involve the ultimate bad guy, Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman in one of his more solid performances) and are great viewing. They really do set the tone for the rest of the movie, and even for the sequels to follow. But these first few scenes are upstaged by the brilliance of Bruce Willis in his many fight scenes, usually involving gunfire, glass breaking or some kind of explosion! These scenes are enjoyable and all lead to the explosive finale, which leads to a chopper going down, the roof of a building exploding, and a man falling 70 stories to his death. There's also plenty of comic relief in this film, with Argyle, McLanes' limo driver, being oblivious to the anarchy occurring above him whilst he is in the underground car park listening to music and chatting up ladies. Officer Powell, McLanes sidekick outside of the building, also provides a few good laughs. But the two main performances of Willis and Rickman take up mos of the screen time, and rightfully so, as these two characters are brilliant to watch. The Plot line is quite good for such an action-packed film, and it doesn't ever lose any of the intensity it starts out with, if it doesn't gain any that is! All in all, this is a film I recommend for anyone who doesn't take films too seriously, or just wants a good action packed film. Definitely one to put into your DVD or video collection at home.\", \"When you see this in the shops you can only think of that line, it's one of the true films to be an Action film from start to finish. The best part of this film is it's ages really well, you would think it was made only yesterday, it has one of the biggest stars in history of films Bruce Willis.  OK so on to the film, it starts like any other film and sets the scene for what is a roller coaster ride that will leave you wanting more at the end. In the beginning we see John Mcclane (Bruce Willis) on a plane on his way to Los Angeles, the reason he is going there is to meet his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia who looks really attractive in this film) and it's Christmas Eve.  He goes to the Nakatomi Corporation building which is where Holly works to see her and be there for his kids who he hasn't seen in a while, but during the time there he has abit of a fight with her and she gets called to give a talk, anyway John is in the bathroom insulting himself in the way how Bruce Willis does, and he ends up taking his shoes off (the person who he is sat next to on the plane says the best way to get over flying is to take your shoes off and walk bear foot and make fists with your toes...personally never tired it). During the time little does he know that a group of terrorists are planning on taking over the building (this all happens in the first 20 minutes or so).  The film then really starts to go into its own as we follow an average police officer from New York in LA trying to just to get home for Christmas, still more about this film. Upon noticing that the building is being taken over by terrorists John escapes and heads to the top floor with work is still going on, and sets off the fire alarm in an attempt to get the police there. When the terrorists find out that hes set the fire alarm off from the top floor they phone the police and tell them that its nothing to worry about and send someone up to kill him, John pleased with his attempt to get back up there looks out the window and swears at them for coming to his aid, then notices they turn around.  At this point they send someone up to take him out, and the person ends up getting killed, John having a wicked sense of humour (on both levels of the word) sends the dead body down the lift and takes as much as he can like the machine gun, and cigarettes as you do when your in that sort of situation, and tries on the shoes only to find they are too small. He also writes an amusing note on the persons jumper, meanwhile hes in the lift above the one that stopped taking notes on what hes up against.  Later on John goes to the roof of the building to transmit a cry for help to the police and has a fairly amusing conversation on to the police, anyway at this time he gets cut off due to being attacked by the other terrorists, and they choose to send a police officer to search to see if John was telling the truth, anyway the terrorists and John are having a shoot out in one of the offices, and to get the attention John uses his head he throws the body out of the window.  Now that he has some help the film moves onto a new level and the action increases more, as police road bloke outside and the FBI get involved the scale of this film (which by the way was made in 1988) starts to show. As John gets in situations and the action increases and has loads of twists and turns.  In my view this film has everything to be one of the best if not they best film out there, the scale of it is amazing and the cast is true great. Words cant really describe this film, you really have to watch it, but the film does leave you wanting more and does leave you wanting to watch the next one in the series. I could talk for days about this film and it's action sequences from the very small gun fights to the massive C4 explosion and the plot which doesn't seem to lose it's appeal even after watching it infinite times, and also it's feel good factor at the end when John is back with Holly and they are in the snow (lets face it you knew they would live) but it's got something that does make you want to watch it over and over. If they made more films like this then people would probably remember what cinema is about and we may have really memorable hero's like we use to.  This film should be a benchmark for ever other film that is out there trying to be an action film with a strong story, lets face it on paper it's a simple story terrorists want a building for money, they take it over, then John gets caught up in this mess...it's not hard really.  But then maybe people like it because it's simple, however I think they like it, or i I like it because it's so original and has never been done before, even Die Hard 2 and 3 they push the idea of films harder and further than before. They go that one more to make it fun and try to make the story still remain simple. It's one film you have to watch and it really should be in the top 250 on IMDb.\", \"In the Sixties, author Roderick Thorp wrote a novel, The Detective, which was turned into a movie, starring Frank Sinatra in the title role of Joe Leland. A sequel was written, in which Joe becomes trapped in the Claxxon Oil Corporation skyscraper after it is taken over by German terrorists and he has to rescue his daughter and grandchildren. Two decades later, the skyscraper becomes Nakatomi, the daughter becomes the wife, Leland becomes John McClane and the title becomes Die Hard.  To say that Die Hard sets new standards for action movies is like calling Bill Gates well off. The movie was so innovative and groundbreaking that dozens of rip-offs followed - Passenger 57, Under Siege, Cliffhanger, Sudden Death, et al. Hostage/terrorist movies were all the rage in the early Nineties.  Very few came close, because Die Hard had so many strong points, not least of which was Alan Rickman's marvellous performance, as Hans Gruber - also the name of the villain in Our Man Flint - the classically educated, smartly dressed terrorist leader. This is not some hammy guy in a chain-mail shirt with spikes on his gloves (Commando). Gruber would have been well at home on Wall Street.  His plan is to break into the vault on the 30th floor of the Nakatomi Plaza and take away $640million in negotiable bearer bonds. When he and his 12 European henchmen round up the office workers, who are enjoying a Christmas Eve party, one man slips away unnoticed. He is John McClane, a New York cop who has come to LA to settle down with his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). The odds are against him. But that's just the way he likes it.  The terrorists even have names. And we remember them. Most action movies these days have unidentified heavies, played by stunt men, who are lined up and knocked over.  In his battle to save his Holly, McClane is scorched, torched, beaten and blown up. He jumps off the roof and falls through air ducts. He uncovers deception and double-cross and picks broken glass out of his bare feet. No help comes from the naive and incompetent police, who are unable to get inside, and even less from the FBI.  McClane is not a supercop. He is an ordinary guy, who doesn't want a fight. When he is shot, he bleeds. He hurts. All he has are his pants, his vest, his gun - which runs out of ammo. This is the first realistic connection the audience has. When you don't want to be in McClane's position, it makes for much excitement.  John McTiernan, who's only previous mainstream movie was Predator, uses awesome photography and technical skills to give the film a truly polished and sophisticated look - it was nominated for four technical Academy Awards. He also allows for enough time for decent character development, most of which comes between McClane and a cop (Reginald Veljohnson) he makes friends with on a CB radio.  Die Hard manages to be heart-pounding and teeth-gritting every single time. And if you are one of those many people who have only ever been able to watch it on TV then now is definitely the time to rediscover a cool, classic and creative action picture.\", \"1988 and the undisputed number one action star was that Austrian body builder with the funny name with that monosylabic guy from ROCKY in second place . The thing I hated about Arnie and Sly is that their action movies were uninvolving with over blown battle scenes where the good guys never seemed to be in danger of dying . I was also going to bring the James Bond franchise into the conversation but the series became a parody when Bond stopped speaking with a Scottish accent sometime in the early 70s  DIE HARD is different to the other 80s action fests with John McLane being a fairly believable genre character . Okay he`s two dimensional but that`s got to be one dimension more than John Rambo who only exists to kill a lot of nasty commies so Americans can flock to the cinema . It`s also interesting to note that McLane`s wife is used in the plot which is slightly different from how most action films work out where the hero is normally single , but that`s probably because DIE HARD as more depth to it than many contemparies. Perhaps the biggest difference is that McLane is slightly flawed as we`re shown one scene where the hero gives the bad guys something they want , not something you`d see in a Arnie or Sly movie . I won`t mention the stunts or the tightly written set pieces or how compelling they are because everyone else has beat me to it , except to say that big explosions and gun fights often overwhelm an action movie ( Bond movies are a good example ) but here they occur from the narrative instead of someone cramming them into the script in a vain attempt to thrill the audience .   Normally I`d have a fit that an action blockbuster is well inside the IMDB top 250 but DIE HARD does deserve to be there since it`s the best movie of its type of its era .\", \"So many things made this movie great.  This movie made Bruce Willis immortal. He soaks up this character so well, it was him. The wise cracking cop who is entertaining because he is sarcastically funny not uttering stupid catch phrases. He is a cop who looks like a normal guy, middle age, loosing some hair with wife problems. (no faked up pretty face with shaved chest and oiled muscles). He is cool without pretending to be cool. He manages to thwart the bad guys while barefoot, man that is a great twist.  The plot is great because it does not fall perfectly in line for the hero. He stumbles, gets stuck and survives only by last minute thinking. It has plenty of action without getting ridiculous.  And the bad guys are great, smart sinister and well acted.  It is one of those movies that could play every weekend and would still be watched. Is one of those top 10 movies every guy should own.  Die hard 2 was OK but not as good as the original, I wish they would have stopped after 2. Die Hard 3 is poor.\", \"Every so often,a film comes along that resets the standard for it's genre.Die Hard did just that very thing for action films.Any film that inspires copycats and wannabes really does it's job well.Bruce Willis made a very successful transition from the small screen to the big screen as the everyday Joe forced into being the hero.This film has all the necessary ingredients to qualify it as a great action film.All you have to do is see it for yourself.Particularly well done is the performance of Alan Rickman as the chief villain,Hans Gruber.You can come up with good arguments for many action films as to which is the best all time,and this one is no exception.Well done.\", \"Quite possibly the best modern action movie since the classic \\\"Dirty Harry\\\", \\\"Die Hard\\\" simply rocks. Based on the interesting novel \\\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\\" by Roderick Thorp, \\\"Die Hard\\\" made headlines for its combination of a terrific cast, excellent script, amazing action sequences and superb direction. Headed up by screen favorite Bruce Willis (The Sixth Sense), \\\"Die Hard\\\" also features the talented Alan Rickman (Galaxy Quest) and Bonnie Bedelia (Needful Things). Directed by action veteran John McTiernan, the mastermind behind such action spectaculars as \\\"Predator\\\", \\\"The Hunt For Red October\\\", \\\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\\" (1999), and \\\"Die Hard With A Vengeance\\\".  In the role that shot him to stardom, Willis plays Detective John McClane, a hard-hitting cop from New York on Christmas Vacation in LA. He is there to visit his wife (whom he is separated from), Holly Gennaro, who recently got a great job working for the Nakatomi corporation and has permanently moved to Los Angeles with their two children. John arrives at Nakatomi Plaza expecting a fun Christmas party and a relaxing night. Man was he wrong! A few minutes after getting settled, twelve gun-toting Eastern Europeans take the entire 30th floor hostage. The supposed terrorists are headed up by the brilliant megalomaniac Hans Gruber (Rickman), who actually wants the $640 million dollars inside the floor's vault. Somehow, McClane escapes upstairs armed only with a handgun and starts causing a ruckus, slowly hunting down each well-equipped thug.  \\\"Die Hard\\\" succeeds is because it presents every challenge McClane has to face realistically and clearly. As the tension mounts, the ordeals for John become increasingly harder. First, it's just a terrorist. Then a whole slew of them. Later, it's the NYPD and even the FBI! Director McTiernan gives the film a good pace and makes the film work by showing that John isn't superhuman; he only uses his brain more than his gun. Also, screenwriters Jeb Stuart (The Fugitive) & Steven E. De Souza (48 Hrs.) add touches of humor that lighten up the viewer and classic one-liners (\\\"Yippy-Ki-Yay, !@#$\\\") that ignite the screen. Their subplots actually add to the story instead of overcomplicating it, especially one featuring good cop Sgt. Al Powell (Rejinald VelJohnson of TV's \\\"Family Matters\\\").  Overall, this movie was awesome. Willis is very believable and has significant screen presence. Character development is superb, and even though Stuart and De Souza leave some loose ends untied - like how a man gets hung with a chain and still comes back for more - the film remains to be an action classic. Note to Parents: the nudity, drug use, continual profanity, and extreme violence would make this a bad choice for kids under 13. Otherwise, see \\\"Die Hard\\\" ASAP! Overall Rating: *** Worth 9 out of 10 dollars ***\", \"On the night that John McClane (Bruce Willis), an NYC cop, is visiting his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) in a 40-story skyscraper, terrorist thieves seize control of the building. McClane manages to slip away unnoticed and singlehandedly works to take out the terrorists and save 30 or so hostages.  Fantastic! This ought to get anybody out of their seat and make them take notice! Once it gets going there is non-stop action and violence, and even entertaining exchanges between McClane and terrorist leader Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). The picture offers some good dialog, good thrills, some impressive special effects, and some good performances. I think this movie and its equally macho sequels would be a must for any action fan's video/DVD library.  McClane does sort of turn out to be a one-man army, but he's not exactly superhuman. He suffers wounds and injuries just like any normal human being, and he talks quite a bit. McClane's efforts are not appreciated by either the L.A.P.D. *or* the F.B.I., and his only support outside the building is from weary street cop Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson). The relationship between McClane and Powell is a well-developed one, and Willis and VelJohnson have good dialog as Powell offers McClane words of encouragement.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the superb performances by Rickman and Russian ballet dancer Alexander Godunov as the primary bad guys. These are thoroughly entertaining action movie villains, and Hans is actually more than one-dimensional. On the one hand, he's cold-blooded and cruel, yet he also enjoys dressing well and seems very cultured.  The only sour note is the abundance of the F-word (although, in retrospect, I might be swearing a blue streak if I were in the same frustrating situation) and the variety of truly moronic supporting characters in the film (the self-serving, coke-snorting yuppie Ellis (Hart Bochner), the foolish and brain-dead deputy police chief Robinson (Paul Gleason), the equally self-serving and pompous TV news reporter Thornburg (William Atherton), and the ignorant and overconfident FBI men (Robert Davi, Grand L. Bush).  But what a film it is. Entertaining for over two hours. While on the surface it seems like a real \\\"Guy's\\\" film, Bonnie Bedelia, as the estranged wife, has a decent role, although hers is the only prominent female role in the picture.  9/10\", \"One could claim that 1988's \\\"Die Hard\\\" is one of the most influential action movies ever made because it basically revolutionized one of the most copied (but never matched, at least in terms of quality) formulas: a loner, by some unique twist of fate, battles it out with an \\\"x\\\" number of terrorists in an enclosed environment.  By the time that \\\"Die Hard\\\" was released, the action movies were most often dominated by the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Chuck Norris. Star Bruce Willis, whose only notable credits at the time were television's \\\"Moonlighting\\\" and 1987's \\\"Blind Date,\\\" which was released the year before, was the unlikeliest of them all.  Willis was a wild card - an unlikely choice for the role of our hero \\\"John McClane\\\" - since he didn't have any action credits on his resume' and let's face it: Bruce Willis just didn't have the bulging biceps required for a role like this. But that's the beauty of his performance in this movie: he's an everyday guy, caught in a not-so-everyday situation.  On Christmas, McClane's estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) invites him from New York all the way out to Los Angeles to spend the holidays with the family. But it requires him to make a stop at the Nakatomi offices, which is having an after-hours Christmas party. Riding for the first time in a limo, he's introduced to the suave driver, Argyle (De'voreaux White), who gives him some pretty useful advice on trying to win over the wife.  At Nakatomi, things of course get off to a rough start for McClane, as he gets into an argument with the wife and is left to wallow in his misery. However, those problems are about to take a backseat to the real \\\"party\\\" - twelve terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (all-purpose bad guy Alan Rickman, perfectly cast) - seize control of the building and proceed to rob the Nakatomi building of its assets, most of which include negotiable bonds and other valuables. But they didn't count on the \\\"fly in the ointment\\\" (pain in the a**) to make things hell for these so-called party crashers.  Certainly one of the best known action movies ever, \\\"Die Hard\\\" did receive the scorn of critics upon its 1988 summer release, but the audiences sung a completely different tune.  The film was most often praised for the production, with the brand-new Fox Plaza office tower serving as the fictional Nakatomi building. It was also praised for the energetic and skillful direction of John McTiernan, whose most notable credit was the action-sci-fi thriller \\\"Predator,\\\" which was released the year before and starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Bruce Willis was the perfect actor for this performance, since he brings the wit and vulnerability to a role like this one. If Stallone or Schwarzenegger were in this movie, I'm sure the effect would have been a lot different.  Personally, I think \\\"Die Hard\\\" is one of the greatest action movies ever, up there close to my favorite action movie of all time, \\\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\\" Like Indiana Jones in that film, \\\"Die Hard\\\" had an Everyman cast in the role; McClane, like Indiana Jones, wasn't a larger-than-life musclebound grotesque: he was a real guy that you cared about, who got hurt, and had real feelings.  That's why I think both of these movies have sort of stood the test of time as becoming what they are best known for today: action classics, and they're here to stay, ladies and gentlemen.  10/10\", \"\\\"Die Hard\\\" is the prototype type for the modern action film. Since it's also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing. \\\"Die Hard\\\" is lean, mean, and doesn't contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction, the action, the story, the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to big-budget action movie perfection. Since \\\"Die Hard\\\" was first released in 1988, it's difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn't follow the basic structure and format of \\\"Die Hard\\\" . . . or, for that matter, is better than \\\"Die Hard\\\".  \\\"Die Hard\\\" is about John McClane (Bruce Willis, in one of his all-time best film performances), a basically good, honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures. Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists, led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), have taken over the office building in which Holly is working, and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles, it's up to John McClane to save the day . . . .  Kudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza -- the film is tight, electrifying, and clever, which is something few action films can ever claim. The story isn't completely believable, but it's believable enough, and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over. There's also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what's going to happen next . . . and the surprises don't come out of left field, but are actually clever and well thought-out. (The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.) Simply put, \\\"Die Hard\\\" is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written. McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action. A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless, breakneck pace, without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films, \\\"Die Hard\\\" knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene, and that's why it stands out so clearly from them all. With \\\"Die Hard\\\", John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.  As for the acting, it's darn near close to perfect. Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane. As played by Willis, McClane's a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane's also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure. There's more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero. Fortunately, the role was given to Bruce Willis, who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stone-cold heroism. The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation, and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease, like most stereotypical action heroes -- well, not only does it make the character much more believable, it's darn brilliant. (The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan one-liner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.) There's only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match; Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.  Also worthy of mention is Alan Rickman's performance as the villain Hans Gruber. The Machiavellian Gruber would've been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenery-chewing Bond villain . . . fortunately, Rickman doesn't travel the easy route. Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero. He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve, and is so convincing at giving this impression, it's hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand. Other actors probably could've played Gruber fairly well, but Rickman makes Gruber one of the all-time great villains. As for the rest of the cast, they're all pretty good. Bonnie Bedelia does a nice job as John's soon-to-be-ex-wife Holly -- she plays her with enough smarts and feistiness to break the usual \\\"damsel in distress\\\" mold. It's also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason, who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson, pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero. The character is stupid to a fault, and he's wonderful because of it.  \\\"Die Hard\\\" is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly. There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film. Is \\\"Die Hard\\\" one of the best overall movies ever made? Probably not. But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film.

I originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by Tony Scott and I have become very interested in his work after Man On Fire had such a profound impact on me. Before I start my review, let me first say this...it's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner, yet the writers and Scott chose a different approach.  Plot:  Simply stated, it's not boring. Most Hollywood movies give 'tried and true' plots that they know will connect with people, often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit. This plot was one of the more interesting ones I had seen in a while. Just for reference, I recently watched 'The Weather Man' and 'Lord of War' and while I will say that these movies are excellent, and I enjoyed them both tremendously, both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told. They don't take any chances whatsoever, and they are extremely predictable after you've watched a fair amount of American films. Domino's plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking, \\\"oh man, they're screwed now\\\". And I feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films. It has a lot of depth to it, in my opinion, and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it. Overall, this is what kept me so interested in the movie.  Characters:  I felt that the characters were accurate. Knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman, who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was. It was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that.  Choco was also very believable, his use of Spanish in inappropriate situations, his reactions to Domino's lack of affection, as well as his jealousy issues within the team...they all rang true to me, which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic.  Rourke's character was the least interesting to me, but it still rang true to me. He seemed like an ordinary guy, trying to make ends meet. I hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that's what I got out of it. He did a very good job of showing Ed in an Average Joe kind of way that has made his mistakes, yet is still trying to live.  Claremont/Ladies: I believe that they provided much needed 'heart' to the story. They weren't just people who are out getting money to buy a Bentley, these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal. You could empathize with them because, to them, this child's illness was a problem with no other solution. These characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help.  The mobsters: They made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can. And I really liked that part. They also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting.  Christopher Walken/90210 guys:  They provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie. From Walken's awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the 90210 guys being has-beens. Their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable.  Cinematography....yes....the cinematography. This is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans. But in my opinion I thought it was genius, the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion. I considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement, just like anything else. I both applaud and congratulate Scott, the editor, the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie. Not only did they go far and above with its presentation, they went that much further. The use of colors, both extremely light and extremely dark provided the 'look' of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob, bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn't as peachy or 'clean' as everyone else. If you notice, in times of less stress or conflict, there were very few camera tricks if any at all. This shows that Scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren't just doing it for the heck of it. I realize that most people who watched this movie weren't expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but I think it was great that Scott took this approach. Hollywood films have grown predictable and bland. Most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns. And I'm glad that Scott tried to make something different.  Granted, this movie isn't for everyone, but to say it's trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I'm glad that I spent the money for it. I would recommend this to all, but I'm sure it will only hit a chord with few. I must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'sphere of MTV' won't appreciate this movie, but I think many people will. We should all try to enjoy it for the fact that Scott and co. took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique. And with that in mind, I think he succeeded tremendously.\", \"Ah, Domino is actually a breath of fresh air, something new to the cinema world. I enjoyed the movie a lot because of the intricate plot, the varied characters, and the intense camera effects. I've seen some complain about the camera work and, in fact, according to the creators themselves, the flashy and wild shots were all the culmination of mistakes made through time. All of what you see was the desired effect. Perhaps some complain because something quite like this has never been done before, although that's what sets it apart. In a deeper aspect, what you are seeing is just how Domino sees things through her eyes, think about it.  When it comes to the story, I don't see anything quite bad about it. Despite it's \\\"messy\\\" nature, according to some, it is in fact just a rapid form of storytelling. The plot really isn't all that hard to follow, if you actually focus on what's going on. Maybe it's just me because I see movies from many different aspects such as the acting, the plot, etc. I'm no \\\"interpreter\\\" or anything who picks movies apart, it just comes to me. With that said, I believe this is quite an excellent movie indeed, despite it's future as a cult-classic, blockbuster, or whatever.  And the characters, well there's no doubting how varied the cast is. I believe the cast is excellent as they all do fine jobs portraying their characters effectively, that's what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen. The characters are all very unique and a plus is that you get to witness a small piece of each one of their lives, setting them apart even further. Basically, I personally loved the cast and characters.  All those who bash and burn this film perhaps just don't see it as I do, or it just doesn't appeal to them. No matter, this is a great film in it's own right, no, it's a great film period.\", \"When I rented Domino I was expected it to be very dumb. I hate films that have really flashy editing and cinematography and Domino also just got very bad reviews. The only reason I watched it is because I like have liked Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken, and Tony Scott on other occasions. I also just enjoy based on fact adventure stories. Yes the editing and cinematography were frantic, the story was weak, and the acting was mediocre, but I still loved this film for some bizarre reason. Domino was very, very entertaining and often very funny. It was horribly underrated when it was released I think because everyone wanted more of an emotional journey like Scotts last film Man on Fire and instead just got wonderful entertainment. I actually understand why everybody hated Domino so much, even though I loved it and recommend it.\", \"Kiera Nightly moved straight from the P&P set to this action movie... she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically. A great success in Love Actually and as Lizie in Jane Austen's classic, she is, once again, \\\"having a go\\\". Just as her bikini clad warrier woman in King Arthur was more skin than muscle, it is difficult to imagine this delicate frame standing up to a bounty hunters life... but then this is exactly what Domino Harvey (the real one) did, and I (being one of Nightly's biggest fans) believe she carries if off.  Stuff....  * 90210 (for the non American world) is the post code of Beverly hills in LA, where all the film stars live. * Domino Harvey father's mostfamous film was Manchurian Candidate (which appears in the film). * Domino Harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the film came out in June 2005, after having been arrested for drug dealing. She had just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be inlcuded in the film. * Kiera Knightly alludes to Domino Harvey's sexuality in her interview with Lucy Liu.  If you find this film a bit far fetched, then check out Domino Harvey, as the facts are more amazing than the fiction.\", \"Domino is a great movie. It's about a young woman names Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) who becomes a bounty-hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle. She joins with two fellow hunters (Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez) and the adventures begin. The script is good. Very down-to-earth and realistic with the tone of the film. The only problem I had with this movie is that it concentrates on the different things that they do, instead of the character of Domino.  Even with that, Kiera Knightley gives a fierce performance. She shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance. Mickey Rourke follows up his Oscar-Worthy performance in 'Sin City' with another tough-guy performance. Edgar Ramirez really doesn't do anything except speak Spanish every once in a while and stare at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi gives a good supporting performance. Mo'Nique was herself, although she did surprise me on one particular scene. Lucy Liu has great chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her scenes with her.  The best thing about the movie though, is the direction. Tony Scott's fast-paced style really brings the movie to life. The cinematography is some of the best, I've ever seen. It takes a regular movie and puts on acid. All the blacks are blacker, the whites are brighter, and it has a sort of green glow to it. The action scenes are exhilarating.  OVERALL: If you liked Sin City & Man on Fire, you'll like Domino.\", \"As soon as I knew Keira Knighteley being in this flick, I said \\\"I have to watch this movie\\\". She's the undisputed main character, Domino, a bounty hunter. Her \\\"job\\\", as the \\\"no action\\\" scenes would teach us, reflects her rebel, violent attitude to life. I have to admit that it's the very first time that I watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters' hands. So, this stomped me a bit. Anyway, for all the John Woo's fans, there are helicopters falling down, explosions, gunfire as if it would rain, and a lovely Keira that shoots with two machine guns, one per hand. The cast is absolutely brilliant. Going beyond Keira, which in this movie is a real tomboy, pretty much different from the lovely action figure we're used to see, Mickey Rourke is back, with his usual slap-throwing face and his potent body. Christopher Walken makes his job pretty well, as a reality show producer.  Let's go to the contents: this movie has a journalistic shape. The talk show scene is \\\"disgustingly\\\" real. Anyone that watched that load of . . . you-know-what, can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations. As well as the producer, when Domino's mom says that the reality that should show Domino's life is \\\"trash; no offense\\\", he answers \\\"I don't take it like an offense\\\". This movie portrays a difficult life. Domino, coming from a world that didn't want her, Ed (Mickey Rourke), a bounty hunter \\\"not so bounty\\\", Choco (the third guy of the band), which family is (using Ed's words), \\\"the correctional institutes he's been\\\", and Alf, the driver/bomber coming from Afghanistan during the Russian occupation. This bunch of people represents in some way the humankind born \\\"without the shirt\\\"; unlucky, violent, and with nothing to lose, excepts their (as they would consider) miserable lives. The intro of the movie says that it is \\\"inspired by true story . . . more or less\\\", so I couldn't possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true. Anyway, going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons (which could have been \\\"added\\\" to make the film easier to see, and be classified as an action movie), the characters' story is too realistic to be \\\"edulcorated\\\".   The interaction between the characters is various, well studied, and definitely not boring. What hasn't convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist (Lucy Liu, sober as never in her acting career). It represents only the reason by which Domino starts telling her story (and that's a story). Probably, the only \\\"con\\\", in a movie with a lot of \\\"pros\\\".   All in all: This isn't \\\"SWAT\\\". The characters are crafted; they have an identity, a shape. They have a name and a surname (not just \\\"Gamble\\\" and \\\"Street\\\"). It's the case to say, it's the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet.\", \"I doubt much of this film is based on a true story. At the beginning it says based on a true story, sort of. I bet the only truth to it was there was an ex-model turned bounty hunter possibly named Domino.  Anyways, it begins with Domino talking to Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Domino is being interrogated about what she knows about a theft of 10 million dollars. Through flashbacks, we see Domino as a child, then as a model, and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter. She basically tells 2 other bounty hunters off, Ed and Choco. They let her join the group. She's tough, can use any kind of weapon, and will use her good looks if needed.  They get involved with a scam that Clarmont, a bailsman, has going. Along the way, the group starts a reality TV show, and that's where Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green become involved. They are sort of like hosts and must have been really desperate to appear in this.  I thought the story was entertaining and it had some laughs. The editing didn't bother me. There's also a lot of violence, mainly using guns, and blood. It could have been a little shorter.  FINAL VERDICT: Good enough to watch.\", \"I'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum, and many of the reviews. I think Tony Scott made a good movie here. Yes, it is highly stylized, flashy and over the top, but it is very entertaining. I'm glad at least Ebert and Roeper agrees with me :)   This movie may not be for anyone, but if you like over-the-top, dark humor, cool action and dialog, you should see it.   I've previously seen Scott's Man on Fire, Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State - all good movies, but I like this one more. It's like a roller-coaster ride, with great soundtrack selections, visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be pg13, it is nice to see that someone isn't afraid of showing nudity, gory violence, and have explicit dialog.  It doesn't hurt that Keira is super-hot, and even shows nipples in this one, either...\", \"I rented domino on a whim, not even knowing it was inspired by a true story, and even though it's the least likely and true biopic you'll probably see. i found it to be rather awesome.  With Richard Kelly writing he crams together a mass of plots and narratives into 2 hours of pure entertainment. And once you've seen it more than once you get it and appreciate it.   Domino is a model turned bounty hunter who leaves the perfect Hollywood life to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career. It has an edgy acid trip style provided by director Tony Scott. And with fast paced music and editing, it provides the visual flare to keep your attention, with slick performances and unexpected comedy, the movie is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience.   I suggest it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained at the same time for 2 hours.\", \"If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie. This movie contains what Hemmingway described as the \\\"iceberg effect\\\". On the surface, its simply a cache of random movie clips smashed together to make a movie. If this would be written in a book, it would be a short story, because the action in the movie is very fast paced, and unless you actually try to catch it, the reasoning behind the plot (along with some subtle foreshadowing) can very well pass you by. Definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate. Experimental Cinematography barely describes this movie. The camera-work and post production add much to the overall flavour of the film, making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others (something to be desired in American movies as of late). Although, at some parts it may get a little raunchy, gruesome and too heavy for some audiences, the movie never becomes completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the movie that I would write off as \\\"needs improvement\\\" is the soundtrack selection. No movie is ever good without a fitting soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite fitting, the opening is a little too long, and the other rap songs in the film really could have been replaced with something more appropriate (heavy, grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have made this film a real trip). The flooding of imagery and dynamic... color palettes adds another \\\"artistic\\\" aspect to it, also combined with the events that happen throughout the film, this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand. However, that also makes it much more of a desirable film to watch, and not one you'll quickly get bored of. 8.5/10\", \"If you find yourself in need of an escape, something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to be lost in another world, Domino will satisfy that need. This is entertainment, after all! The plot keeps your brain in motion - one of those movies (like Usual Suspects) where you want to see it a second time to figure it all out. I wondered about Domino Harvey herself, how her life became of interest to Hollywood. As for the acting, lots of celebrity appearances not shown in the trailers. And any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well. Not once did I think of Kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume. And granted, Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke well and often, but here, despite the violence, he shows signs of being capable of caring for other people.\", \"\\\" Domino \\\" has been widely condemned on this site for its frenetic editing style and \\\" sickening \\\" photography. It's detractors cite its superficiality and criticize its deployment of \\\" style over substance\\\" I couldn't disagree more. I believe that \\\" Domino \\\" represents the absolute height of Tony Scott's film-making career.   After having created the dominant Hollywood action movie style throughout the late eighties and early nineties Tony Scott has moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of cinema. As early as \\\"Crimson Tide\\\" Scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters- the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict on board a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with dutched-angle framing. This was then carried through to \\\" Enemy Of The State\\\" and \\\"Spy Game\\\" which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively.   \\\" Man On Fire\\\" was an extreme departure , a move into an expressionist more painterly aesthetic. Here Scott used an antiquated hand cranked camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive rage . Although not entirely successful it introduced the techniques which were to find their full expression in \\\" Domino\\\"  Couched in the framing device of an FBI interrogation \\\" Domino\\\" presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter via her narrated disjointed fragments of memory. She grasps at memories as we all do- in fragments, flashes and brief snatches. As Domino relays her story verbally Scott relays it visually illustrating not only the events which she describes but also the point of view which guides them. She does have \\\" traces of mescaline\\\" in her system but her individual vision is anyway Unusual -that of an woman who eschewed the life of luxury for bounty hunting.   It is when Domino begins to relate the events which lead to her captivity that Scott really lets rip. Together with Cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of contemporary Americana. Gradually we begin to realize that unusual though she may be Domino is no more disjointed than the \\\"90210\\\" culture she has rejected. As she wades through this cultural melange Scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence which it destroys through the underprivileged children which the narrative introduces. Ultimately Scott portrays their salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal trip.   To criticize this movie for being overly stylized is akin to criticizing a Picasso or a Pollock for not representing that which is recognizably human. Like any great painting the meaning in \\\" Domino\\\" is in the surface and the surface is everything.   I am not in any way associated with Scott Free but have always been and will continue to be a huge admirer of Tony Scott's work\", \"My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT *dizzying* CHOP} My--my--my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {EDIT. CUT. Playback}  Never have I seen a director take so much flack for his style before. By now it is evident that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott's choppy, flashy, dizzying editing technique. If I have to choose between loving it and hating it, I'd say I love it. It was borderline distracting at times, but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality (even if it borrows heavily from MTV videos).  This stylistic edge manifests itself as Keira Knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter Domino Harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy. Otherwise she plays her poorly because I pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her, no matter how much she suffered. We follow Domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew become tangled up in the FBI and suddenly has a reality show contract under Christopher Walken's TV production company (what is Christopher Walken doing in every film, by the way?). I guess that is a clever film technique, because now Tony Scott is free to use as much flashy MTV/Reality Show editing footage as he likes. It becomes a pastiche of MTV culture at this point.  It followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapid-fire pace, with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence. There are some funny jokes; it's all very modern and surreal at the same time. It's a mess, but it's a rather enjoyable mess. It is ultimately flawed in so many ways (the actors try too hard to make their characters \\\"cool\\\", for one) but it works. I give it a weak 7/10 which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of movie-goers who graded this film \\u0097 but I feel it had some good ideas and executed them well.  7 out of 10\", \"This is a bad movie. Not one of the funny bad ones either. This is a lousy bad one. It was actually painful to watch. The direction was awful,with lots of jumping around and the green and yellow hues used throughout the movie makes the characters look sickly. Keira Knightly was not convincing as a tough chick at all,and I cannot believe Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid. The script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across a chalkboard. If you haven't seen it,don't. You are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel .I have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults. This one is just a waste of time.\", \"I am, as many are, a fan of Tony Scott films. When this movie came out I had high hopes that it would be like 'Man On Fire'. To find out that the movie it's the furthest thing from it! The story was treading water from the get go, and the choice of Mickey Rourke was not such such a good idea. And the whole 'arm'scene was too gratuitous!   The movie is centered around Kiera Kinghtly, and this movie reveals that she'll never become a movie star! The movie brought some of the worst acting ever.  I like Tony Scott's direction 'n all, but this takes the whole friggin cake! Sorry Ton, 1 out of 10!\", \"Now I had the best intentions when watching this one. I like some of Tony Scott's work, also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie, even though I heard otherwise from other people. But this was simply hopeless.   In my humble opinion, Tony Scott was trying too hard. It was all just too much. Allow me to elaborate.   Miss Knightley was overacting, and not in a good way. The people who did perform well, were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez, and Christopher Walken, but their screen time just wasn't able to save the movie.   There were a few scenes that jumped out in their originality, yet somehow it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer. A certain tune was used around 4 times, which really started to bug after the second time. I'm a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once.   Also, the editing really went out on this one, as the cutting rate is rather high. Oh, and the repetitive echoing of some of Keira's lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second, third, fourth time, and so on.   Basically, my opinion is that if you want to see an action-flick that is high-paced and \\\"somewhat\\\" funny, and you don't care about everything I mentioned above, you might like it.   (On a side note: I'm not a Keira Knightley fan.)\", \"What do you get when you mix a lump of clich\\u00e9s with a directionless pacing and a group of characters who you don't care about and a failed attempt at creating an appealing visual style and an even bigger lump of clich\\u00e9s and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget? Why, you get one of the most intolerably unwatchable movies ever made! I'm referring, of course, to Domino.  Here are some things that people might say during the viewing of this movie:  \\\"Ooh, wow, the storyline is told out of sequence, that hasn't been done a billion times before. And much more skillfully than in this movie.\\\"  \\\"Wow, look at all of the flashing lights and grainy film texture and elaborate transitions! The director is trying so hard to make things look arty and to establish a visual style! It's just too bad that none of these effects add anything to the movie or make sense with the scenes they're in, and it's also too bad that most of them come across as irritating!\\\"  \\\"I've heard that exchange of dialogue in about twenty thousand movies before!\\\"  \\\"I've seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies before!\\\"  \\\"This one too!\\\"  \\\"Uh, didn't they reveal this 'plot twist' about half an hour ago? Was that supposed to be surprising?\\\"  \\\"If this movie is supposed to be showing a 'tough chick' going around kicking ass... when why doesn't she do very much of it?\\\"  \\\"I can't believe how unoriginal this dialogue is.\\\"  \\\"How long is this thing? I feel like I've been watching it for over four hours already.\\\"  \\\"I have no idea what just happened, but also, I don't particularly feel motivated to try to figure it out.\\\"  \\\"Is this over yet?\\\"  \\\"I want my money back.\\\"  \\\"The songs in this soundtrack feel so misused here.\\\"  \\\"It's ironic that all of the cursing they use actually detracts from the impact of each one.\\\"  \\\"UGH.\\\"  And, finally: \\\"I might have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to me.\\\"  In summation, this movie is a failure in nearly every aspect. Avoid watching it at all costs. If your house is on fire and this movie is playing in the only room that isn't flammable, you should seriously consider being burned alive instead.  (If I sound bitter, it's because I just spent over two hours watching this movie and, uh, I didn't enjoy it very much.)\", \"how can you take her hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with *that* accent? It's absurd. Apart from that, the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky, the plot is a shallow, boring, confused gangster-movie rehash and the acting is unconvincing. The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and confused. The film ever shows you THINGS THAT DON'T REALLY HAPPEN and then later says \\\"that didn't really happen, this happened\\\" - see the (apparent) killing of the (fake) 'first ladies'. What have we seen the first, wrong, sequence of events for then?  Terrible choice in casting, a convoluted, messy plot and a headache-inducing directorial style. 1/5.\", \"What of Domino did I hate over everything, and I mean everything, else? Perhaps it was the overall glorification of being a bounty hunter; maybe it was the sexism masquerading as an involving and interesting study of a hard bodied female lead character; maybe it was the mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints or the manner in which it takes an actress like Lucy Lui; who deserves a lot better than this junk; and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light cannot directly hit with the same dumb look on her face. Maybe it's the editing; that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as they're uttered by people like Kiera Knightly who, if you buy as a bounty hunter, then you'll probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in 2012.  Nobody comes away from Domino with any sort credibility, absolutely nobody at all. It is a painful and misguided experience, taking inspiration from things like Natural Born Killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them. The principal question is: 'Was Domino supposed to be some kind of comedy?' what with its hilariously bad lead uttering certain lines that desperately want us to think she's coming across as 'tough' but really, she resembles more an arrogant fifteen year old girl on her first day at public school, attempting to impress her peers. There are things you genuinely don't know how to react to, whether they're supposed to be funny or not. If it is supposed to be a comedy, that begs the next question: 'Is the life of a bounty hunter really the sort worth exploiting for laughs?' I don't think so.  The film opens with the title card 'Based on a true story........sort of.' If that's supposed to be some sort of post-modernist technique that enables director Tony Scott to bend and manipulate the story of Domino Harvey for his own unique purpose, then you're simply on another planet. Truth is, in that one opening quote the film identifies the subject matter and the original text before completely copping out and saying 'sort of' which I guess is supposed to enable them to make Domino older than she should be and appear on Jerry Springer. Following this, we learn of Domino's relationship with her father who died in the film when when she was ten or something; here is the first use of the 'sort of' cop out as in real life she was just four. But if the film had gone by reality's dates then her entire drive would've been born out of the death of........her goldfish.  We are then thrust into action with Ed Mosbey (Rourke); Domino (Knightley) herself and would-be love interest Choco (Ram\\u00edrez). During the scene, an American mother is pinned down via gunfire in her own caravan in the back end of nowhere as she pleads for her son's life to be spared. What a really misguided opening; presenting its three leads as nasty people who break into trailers, fire off weapons at innocents we don't know anything of and come close to shooting their pet dogs.  The immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads, a feeling of 'No, why are you doing this? Why is this happening?' Bad seeds are planted and, wouldn't you know it, they stick. The film is painful to watch, excruciating even; as these three mug their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in Beverly Hills 90210. Here is another daft post-modernist slant, people playing themselves and that 'sort of' Joker card being played again. Christopher Walken even pops up in a really stupid role that reeks of Robert Downey Jr's Natural Born Killers character.  So as the film plods on and Domino is cast into Ed and Choco's gang, purely for her good looks I might add, it appears amidst the plot to do with fake driver's registration I.Ds or something that Choco and Domino may have feelings for one another. The problem is, as each performer is doing such a bad job in their respective character; there is no chemistry and no feeling between the two; the film isn't a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place? Does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up? If there is any 'feeling' between Choco and Domino, it exists on such a small, tiny, minimalist scale that you have to ask why it's even included.  So then the film feels the need to crank things up narrative-wise. We find out the reason for the fake I.Ds that are linked to someone else and a guy talks on a cell phone in a sound proof bubble. The sound proof bubble I can believe but how does he get his phone under the water and into the bubble in the first place without it becoming flooded? He must've swam really quickly \\u0096 double the speed of the film's fasted edit which means something in the region of .01 of a second. Yeah, sure. The film's story becomes both too complicated and just plain arbitrary before resorting to a really dumb climax in which more stuff blows up. Plus, there's a really distasteful scene to do with a wall chart full of new ethnicities and the film's comedy runs SO dry, that it has to resort to the \\\"Jerry, Jerry!\\\" chant whilst people are on a popular American talk show. When did we last laugh at \\\"Jerry! Jerry!\\\"? when we were, say, seven years old? I came away feeling sad and depressed at such a film's existence.\", \"Tony Scott has never been a very good director, but every film he's made after \\\"Crimson Tide\\\" seems to bring him one step closer to being the inarguable worst working today (Michael Bay may fall into the same category, but at least his big, dumb, delusional epics entertain on some primally perverse level). And like other overblown Hollywood biopics (\\\"De-Lovely\\\" and \\\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,\\\" for instance) chronicling the lives of pretentious, overrated, or outright shallow ciphers given an aura of \\\"mystique\\\" by a society that thrives on the juicy behind-the-scenes details, \\\"Domino\\\" is a film that begins with little potential, and dashes that infinitesimal amount before the sixty-minute mark. With an already-distended running time of 128 minutes, the film feels twice as long, and spending time with characters this obnoxiously superficial and forgettable (unlike the superior \\\"Rules of Attraction,\\\" Scott's attempts to tinge the proceedings with irony via Domino's smug, self-aware-rich-girl voice-over only draws attention to the film's sledgehammer cluelessness) becomes an act only masochists could find pleasurable. The story? Spoiled-upper-crust-babe Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley, in an ersatz-badass performance as shallow as her gorgeous looks) is sick of the shallow lifestyles of the rich and famous in Los Angeles, and accosts gruff bounty hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez to learn a more exciting trade; along the way, there are double-crosses, shootouts, media attention (courtesy of a tongue-in-cheek Christopher Walken, phoning in his trademark sleazebag), and laughable hints at romance. Scott cuts the film together in segments that rarely last more than a few seconds, cranking up the resolution to make the film a neon-drenched nightmare that's frankly unpleasant to watch--if Scott's given an opportunity to shakily frame an image, ghost it, or distort it in some way, he will; but all this tacky stylistic overload overwhelms what little plot, characterization, and suspense the film has (to say nothing for its, ehm, \\\"entertainment\\\" value). Most of the characters come off as either contemptible or stereotypical, oftentimes both (observe the unbearable, several-minute segment where an African-American introduces a new list of racial categorizations on \\\"Jerry Springer\\\"), and I found myself wishing they would all get the \\\"tails\\\" end of our protagonist's coin by the end. \\\"Domino\\\" is utter, unmitigated trash--whatever interest in this individual Scott hoped to inspire in his audience, it is lost in a sea of migraine-inducing neon pretension a few minutes in.\", \"I was very excited about this film when I first saw the previews. Normally I see a preview this good and I buy the film outright. Something told me to... you know watch it first. I'm glad I did. Keira Knightley ruined all future films for me with this role. In the 2nd Pirates movie when it came out I went to see it. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated her more for it. I think that had to do with her hair and having to cut it short for Domino.  Domino who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still don't really know or care. I don't know who she was in real life or who she was in this film. I didn't care about her character and even Keira getting partically naked didn't make it worth the movie. The direction was definitely lacking. The writing was trite and shallow. The editing was horrible. I don't mind the style so much as the poor overuse of it. There's a place for it. Good examples of choppy, MTV style, colorful editing (not sure if there's an official name) would be Fight Club; just off the top of my head. Even Enemy of the State had a semi similar editing style at parts. It was used tastefully and wasn't used as a crutch. I mean this is the same guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott please give me my time back.  I understand there are many people who liked this movie. I guess the idea that you'll either completely love this movie or completely hate it is a fair assessment. Frankly, I hate it.\", \"It's rare that I come across a film this awful, this annoying and this irritating. It is without doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen.  The plot, when it's not a blur of confusing and pointlessly over flashy editing, is ludicrous. Why did Domino become such a bad-ass tough bitch? Because her gold fish died when she was a kid and this \\\"traumatic\\\" event left her emotionally stunted, and hating everyone. When the dialogue is not clich\\u00e9d or banal, it's littered with laughable lines such as: \\\"There are three kinds of people in this world: the rich... the poor... and everyone else\\\". At one point the bounty hunters have some guy tied up in the back of their bus who has a combination number tattooed on his arm. Because of a confusing mobile phone call, instead of rolling his sleeve up and just reading the number, they blow off his arm with a shotgun. At another point, the bounty hunters take a bomb to a meeting arranged with the mafia and threaten to set the bomb off unless the mafia let them go!? Clearly not going to the meeting would have been just too easy.  Keira Knightley is unconvincing and dreadfully miscast. Mickey Rourke does manage to salvage some credibility from this mess.  I have enjoyed some of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance being one, but all I could think while suffering this drivel was that it must have been made by a complete idiot.\", \"I do not know if this movies problems are more the fault of Direction or Script. As you will see in many reviews the editing style is way overdone. It is absolutely distracting and without substance, which could be considered a good thing if you look at some of the quotes from the movie. I do not write many reviews here, but felt this movie was so awful that it deserved comment. Movies like this erode at Movie making as an Art form. Movies like this one show more and more clearly that the current Reality focus in cinema is revealing the quality of the characters behind them. People hone there craft, there 5 senses, and there business sense - overlooking there own inner life. However I do not put blame on them, it is more and more the unfortunate condition of this age - qualified by films like this one. But by proxy these Manufacturers I would dare not call Artists vomit there lack of inner life or regard onto the screen - diffusing it to everyone. A story of bounty hunters, guns guns and more guns, heavy handed flaunting of sex - for the oh so popular actress (did they write the lap dance scene after they signed her?), over saturated, over exaggerated, one liners, non-linear plots. All different and yet all the same. Annoying overwhelming music to push the emotion down your throat. A story? a development of character? or just withheld, missing information, revealed at the end to create the *effect* of a story - as if one took place. It altogether lacks anything remotely resembling subtlety. It is a caricature of stereotypes and genre. Where are the films with Awareness? What about subtlety of sound and music that you are not even aware is there? What about the depth of a look? What about editing with a point about mind and consciousness? yes even in action films this can happen. Sure they have honed a craft; but what use is it without soul or wisdom? of insight into the human condition? Can the people who commented and said that this is an apogee of art, or compare this to Picasso and others - I say put this next to Gandhi or the Godfather, even the original trilogy of star wars or the lord of the rings; then look me in the face and say it again. It is a good crew, but they need some help with depth and story. I hope they get it because I like the crews previous work. better luck next time.\", \"this film is really bad....... no i mean really really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state, besides that he is one of the worse directors of all time. what appalled me the most is Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) did the screenplay to this. now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has learnt his lesson.  now i love Mickey Rourke's new roles but i cant even like him in this because of the terrible story and look of it. don't get me wrong i still love Mickey Rourke but he has made a few accidence's in his time and this is one of them. i don't know what to say about Keira knightly, i think she's a little too overrated. i just cant feel for her in films.  all in all this film is bad. thats it....... 1/10.......j.d Seaton\", \"supposedly based on the life of Domino Harvey a model turned bounty hunter. I'd say 95 % is fabricated. I always keep an open mind when it comes to movies, however, this movie lost its chances when it became apparent it had narration throughout the film, something i can't stand, and to top it off, the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant b!ch I just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head. it's too incoherent, too flashy and way too boring, it's a who gives a crap kinda story, and i really think that big time directors need to make movies based on their own or a writer's own imagination not something based on some ignorant snobby brat's life.\", \"If it smells like garbage and if it looks like garbage, it must be garbage. This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. Tony Scott's poor directing style puts shame to an already uninteresting and slightly untrue story of Domino Harvey's life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing to watch. Certain aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It seems that all of the action scenes were loosely strung together by poor plot points and horrible acting. Keira Knightley does get totally naked in this one though. That is the one and only upside to this film. If you want to see her naked just fast forward the movie until about an hour and a half into it and you'll catch a whole lot of nipple. I strongly suggest that no one see this movie EVER!</3\", \"My flatmate rented out this film the other night, so we watched it together.  The first impression is actually a positive one, because the whole movie is shot in this colorful, grainy, post-MTV texture. Fast sequences, cool angles, sweeping camera moves - for the moment there you feel like you about to watch another \\\"Snatch\\\", for the moment....  When the plot actually starts unfolding, one starts to feel as if one over-dosed amphetamine. things just don't make sense anymore. i would hate to spoil the fun of watching it by giving out certain scenes, but then again, the film is so bad that you are actually better off NOT watching it.  First you think it is a crime story recounted in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. WRONG. This conversation provides no coherent narrative whatsoever. Rather on the contrary, Domino's lesbian come on on Lucy Liu's character during the second part of the movie just throws the audience into further confusion.  Then i thought that maybe it is a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background who grew to be a tough bounty hunter. In any case, that is the message conveyed by the opening scenes. But after that the question of Domino's character is entirely lost to the criminal plot. So in short, NO this is NOT a movie about Domino's character.  Then i thought, it's probably a story of one robbery. A pretty bloody robbery. 10 millions went missing, bounty hunters are chasing around suspected robbers, mafia kids are executed, hands are removed, Domino tries to crack why this time they get no bounty certificates, etc. But soon this impression is dispelled by another U-turn of the plot.  This time we are confronted with a sad story of an obese Afro-American woman, who fakes driver's licenses at the local MVD and at the age of 28 happens to be a youngest grandmother. Lateesha stars on Jerry Springer show, tries to publicize some new, wacky racial theory, and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick granddaughter.  What does this have to do with the main plot? URgh, well, nobody knows. Except that director had to explain the audiences where will bounty hunters put their collectors' fee of 300,000.  Then at some point you start to think: \\\"Oh, it is about our society and the way media distorts things\\\". There is reality TV crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent footage. The bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of Hollywood actors, who just whine all the time about having their noses broken and themselves dragged around too many crime scenes. But NO, this is not a movie about media, they just appear sporadically throughout the movie.  Plus there are numerous other sub-plots: the crazy Afghani guy bent on liberating Afghanistan, the love story between Domino and Chocco, the mescaline episode, the FBI surveillance operation...  Can all of the things mentioned above be packed into 2 hrs movie? Judge for yourself, but my conclusion is clear - it is a veritable mess!\", \"From the first moment, this \\\"thing\\\" is just an awful sequence of extremely short cuts of blurry camera work. While the overall plot has every potential for a thriller, the story is so badly told that I'm unable to buy it. From the middle of the film, the actions of characters don't make sense to me. Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS.  For instance, Ed's idea to have Edna make coffee for them after having shot off her son's arm is way below his alleged experience; it's just an extremely stupid idea. Domino not questioning the fragmentary orders she receives from Claremont Williams over a breaking-up phone connection just eludes me; shouldn't she be long suspicious that Williams is turning them in? Those FBI agents seem out of their minds showing up with just one single helicopter to something they have every reason to consider a capital mafia shoot-out. Besides, what they do by withholding and leaking information towards Cigliutti is pretty much incitement to murder; it seems to me like farewell to justice if that's they way the FBI does investigations. In reality, they'd have a case messed up beyond repair if they acted like this. We get to see a car accident which normally would have at least seriously injured if not killed most of the passengers but miraculously leaves all of them with just a few bruises. Quite the contrary, the accident is immediately followed by Domino making love to Choco, which is from Domino's viewpoint in no way founded by previous events but just by being drugged to the eyeballs.  The whole sequence of scenes starting from the phone call of Claremont Williams appears to me just as want-to-be dramatic razzle-dazzle. This combined with the awful, uneasy camera work just makes a piece I hesitate to call a movie. I'm sorry for the wasted effort of the main actors, whose talent is out of question.\", \"Repetitive music, annoying narration, terrible cinematography effects. Half of the plot seemed centered around shock value and the other half seemed to be focused on appeasing the type of crowd that would nag at people to start a fight.  One of the best scenes was in the \\\"deleted scenes\\\" section, the one where she's in the principle's office with her mom. I don't understand why they'd cut that. The movie seemed desperate to make a point about anything it could and Domino talking about sororities would have been a highlight of the movie.  Ridiculous camera work is reminiscent of MTV, and completely not needed or helpful to a movie. Speeding the film up just to jump past a lot of things and rotating the camera around something repeatedly got old the first time it was used. It's like the directors are wanting to use up all this extra footage they didn't want to throw away.  Another movie with Jerry Springer in it? That should've told me not to watch it from the preview.  A popular movie for the \\\"in\\\" crowd.\", \"Tony Scott destroys anything that may have been interesting in Richard Kelly's clich\\u00e9d, patchy, overwrought screenplay. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model who dropped out and became a bounty hunter. This is her story... \\\"sort of\\\".  The problem with this rubbish is that there isn't much of a story at all and Scott's extreme graphic stylization of every shot acts as a distancing mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in Harvey's chaotic life.  You just don't care about Harvey. Knightley plays her as an obnoxious, cynical brat who has done nothing to warrant our respect. She punches people she doesn't like and sheds her clothes and inhibitions when the situation calls for it, but she isn't the least bit real and Knightly isn't the least bit convincing, either.  The film is boring. It's loud, too, and shackled with one of the most annoying source music scores I've heard in a long time. The final twenty minutes are a poor re-run of Scott's \\\"True Romance\\\" climax with Domino's gang going to meet two sets of feuding bad guys who are -- surprise! surprise! -- destined to shoot it out with each other at the top of a Las Vegas casino.  Unfortunately, this potentially exciting conflagration is totally botched by Scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious, pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation. This is not an artistically brave or experimental piece; it is a failure on every level because it gives us no entry point to the lives and dilemmas of its characters.  Mickey Roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter, but he disappears into the background as the \\\"narrative\\\" progresses. Chris Walken turns in another embarrassing cameo and Dabney Coleman, always solid, is underutilized.  Don't be fooled by this film's multi-layered, gimmick-ridden surface. It is still a turd no matter how hard you polish it.\"], \"review_score\": [7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2], \"review_category\": [\"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 4.2}, \"Do the Right Thing\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0097216\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0329028\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Dune\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0087182\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Ed Wood\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0109707\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Edtv\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0131369\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Election\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0126886\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"L.A.

I thought that this movie would be incredibly boring. Instead, it has become one of my favorites. It portrays life in WWII quite accurately, and the love story is amazing. The love story made the movie so incredible. I felt this interesting feeling, of passion or something. It made me want to watch the movie over and over again. Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes are amazing actors and the way they played their characters is amazing. The look wonderful together and actually seemed to be in love. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie to watch as a leisure activity, or for an assignment.\", \"A wonderful story...so beautiful told..so intense so whit no keyboard to describe I think...,go see it feel it...,it tell's a story about love ,romance ,war,and be trail so wonderful so full of romance if you love romance see it ,if you don't love romance ,drama well skip it that's all I can I vote 10 out of 10 stars wonderful...\", \"I have heard an awful lot about 'The English Patient' and I finally decided to get the CD and find out what all the ballyhoo was about. What I found out was a cinematic delight and should, I repeat 'should' always be watched with an open mind. If you are a religious, moral zealot, I am afraid this is not a film for you as you will fail to see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece as you will keep on harping on the moral dilemmas this film creates. As I remember correctly before I watched this film I read the review in this site and was thoroughly disgusted by the views of that person who I quote said 'that the protagonists thoroughly deserved what they got'. When it comes to morality I agree with him but this is not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence.   I must admit rarely have I seen such a wonderfully crafted film. I keep on hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious. First and foremost this is a love story and yes it's an extramarital affair (moralists beware) but lets not keep focusing on that. Instead let's focus on how the story was told. It's an admixture of flashbacks and the present. Its set in the world war II and tells us the story of a survivor of a plane crash (Count Almazhy played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes) who is looked after by an army nurse (Juliet Binoche) in war torn Italy just before the beginning of the end (defeat of the axis powers). The burn scarred patient very much in pain kept on remembering the torrid affair he had with an English woman Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) shown in flashbacks set in pre-war Africa. The past and the present are interwoven so adroitly in the story that you're sort of transported in the story and get the feel of a first hand viewer. The locales in the desert and in Italy are beautiful and so are the characters. I am a romantic and am not ashamed to say I had tears after it ended. Watch it with someone you truly love. The movie starts and ends with the same shot of the desert where the sand dunes twist and curves like a woman's body and it was breathtaking. The sense of loss and grief was conveyed so overwhelmingly by the actors that it makes me wonder why god! Why do we have wars that destroys beauty and the most unforgivable of all, the destruction of Innocence.   Anyway it deservedly won a bunch of Oscars and I will go hunting for other works of director Anthony Minghella.It kind of brings back the romanticism in the David Lean genre of films.It almost reminds me of 'Lawrence of Arabia' which was also based in the desert.Happy viewing folks.\", \"In a critical scene, as Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) lies in the Cave Of Swimmers, she writes something read aloud by Hana (Juliette Binoche) in which she proclaims that \\\"the light has gone out now, and I'm writing in the darkness...\\\" A sentence of such poetic beauty could not be more perfect for the cinematic brilliance of the far from tiresome The English Patient. With such a dramatic sweep that keeps one firmly on their feet, and a strength about the film that doesn't let up, this film proudly celebrates the mysteries and romances of World War II, taking elements of Casablanca and Lawrence Of Arabia along with some independence in the form of Tuscany.  The English Patient unabashedly pulls the heartstrings and takes us through a mysterious first act, a romantic second act, and a beautiful... beautiful final act, and it isn't just the wonderful pace and setting, it's the performance of Ralph Fiennes, who keeps us sympathetic even when Count Alm\\u00e1sy, from the very start, proves to be a thoroughly unlikable character. Usually typecast as a villain, he shows tainted, but ultimately human colours as a man taken in by a desperate love that he must fulfill.  Many will criticize this film based on its so called \\\"glorification of adulterers\\\", but those who do know nothing. The contrasts between the two periods (before and after the plane crash seen at the start) are spectacular, as the patient is the regretting man who suffers because of what he did, the evil that was once in him now absent, whereas the man of before the crash is an individual like anyone else. He wants this woman but he cannot have her, Fiennes brings the human-like qualities out of Alm\\u00e1sy in a way absolutely NO OTHER actor could. There couldn't have been a better actor for the job.  So please, take these comments to heart, see the film, those who call it \\\"boring\\\" or \\\"despicable\\\" know nothing, and should be ashamed of such a one-dimensional view on the film, a view that they have neither studied nor corrected, and probably don't plan on correcting. The English Patient is the best of every film to have ever won the Best Picture Oscar, and for so many reasons, hidden in their poetic triumphs.\", \"From 1996, first i watched this movie, i feel never reach the end of my satisfaction, i feel that i want to watch more and more until now, my god i don't believe it was ten years ago, and i can believe that i almost remember every word of the dialogues. I love this movie and i love this novel, absolutely perfection. i love Willem Defoe, he has a strange voice to spell the words \\\"black night\\\" and i always say it for many times, never being bored. I love the music of Szararem, it's so much spiritualistic, made me come into another world deep in my heart. anyone can feel what i feel and anyone could make the movie like this? i don't believe so. Thanks Ondaatje thanks Mingela.\", \"The English Patient is one of those films that mostly deserve all the highest praise. I say, most, because this movie, albeit very serious, intense, deep and really thoughtful, still suffers some drawbacks. First and foremost, why, oh why are the modern films so long? This one lasts for more than two hours and from time to time it becomes really hard to concentrate and follow the extremely serious plot. I say, if the film were an hour shorter, that would serve it only good. However, we have what we have. The winner of several Oscars, The English Patient is still very good. It is a deep, insightful treatise of human soul, love and betrayal, war and cowardice, violence and bravery. Ralph Fiennes is a smashing superb actor. His hero, neurotic and silent, is an enigmatic person, ready for everything only to save the life of his lover. He is great, even though half the time he is a deformed cripple. He is the strongest link here. Juliette Binoche is as usual very convincing and sweet. She adds a lot with her excellent play and the love story plot with that Sikh officer. Willem Defoe, Colin Firth, Christine Scott Thomas are all here, all enormous and all very strong. And then there is desert of Egypt, then there is deep, cloudless sky, green groves of Italy. The nature is here, even when people die, bombs roar, land mines explode. War is here, too. It is obvious, terrible, and bloody. Then, there are corpses, horrible gory bodies, then nude bodies, adultery and all. I do not know what to say. So much of a splendid actors' work, so much of realism, so much of brutality that war brings. This is not a film for relaxation. It makes you think.\", \"Even after all these years, this remain \\\"a perfect movie\\\" for me. I still remember sitting for a long time in the theater after it was over, stunned by the experience, overcome by emotion. I own the DVD (of course!) is see at least once a year. It's incomparable and I cannot add much to has already been written about its excellence and beauty. So glad others love it as much as I do! A note: the author of the book on which it's based - Michael Ondatje - was enchanted with the film and is quoted as saying he wished he had thought of some of the lovely scenes written purely for the movie...the way Kip \\\"invites\\\" Hana to his side with a trail of small candles, and the way he arranges for Hana to view the frescoes in the ruined medieval church.\", \"Was curious to know the name of the Tuscan village where the filming in Italy was done. I know the villa's name: Villa San Girolamo, however, would like to know the exact location in Tuscany. The cinematography is excellent and it would be wonderful to visit that area. I would also be interested to know what the location of the desert shooting is as well. Travel extensively in Europe and Africa and would am interested in visiting the areas that the book and film were about. Please e-mail me with any information on the sites that any one might have. We would be very grateful. And if any one knows if the villa in Tuscany is still habitable, that would be awesome as well. I await any information and I thank you in advance for your time.\", \"There have been several comments already on the site focusing on the \\\"prestige\\\" feel of the film - and there is a lot of heavy-weight talent on show: from Fiennes and Scott-Thomas to the magnificently rendered design and scoring, to the masterly direction. No wonder that Andrew Lloyd Webber's acceptance speech for \\\"Evita\\\" at that year's Oscars began \\\"Well, thank God that \\\"The English Patient\\\" had no songs in it.\\\" Writing of Oscar winners takes me to Juliette Binoche, who, in a stellar cast, gives a beautiful performance. It is heartening to see that the dynamics which seem to influence the award for Best Actor (often going to showy pyrotechnic display) aren't at work in the female categories. Just as Emma Thompson's hugely well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel in \\\"Howard's End\\\" proved that one of the hardest things that an actor can do is make the portrayal of \\\"goodness\\\" involving, so Binoche's win proved that it could be that - and seriously sexy. Her performance in this terrific film is a thing of beauty.\", \"In World War II, a badly burned amnesiac known only as \\\"The English Patient\\\" is found in the African desert and is transported to Italy, where he joins a convoy of medical troops and others at an abandoned monastery. Among them are Hana (Juliette Binoche), a Canadian nurse whose lovers generally meet unpleasant ends; Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Hardy (Kevin Whately), two explosives experts who search the monastery for bombs; and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), a Canadian soldier-of-fortune who knows the identity of the English patient and has a score to settle.  Through flashbacks we learn the story of the Patient: he is Laszo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian explorer who, in the late '30s, falls in with a group of British cartographers, including Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and his wife Katharine (Kristen Scott-Thomas), while mapping the deserts of North Africa. After Clifton leaves them on government business, Katharine and Clifton fall in love with each other in the desert, resulting in an affair that, naturally, has a less-than-happy ending.  If one is able to overlook the illogical parts of the story line (such as, why would a patient found in Africa be sent to what is essentially the front line of the war in Italy?), then you can appreciate \\\"The English Patient\\\" as a throwback to the intelligent, layered, sweeping epics of David Lean in the '60s. Much more than \\\"Titanic\\\" or other epic romances of late, this movie puts one in mind of \\\"Doctor Zhivago\\\" and \\\"Gone With the Wind\\\" - an epic love story set against a huge historical backdrop. You shouldn't expect a war film, though there are some striking (if all-too-brief) scenes of violence that stand out more than the romantic sections, as is usually the case (Caravaggio's interrogation by a sadistic SS officer (Jurgen Prochnow) in particular).  The movie is very ambiguous, in regards to pretty much everything. The central question of the film is: How far are you willing to go for love? As critics of the movie are fast to point out, Almasy is, on the surface, a far-from-likable character - he has an affair with a married woman and betrays his country by giving maps and intelligence to the Germans, causing the death of his friend Madox (Julian Wadham) and the torture of Caravaggio, and actually killing a British soldier who has him under arrest at one point. The fact that Almasy is in many ways reprehensible is kind of the point - he's in love with Katharine, and sees the world narrowly in terms of his love that loyalty to country (or anything else for that matter) is secondary; as Almasy says, he hates \\\"Ownership. Being owned.\\\" The two engage in a rather bold love affair (shagging within ear shot of hundreds of people at a Christmas party) and it's clear that Katharine is more drawn to the mysterious, exciting Almasy than the comparatively boring Geoffrey.  The 1944 subplot is somewhat shaky and seems superfluous; the romance between Kip and Hannah is never completely believable, and I feel the film could have done without it. But those sequences do add an interesting texture of mystery and complexity to the film, so I won't complain too much.  Like the epics mentioned above, the film is able to convey time and place through simple devices like crowd scenes, strategically placed posters, and military presence. We do not need to dwell on the fact that it's 1938 in Cairo, but it's helpful to know. The direction of Anthony Minghella and the desert cinematography by John Seale are absolutely gorgeous; the sand dunes, sand storms, and haunting caves of the desert are captured in beautiful detail. Gabriel Yared's score is haunting and atmospheric.  The acting is generally solid. Fiennes gives a very layered performance as a character who is mysterious, complex, and haunted. The difference between the Almasys of 1938 and 1944 are remarkable; one exciting and somewhat carefree, the other haunted and reflective. Kirsten Scott Thomas is effective as Katharine, the female explorer looking for adventure, and Colin Firth gives one of his best performances as Geoffrey, who realizes early on that he's no competition for the exciting Almasy. Willem Dafoe does nice work as Caravaggio, the shifty, hunted thief-turned-spy driven by revenge. Jurgen Prochnow gives a performance reminiscent of Jose Ferrer in \\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\\" (and a similar character too): very brief, but more memorable then some of the major characters. Some of the 1944 actors are unremarkable: Juliette Binochette is nothing special, while Naveen Andrews is good but unremarkable. Kevin Whately, as Kip's ill-fated partner, does what he can with a rather smallish role.  \\\"The English Patient\\\" is not a perfect movie by any means, but the vituperative attacks on it by much of the movie-going public are not deserved at all. Maybe it's a show of how film sensibilities have changed since the era of the Leans and Kubricks, or maybe people were expecting something simple to understand. Complex to fault, brilliantly directed and shot, \\\"The English Patient\\\" is a wonderful modern-day epic.  8/10\", \"The book is better than the film mostly because of the writer Ondatje's prose. Before I saw this film, someone who had seen it, told me the love depicted in this film isn't real. After seeing this film, I can see how her suspension of disbelief in this regard could've been distracting to other movie-goers as well. Frankly, some of the intense displays of love were laughable and seem to be on the edge of parody. But by the end, everyone should realize this is a big message piece of art. It is not specifically about love at all, it uses \\\"love\\\" to dialectically reveal the human divide or the arbitrary borders of countries that help justify wars and hatred. It is about misunderstandings and the blind following of the things that supposedly separate us. The critical scene for the real theme of this movie is when the hero or antihero's pleas for help for his stranded lover in the desert is ignored and disregarded for the reasons shown in that scene. This film is also about hope and forgiveness, the hope epitomized in the interracial relationship between Binoche's recovering character and the Indian minesweeper (echoed in the Sikh's buddy-buddy relationship with his white coworker who ends up dying nonsensically) and the forgiveness epitomized in the Caravaggio character's first hunt and then forcing out of what he thinks will be the hero's confessions for his war \\\"crimes\\\" (betrayal of country). I think the film could've been made even better than it is. I don't know if a more realistic portrayal of the circumstances of love would've made the real themes and points of this film even more obvious or not, but I agree this film is not about realistic romantic love, as the people behind this piece of art or film imply in an early scene when the eventual lovers first meet. The hero talks about how a new car, broken-down car, fast car, etc. (I'm paraphrasing) is still just a car no matter what adjective you put in front of it. She replies but parental love, platonic love, romantic love, etc. are very different kinds of love. This is ironic because this film is really about the one love all humans should want which is the love of (or for) peace (not materialistic things which are usually the real reasons for wars, epitomized in something most of us want such as \\\"cars\\\", let's say). Otherwise, we may be left stranded to die in a cave in a vast desert with ancient wall art/drawings of swimmers, suggesting that the seas and life-supporting waters which were once there have all but disappeared. I believe \\\"The English Patient\\\" won the Oscar because of these big messages not specifically for its depiction of romantic love. Awards tend to go that way. The relationship of the hero and heroine was necessary to draw the audience in, unfortunately this view of love may be antiquated in the age of divorce and so many singles who can't seem to get together on so many levels, so ridiculous versions of mythic love are hard to get into, even in daydreams, which film love has always been, especially in good old Hollywood. The film may fall short of what people expect but a 7 out of 10 movie worth seeing, regardless.\", \"I can never figure if this is the Artiest Soap Opera ever produced, or the Soapiest Art Movie. No matter, John Seale's cinematogaphy is utterly ravishing. Ondaatje's novel is not reduced, but for once, elevated to film. If there is a fault, it is in the original novel, not in Anthony Minghella's beautiful movie. Anyone who has a problem with it's length almost certainly has not read the book, and probably cannot read. I do not like repeating adjectives, but ravishing serves the purpose.   Apart from the storyline, the players excel. But it is the Australian sense of light and shade that ultimately triumphs. Like some antipodean Dutch Master, Seale uses a blast of light, where Van Rijn would have used shade. One could weep for cinematography this magnificent.\", \"A sweeping and deeply moving love story featuring powerful performances from Ralph Fiennes,Willem Defoe and Juliette Binoche.  It tells the story of a badly burned man(Ralph Fiennes) who gets pulled out of a plane wreak during World War Two and tells his nurse(Juliette Binoche)his story.  Just before the war he fell in love with the beautiful Katherine Clifton(Kristen Scott Thomas)however she is married to Jeffery Clifton(Colin Firth)and the two begin a passionate and forbidden affair.  A very haunting and tragic story of love and desire set against some absolutely gorgeous locations in the desert.A must see especially if your a fan of Anthony Minghellas work but be prepared to shed a lot of tears its very moving especially at the end.\", \"One of the most charming and, for me at least, the most powerful elements of Anthony Minghella's enthralling Best Picture-winner \\\"The English Patient\\\" is that, in the mid 90s, when Hollywood was in the initial stage of having lost its nerve for grand new projects, a film was created that brought back traces\\u0097very powerful traces\\u0097of the sweeping, wonderful majesty that crafted movies such as \\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\\" (1962) and \\\"The Ten Commandments\\\" (1956). \\\"The English Patient\\\" contains very much of what made those films so powerful. It has that glorious feeling, a stretched running time that hardly seems long at all, and fascinating characters with pasts and stories.  \\\"The English Patient\\\", based on a novel by the same name by Michael Ondaatje, is like \\\"The Godfather: Part II\\\" (1974) in the sense of how it's constructed. It's a blending of two stories: the past and the present and it all revolves around the titular character: an English patient in the post years of World War Two. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, who has been scarred for life by a plane crash, and being taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse played marvelously by Juliette Binoche. Apart from bonding with her raspy-voiced, troubled patient, Binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger (Willem Dafoe) arrives and the two men appear to know each other.  That's just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film. The other one, told in flashback, is the patient's past, before he was scarred and dying in a bed. The story of the present mixed with the patient's past and his love affair that tragically changed his life forever.  To be blunt, \\\"The English Patient\\\" is a love story blended with a sweeping epic sensation and it blends magnificently. What I really admired about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how passionate, how obsessive, how enchanting it was shown on screen. Usually in love stories, such as Minghella's later \\\"Cold Mountain\\\" (2003), the romantic elements seem far more lustful than obsessive to me. Some of the love scenes feature elements that may tend to be associated more with lust than love, but still, because it is so well developed and not rushed and not exploited out of proportion, we can believe that there is a sure, true love between these characters. It reminded me a lot of \\\"Vertigo\\\" (1958) in how well the filmmakers and performers convinced us that these were two actual human beings who truly fell in love with each other.  Performances all around were great. I was especially enthralled by the performance by Juliette Binoche, who took home the Oscar for her performance the following year. I also liked Willem Dafoe playing the sort of cynical, questionable character that he's always quintessential at playing. And of course I can't leave out Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their portrayals of two very passionate lovers.  Despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest if I were to describe it as a perfect film. There are two flaws that I cannot glance over. Number one, it is a little too long and the reason for this is my second complaint, there are a few unnecessary subplots. I was not enchanted or particularly interested with the second love story between Binoche and a bomb specialist played by Naveen Andrews. My research has led me to assume that this plot element comes from the original book and I'm sure it worked perfectly in there, but in the film, it just seems a little\\u0085distracting and the relationship between the two characters didn't fascinate me. I was far more interested by Fiennes character and his relationships with his two leading actresses.  Nevertheless, these two flaws are easily forgivable even if they do slow things down a bit. Those put aside, \\\"The English Patient\\\" is an extraordinary achievement of film-making. To me, it was sort of like an insane mix up between \\\"Casablanca\\\" (1942) and \\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\\" (1962), two remarkable and better films, and this effective blend proved to be well worth my time. It is a real shame that Anthony Minghella has left us. For he was a truly gifted filmmaker. This is all the evidence anybody needs.\", \"I watched this movie when it was released and being really young and not too much into cinema it was one of the most fascinating cinematic experiences I ever had and it really left a mark inside me.At first I didn't quite understand the story and probably failed to make the necessary correlations between past and present as the movie presents them to the viewer.  Years after I first watched I managed to watch it again and this was the time that I fell in love with 'The English Patient', it touched me so deeply and for me it became the best film ever made.  Anthony Minghella made an absolutely stunning film, all the locations are amazing and through his camera he manages to create unbelievable emotions inside you.  Of course, the music of the film is such a big part of the whole emotional journey of the characters and the film would not be the same without it.  But personally the best thing was the fragile performance that Ralph Fiennes gave in this masterpiece. He plays so well the man that falls in love slowly but so deeply with Katherine Clifton,opens up his heart and dives into this prohibited affair.  The most heart-breaking scene for me will always be the one where hurt Katherine is carried by Almasy towards the Cave of Swimmers and she wears the thimble that he bought her.She says 'I always wore it.I always loved you' and at that moment he starts crying with such pain flowing from inside him.  Juliette Binoche is also amazing in her performance and really deserved the Oscar she won.  Overall, this is a film that anybody who proclaims himself a cinema lover should watch in their lives.\", \"I won't go to a generalization, and say it's the best love story of all time, as some have said. That's fine, people feel very deeply about this film, you either love it I believe...or you simply hate it. I don't want to say, the best of all,because that is simply too 'broad' for me to make a statement like that. However, I feel very passionately about The English Patient, as well as millions of other people do.   The awards say it all.   I don't agree with critics, on many levels, however, the ones that picked this one, I couldn't agree more.  9-Oscars.   41-wins.  37-other nominations, makes this love story,on the top of the bunch.   From the director, Anthony Minghella, the story that bursts onto the screen and as Mr. Peterman (from T.V.s Seinfeld) said, \\\"Elaine, I simply can't take my eyes off of it!\\\" In this instance, I don't agree with Elaine's response. But the story builds and takes the right time, needed to make it's case beautifully. The cinematography,(John Seale) won multiple awards as well, as it ought too. I have not really paid much attention to Juliette Binoche, until now. Well, not entirely true I loved her performance in \\\"Sabrina\\\" Lovely story of a somewhat complicated relationship, next to Harrison Ford. But this was simply an incredibly differing character for her, and as deeply talented as she is, she simply shined in her own subtle and graceful way, she was just what this film was looking for, I'm truly glad that it was her performance and not another actress. Ralph Fiennes, was also spectacular in portraying Count Laszlo De Almasy. I had a new respect for his ability, after seeing this one! What can you say except, see this picture again. (*****)\", \"Anthony Minghella's 'The English Patient' is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. It is grand and impressive in scale, and yet so heartbreakingly intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering. At the 1997 Academy Awards, the film owned the night, taking home nine awards from twelve nominations, the most decisive cleansweep since Bernardo Bertolucci's 'The Last Emperor' in 1988. Based on Canadian author Michael Ondaatje's 1992 Booker Prize-winning novel of the same name, 'The English Patient' is a touching meditation on life, love and loss, tracing the history of a critically-burnt man in the aftermath of World War Two.  During the war, a man (Ralph Fiennes) is discovered in the burning remnants of a crashed plane. With his face scarred beyond recognition, and with the man seemingly suffering from amnesia, he is assumed to be an Allied soldier, and is simply referred to as \\\"the English patient.\\\" After the war, in the mine-ridden hills of Italy, a kind nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), who has apparently lost everybody close to her, remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying man. Over time, she comes to learn more and more about her \\\"English patient,\\\" who is actually revealed to be a Hungarian geographer, Count Laszlo de Alm\\u00e1sy. Rather than losing his memory in the plane crash, we learn that this scar-ridden man has perhaps chosen to forget his past, both to protect himself from persecution and to cure himself of the tragic memories of his past love. Via numerous flashbacks, we learn of Alm\\u00e1sy's former exploits in the Sahara desert, and his romantic liaison with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas).  It's certainly easy to see why 'The English Patient' was so successful at the Oscars. It is such a beautiful film, blending the quiet beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. Cinematographer John Seale captures the landscape to perfection; not since David Lean's magnificent 'Lawrence of Arabia' has a film shown the desert with such beauty and grandeur, making particularly good use of sweeping aerial shots from Alm\\u00e1sy's plane. Even in the film's more intimate moments, excellent use of close-ups and lighting capture the emotion of the scene, coupled, of course, with the brilliant performances from all the cast members.  A long-time favourite actor of mine, 'The English Patient' might just contain Ralph Fiennes' finest performance, and, considering his history includes such films as 'Schindler's List' and 'The Constant Gardener,' this is not a complement that is to be taken lightly. His Count Laszlo de Alm\\u00e1sy is initially a very sympathetic character, but, as we slowly learn more about his past, his likable qualities are eroded by his less-admirable tendencies towards others. \\\"Ownership\\\" is a major theme of the film. When asked by Katherine what he hates most, Alm\\u00e1sy replies with \\\"Ownership. Being owned. When you leave you should forget me.\\\" However, as the relationship progresses, and Katherine perhaps tries to distance herself from him, Alm\\u00e1sy reveals a hint of arrogance, insisting that his love for her somehow entitles him to have her whenever he likes: \\\"I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine, which belong to me.\\\"  Juliette Binoche, who received an Oscar for her performance here, is excellent as Hana, the lonesome nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies that have always harmed those close to her. After some time of caring for Alm\\u00e1sy alone, she is joined by a dubious Canadian thief, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who lost his thumbs during the war, and who suspects that it was Alm\\u00e1sy who betrayed him to the Germans. Hana also strikes up a tentative romantic relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian bomb-diffuser in the British Army. However, due to her past history, Hana is afraid that becoming involved with Kip will doom him to death, particularly considering his very dangerous line of work.  At 160 minutes in length, 'The English Patient' wonderfully evokes memories of the classic romantic epics of old, successfully finding a balance of mystery, love, joy and tragedy. The ending of the film is heartbreaking and sorrowful, but also uplifting in its own way. Whilst some romantic relationships are doomed from the very beginning, others have a very good chance of bringing happiness. Nevertheless, in every case, it is always better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.\", \"It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \\\"The English Patient\\\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \\\"The Talented Mr Ripley\\\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \\\"Breaking And Entering\\\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \\\"The English Patient\\\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \\\"Minghellian\\\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.\", \"'The English Patient' can rightly be compared to the films of David Lean, whose sweeping epics such as 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Bridge on the River Kwai' must have inspired the director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed, and like 'Lawrence', is set in Northern Africa, but during the second world war. The story is complex, but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas.   The story, based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje, is told in flashbacks by Fiennes' Count Laszlo de Almasy - the titular character. The fact that his name does not sound like he's English plays a key role in what unfolds. He has been badly burned in a plane crash, occurring just as the film opens, and is being cared for back in Europe by Hana, an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche. What makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time, and the development of characters beyond that of the two ill-fated lovers. The film makes clear that true love and passion, even with dreaded consequences, can make life worth living, or worth dying for. If you're a romantic at heart, and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes, you may find that 'The English Patient' speaks directly to you.  \", \"Count Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) has just been transferred to a hospital in Italy during World War II. He is horrifically burned from an ambush. His nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) tends to him, body and mind, for she fears, quite rightly, that he may be a very troubled soul. In the course of his care, the Count starts to tell Hana of his recent past. It seems he worked in a government capacity in Africa, where he met a beautiful married lady named Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. After a brief affair, Katherine called it quits, leaving the Count desolate. Even so, the two would meet again, under heart-wrenching circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana herself falls for a Sihk man in the British bomb squad. Yet, the war is raging relentlessly. Can love exist when the world is in turmoil? This is a tremendous film, based on an equally fine but complex novel. The plot has many story lines that are woven together beautifully, each of them poignant beyond description. The script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Fiennes is magnificent, both as the burn victim and as the man who thought love was a myth. Scott Thomas is also quite fine as the woman who fights against her passions. As for Binoche, she richly deserved the Oscar that she was presented, as her nurse is a shining example of hope in a hopeless situation. The scenery is utterly gorgeous, as are the costumes, the direction, and the production. If you have missed out on viewing this film, rectify that soon, very soon. The English Patient will remain one of the greatest achievements in film for centuries to come.\", \"TEP is like a long cool drink of water after crawling across the Sahara to classic film buffs who have been too long deprived of that certain cinematic magic! Not only is it beautifully photographed, but the characters are perfectly portrayed. If you're looking for the film to be a mirror of the book, you will be seriously disappointed. Instead, it is an excellent \\\"companion\\\" to the book, and I think that is what Anthony Minghella intended. Ralph Fiennes is probably the most beautiful man in the world; not to mention a brilliant actor. Juliette Binoche is the posterchild for vulnerability and childlike enthusiasm. And, of course, I'll go see any film in which Kristin Scott Thomas is featured. She simply must be THE best actress since the likes of Deborah Kerr. So much was promised with this film, and so much is delivered!\", \"I like this movie above all others. It is \\\"multi-layered\\\"; there is so much to see and appreciate. Every viewing brings a new appreciation of the story-line, the plot and the characters. Faultlessly acted and extremely enjoyable if you take the time to watch it and appreciate it. I love the interaction between the players; the subtle relationships; the period atmosphere. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly cast as the brooding lover and Geoffrey the wronged husband is beautifully underplayed by Colin Firth. The scene in the sand storm where Catherine & El-masy are discussing the different types of sand storms is one of the high-lights of the film and where the affair really starts. The other relationship between Hanna & El-masy is yet another \\\"layer\\\" of the movie which is totally enchanting (and heart-rending). A worthy winner of so many awards.\", \"as can be read in many reviews here it is a movie you love or hate - apparently not so much space for opinions in between. I for one think that is a good sign.   I always appreciated this movie, although the genre is not my typical style (I never watched Titanic for instance, and am not planning to).  The English Patient grips because it shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment as opposed when they are 'home' (Katherine), it shows how destructive love can be in a slow, strong and utterly painful way, it excites because of the extremely passionate affair, the pain of the one(s) who leave behind, how pointless one can feel to move on.   The photography is just stunning, not to mention the play of the actors. The pace is slow, but timely, and that does justice to the book, the timeline, and the depth/development of the characters. To put this in 110 minutes (as some seem to suggest here) would amputate the multi-layeredness of this movie. People tend to have difficulties with the pace of movies... as if they are in a rush to get to work.. hey - get a life ! ;-) enjoy...  I give this movie 4.5 out of 5.\", \"I've seen a few movies in my time, but this one is exceptional. You'll have to watch it more than once to truly appreciate it, it is emotionally very complex, it explores love and passion at it's most extreme and it's cinematography is just breathtaking. The character of the Count is intensely passionate and tragic without him having to raise his voice or indeed leave his bed, the film is perfectly cast and perfectly acted. The film has a sort of mathematical precision and perfection to it which is rare these days. It combines action, love, tragedy, drama and politics all in one. This movie is unmissable, all the hype surrounding it and all the awards cannot begin to do it any justice. Hats off to Michael Ondaatje for writing the incredible book on which it is based.\", \"'The English Patient' is a love story set in Europe as World War II ends... It is a wartime romance mystery epic, like 'Hiroshima, Mon Amour,' 'The Sweet Hereafter,' and 'After Life.' Anthony Minghella weaves extravagant beauty around a central character whose condition is grotesque, and puts emotional barriers between the characters and the audience...  This adult love story is an intimate portrait in the tradition of 'Casablanca' and 'Dr. Zhivago.' The film sweeps gracefully attaining a level of eroticism and emotional connection that many similar films had missed... Told in flashback, it is a masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse...  Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, Count Laszlo de Almasy, a Hungarian cartographer of few words, who works for the British government, and is stationed in the North African desert...  Count Laszlo is the unidentified survivor of a plane crash turned over to the Allies, taken into custody by a medical convoy in Italy, and essentially left to die in peace, in an isolated monastery in Tuscany, under the care of an inspiring pretty nurse who injects him with morphine, and reads to him a book, considered his great treasure, and his one surviving possession...  Hana seeks to stimulate his touching memories, wrapped up in his head, released in lost pieces from his disturbed mind...  Fiennes gives a haunted, pained performance, playing the young man whose veneer of charm cannot plainly cover his heart's capacity for passion... He makes us sympathize with the character in showing self-doubt and weakness... As a badly burned man, he has only cherished memories... His joy and heartbreak are completely clear and visible in his eyes... He remembers falling under the spell of an attractive English married woman... He remembers the way this turns him from a harsh abrupt wanderer into a man willing to betray everything for love... His tragic love affair forms the heart of the motion picture...  Kristin Scott Thomas matches Fiennes' work with a radiant sensuality... She is captivating as the married European woman, conveying the audience with the energy and enthusiasm for life that the Count finds irresistible... Their different world, despairing and hopeful, menacing and resilient, is simply beautiful... With intense passion and intelligence, this attractive blonde burns the screen as the different wife...  Juliette Binoche seems to shine as the French-Canadian nurse full of life and energy... This vibrant young woman has a heart of gold, kissing wounded soldiers, but she thinks that she is a curse as anybody she ever loved tends to die on her...  Colin Firth is good as Katherine's husband... He is a British spy flying into the tough desert in a yellow biplane to take aerial maps of the whole North African continent... He quickly becomes friend of the Count, yet when he realizes that his wife has committed adultery, his face reflected a peaceful fury...  William Dafoe plays a double-agent spy who covers his anger with a strange charm... He is a crippled war veteran who has a hidden agenda...

It's a film which purports that one does not choose love, but rather that it's love that does the choosing, regardless of who, where or when; and furthermore, that it's a matter of the heart often contingent upon prevailing conditions and circumstances. And thus is the situation in `The English Patient,' directed by Anthony Minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inopportune of places and times, proving that when it is predestined, love will find a way.  It's WWII; flying above the African desert, Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) is shot down, his biplane mistaken for an enemy aircraft. And though he survives the crash, he is severely burned. To his great good fortune, however, he is rescued by a tribe of nomads and winds up in a hospital. But existing conditions are governed by circumstances of war, and Almasy soon becomes one of many patients being transported via convoy to a different facility. Upon reaching Italy, he is too weak and ill to continue on, and a Canadian nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), volunteers to stay behind with him at an abandoned monastery.  Hana soon discovers that her charge is something of a man of mystery, as Almasy remembers nothing of his past, and not even his own name. Thought to be English, the only clues pointing to who he is are contained in a book found in his possession after the crash, but even they are as cryptic as Hana's patient. Slowly, however, under prompting from Hana, Almasy begins to remember bits and pieces of his life, and his story begins to unfold. And his memory is helped along even more by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who suspects that Almasy is the man he's been looking for-- a man with whom he wants to settle a score. But, burned beyond recognition, Almasy may or may not be that man. Meanwhile, Almasy's memories continue to surface; memories of a woman he loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas)-- as well as memories of Katherine's husband, Geoffrey (Colin Firth). And, crippled in mind and body as he is, those memories become the only thing left to which he can cling with any hope at all, even as his life seems to be slipping farther away with each passing moment.  In addition to directing, Anthony Minghella also wrote the screenplay for this film, which he adapted from the novel by Michael Ondaatje. The result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of Lean's `Doctor Zhivago' and `Lawrence of Arabia'; a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty. Simply put, Minghella's film is genius realized; crafted and delivered with a poetic perfection, watching it is like watching a Monet come to life. From the opening frames, Minghella casts a hypnotic spell over his audience that is binding and transporting, with a story that has an emotional beauty that equals the engagingly stunning and vibrant images brought to life by John Seale's remarkable cinematography; images that virtually fill the screen as well as the soul of the viewer. In every sense, this is a film of rare eloquence, with a striking emotional capacity that facilitates an experience that is truly transcendental. Nominated in twelve categories, it deservedly received a total of nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Binoche) and Cinematography.  If one had to choose a single word to describe the `essence' of this film, it would be `excellence.' Even an extraordinary film, however, does not receive nine Oscars without performances that are extraordinary in kind; and the performances given by Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas here transcend the term `Oscar worthy.' Nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Almasy (Geoffrey Rush was awarded the gold for `Shine'), Fiennes has never been better, achieving an emotional depth with his character that is nearly palpable. Private and introspective, Almasy is not by his very nature an individual to whom the audience will be able to form an intimate connection; Fiennes, however, finds a way to open that emotional door just enough to let you in, enough so that you taste the honest passion welling up within him. And it works. Almasy does not seek your friendship; he will, however, gain your compassion.  Kristen Scott Thomas, too, received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (Frances McDormand received the award for `Fargo') for her portrayal of Katherine, a woman whose stoic countenance masks the emotional conflict raging within her, born of the forbidden passion that enslaves her and yet to which she gives herself willingly, casting off her shackles of repression to embrace a love so strong it threatens to consume her. The reserve Katherine must maintain evokes the empathy of the audience, as Scott Thomas successfully mines the emotional depths of her character to the greatest possible effect. It's the kind of performance that draws you in and holds you fast, taking you as it does beyond that curtain of hypocrisy that dictates what must be if only for the sake of appearances, and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion. Understated and shaded with subtlety, it's terrific work by Kristin Scott Thomas.  Binoche gives a stunning, affecting performance, as well, as the kindhearted nurse, Hana; it is her humanity, in fact, which defines love in it's purest sense and offers a balanced perspective of it within the context of the film. Her relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) affords us a glimpse of passion of another kind, which contrasts effectively with the intensity of that between Almasy and Katherine. `The English Patient' is a film that will move you and fill you emotionally; one you will not want to see end. 10/10.         \", \"OK, what was this story about again? I am afraid that I never read the book and frankly, this was one of the most confusing movies that I have ever tried to watch in a long time. I get a bit confused on the number of flashbacks between the nurse, the patient and the man with no thumbs. The film didn't even really explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it; or even how in the world they all knew each other to come together.  After recently seeing the \\\"Pride and Prejudice\\\" movie with Colin Firth, I have been trying to do a study on his film career by watching other movies of his, and bluntly, other than \\\"What a Girl Wants\\\" I am not finding much where he played in that was any good. I am definitely not saying that HE wasn't good. He is really one of the best actors I have seen in the modern day film, but the content and quality of the films he plays in have a lot to be desired.  \\\"The English Patient\\\" is another perfect example of where the director, writer, and crew are just too close to their subject matter to see that the viewer is not getting the picture \\u0096 literally. The entire movie seemed to be to showcase Ralph Fiennes as a dramatic actor with long periods of emoting that was a bore. Nothing is really explained and every one of the subjects from the beginning seems to need a psychoanalyst evaluation!   Kristin Scott Thomas' character seems to enjoy describing erotic stories standing in front of a totally male audience and titillating other men other than her husband; Colin Firth, who plays her husband, does not necessarily have all his marbles in place and is supposed to be a secret agent \\u0096 I guess; and Ralph Fiennes walks around like a Roman Mr. Darcy (sorry, Colin!) who thinks he knows it all. The rest of the cast is cast (pun intended) to the four winds as the plot wanders on.  The subplot of the mental stability of the nurse (Juliette Binoche) and her motives and involvement with Naveen Andrews is another confusing element that leaves the viewer with an unsavory taste. But of course, the viewer is still reeling how in the world the first two characters (Thomas and Fiennes) ended up having sex the first time anyway. What was the attraction? There was no chemistry and no build-up. Just a slap, bam, thank you!   And isn't it romantic that Fiennes ended up a traitor helping the Germans by giving them maps to the desert? (sarcasm)   To describe this movie, I would have to simply say, \\\"How to impress your gynecologist with your mammograms and cheat on your sweet, adorable husband who loves you.\\\"   The final unbelievable section of this plot is to fathom how anyone would choose Ralph Fiennes over Colin Firth. Firth had very little opportunity to demonstrate any of his acting talents \\u0096 in fact, when watching the movie, I thought it must have been one of his first. The scene where he had been waiting for his wife all night was perhaps the only two second clip that is worth seeing in the movie. At that, I have no interest in watching it again.  The best scene I liked was the plane crash where Firth is trying to take them all out. Too bad he missed! It would have saved an extra twenty minutes of even more fruitless film. Aerial desert scenes were pretty neat, though.\", \"I am not surprised to find user comments for this film full of gushy nonsense, such as that this film \\\"[proves] that when it is predestined, love will find a way.\\\" I begin in this way, not to criticize a specific reviewer, but because this citation so typifies the hyperbolic, uncritical treacle that was poured out over this film, even before it hit the theaters. Even the best of films do not \\\"prove\\\" anything, nor are they intended to. The best films entertain and move the viewer, and \\\"The English Patient\\\" fails on both criteria.  I remember the studio's promotion of \\\"The English Patient\\\" very clearly: \\\"From the producers of 'Amadeus' and 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'\\\" it grandly announced. An ignorant or careless listener might miss the crucial word, \\\"producers,\\\" in this disingenuous statement and mistakenly associate the director of \\\"The English Patient,\\\" so very inappropriately, with the truly great director, Milos Forman. Such a comparison is offensive to the memory of Mr. Forman.  While the novel by Michael Ondaatje upon which the film was based, is a good one, it is unfortunate that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way whatsoever. Aside from plot elements that seem only coincidentally similar, the film bears little resemblance to the novel.  Despite misgivings which began when I heard that shamelessly misleading promotion, I went to see this film in the theater. As it began to unfold, I realized that the rendering of the novel's peculiar magic had failed, that the actors knew their words but not their characters, and that their characters were flat, dull, and unengaging. The film was a complete travesty of Ondaatje's novel and a completely still-born cinematic artifact of the worst description.  Those who gush over this film are very apt to speak with adjectives like, \\\"sweeping,\\\" and \\\"grand,\\\" and \\\"hypnotic.\\\" Well, it is none of those. In fact, not even Ondaatje's fine novel could be described as \\\"sweeping\\\" or \\\"grand.\\\" It could be described as \\\"magical\\\" and \\\"hypnotic\\\" -- yet these are precisely the qualities that the film so utterly failed to deliver. It is almost as if Minghella had, as a reader, entirely missed what was valuable in the novel and could grind out on celluloid only a pale, skeletal version, a version that not only missed the spirit of the story, but that focused on the wrong characters. He produced a filmic transliteration that not only had no respect for story's metaphors but no apparent cognizance of them, as well.  Minghella took the central focus away from Hana and Kip and put it on the Patient and Katherine Clifton, thereby missing the narrative trail of the novel as well as the \\\"essence\\\" of it.  Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas put in unengaging, uninspiring, uninvolving, unemotional performances that were obviously intended to convey a great, driving, passionate love-affair to the viewer, but which in fact delivered only an inexplicable, perfunctory liaison between two flat, shallow, uninteresting adulterers. Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and unexciting, and neither performance provided the viewer with the great emotional response obviously intended by Minghella's grandiose and overblown presentation.  The \\\"grand, sweeping, David-Lean-like\\\" qualities to which the many undiscriminating reviewers of this goofy film love to refer simply is not there. The comparison to David Lean (\\\"Dr. Zhivago\\\") is positively insulting to yet another great director. Take, for example, the \\\"Patient's\\\" sandstorm scene, which is no doubt one wherein these \\\"grand, sweeping\\\" qualities are believed to have resided (or should have resided): the sandstorm is not grand -- it is not even convincing. The subsequent burying of the characters in the automobile and their emergence after the storm, which no doubt was supposed to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally, completely lacked either drama or emotion --in fact, because it was so patently weak, it had an air of comedy about it where comedy was clearly out of place.  This film failed. It failed as a rendering of the novel, and it failed as a film. It seems to have been the \\\"anointed Oscar vehicle\\\" of the year (joining such over-trumpeted filmic slosh as \\\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\\" or \\\"Terms of Endearment\\\"). One can only thank God that even the hype-driven Acadamy  had the good sense to present the Best Actress award to Frances McDormand for her truly deserving performance in the truly excellent film, \\\"Fargo.\\\" There was not a single performance in the execrable \\\"English Patient\\\" that was not either embarrassingly horrid over-acting (Willem Dafoe) or truly forgettable, mediocre acting (Fiennes and Scott Thomas).  Why this non-entity of a film retains a coven of fanatical (and clearly tasteless) devotees will remain a mystery. Fortunately, the sands of time will bury this mediocrity of a film permanently, and it will not, thankfully, have the strength ever to dig itself out.\", \"This is the dreary tale of the self absorbed affair between two unlikable people, one of whom is married to someone else. It ranks high on my list of most boring movies ever, and I'm a die hard romantic. My husband opted out after the first hour of its three, by which time little had transpired. The desert scenery is spectacular, with the endless sand and the sunshine on Katharine's golden hair. However, cinematography does not a brilliant film make, unless it's a National Geographic travelogue. The magnificent Saharan scenery in this ill conceived tale is like putting perfume on a pig.  The movie revolves around a badly burned, dying pilot named Count Laszlo de Almasy, who is left in the care of a Canadian army nurse, Hana, during World War II Italy. He appears to remember little of his life but through a book in his possession, his story is VERY SLOWLY revealed, with the help of a man from his past named Caravaggio, who mysteriously appears at his deathbed. Almasy was a Hungarian cartographer employed by the Royal Geographical Society to chart the Sahara Desert. He entered into an affair with the wife, Katherine, of a fellow explorer who proved to be a British spy. Meanwhile in the present, Laszlo's nurse has her own affair with a Sikh nicknamed Kip, who is involved in the dangerous work of disarming mines.  My quarrels with this movie are many, length and tedium for starters. I don't fault the acting in particular, it simply isn't a good story. Caravaggio seems unnecessary, his connection to Almasy sketchy. He provides a torture scene but appears to serve no essential purpose in the film.  The core problem is that the two parties of this affair, Almasy and Katharine, are woefully unsympathetic characters, shallow and dull. They simply aren't very nice, thus there is no one to cheer for. Almasy is cool, aloof, haughty, and eventually disgustingly possessive of another man's wife. Katharine is likewise detached and nasty, not to mention having a deplorable lack of guilt or feeling whatsoever for her imperfect but loving husband...apart from managing one minuscule tear at the corner of her eye when he dies.   This is a tale of LUST rather than love, with such pearls as 'I can still taste you'. Almasy ridiculously vocalizes to a colleague his erotic obsession with the indentation in his beloved's neck, surely more indicative of a focus on Katharine's body. The victim of this unrepentant adultery is the hapless husband, Geoffrey, who is treated as little more than an unpleasant nuisance. It's all quite sordid and disgusting, Katharine's charade of feeling faint so that these lovers can indulge in their much vaunted unbridled passion, all as Silent Night is being sung in the background. I'm not sure whether the intent was to contrast the carol's purity with their selfish lust, but I definitely was not impressed by the sacrilegious undertone. We have full frontal nudity with Katharine, but their sex scenes come across as cold, selfish, lustful, and sometimes downright hateful...not warm, loving, giving, nor even truly passionate. If either of these two feels any emotion for the other, it is a totally selfish one and definitely NOT love, as I define the word.  Almasy's return to the Cave of the Swimmers to retrieve the body of his beloved comes across as contrived rather than moving. Katharine must have expired only moments earlier as she shows excellent colour and barely appears dozing, not at all corpse like. Of course this is all for dramatic effect, as the romantics watching this tale (normally I'd be one of them) would not appreciate a decaying, putrid corpse. In order to retrieve his adulterous lover's body, he has betrayed his comrades & the Allies by giving his maps to the Nazis, the English being cast as the villains of the piece. Regardless of whether or not he's keeping his final promise to Katharine, his traitorous act is not something I admire much.   Kip seems a pleasant fellow and Hana generally likable, but their romance is not in the least engaging, merely a brief wartime fling with the parties indicating little trauma upon parting. Moving back and forth between the two settings (past Sahara Desert and present Italy) proved distracting and unpleasant but really, both stories were dull as dishwater. The only spark of interest in the whole picture was Kip's tense mine disarming scene.  Not being totally heartless, I did have some sympathy for the current Almasy's severely burned and dying state. However, perhaps my major complaint with this film is the euthanasia at the end when Hana obliges her patient by giving him a morphine overdose. We are supposed to feel that this is justified and morally acceptable because she obviously has affection for Almasy, cries while she is preparing the deadly syringe, and reads aloud from his allegedly passionate Herodotus book to console him as he's dying.   The amazing director David Lean's masterpieces should not be insulted by comparison with this pathetic, immoral tale. Yes, Lawrence of Arabia also has a desert, but in Lean films (Doctor Zhivago, Brief Encounter), those engaging in affairs are sympathetic characters exhibiting admirable restraint, guilt, and some regard for the betrayed spouse, as opposed to the total self absorption of this pair. In Ryan's Daughter, the cuckold husband displays touching loyalty and forgiveness.   This movie is a supposedly intellectual, enormously over rated bit of boring and disgusting drivel that unfortunately passes itself off as a great love story. Its Best Picture Oscar does not speak well for the Academy. For those who wonder why people are so hard on this movie, the answer is simple. It's awful.\"], \"review_score\": [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 7, 10, 9, 9, 8, 7, 9, 10, 8, 10, 10, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10, 9, 10, 2, 1, 1], \"review_category\": [\"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 8.5}, \"Entrapment\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0137494\", \"total_review_count\": 8, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"I did not go into \\\"Entrapment\\\" expecting too much, and well, there wasn't much. I have come to the conclusion that there are only two reasons why people may like this movie and both have to do with the two leading stars. Sean Connery is universally seen as the best looking older man and his Scottish charm is of course also one of his attractions. Then there is Catherine Zeta Jones, a red-hot newcomer whose luscious figure would make any man want to watch. \\\"Entrapment\\\" is a perfect example of a Hollywood star film, which has the sole purpose of raking in as much cash as possible. Any attraction to the film is based entirely on its stars. I saw the movie with a number of people who liked it, and when I was discussing it with them, all of their praise was based on the two leads.  The director, Jon Amiel is generally an unknown film-maker to most people. He has done \\\"Copycat\\\" and \\\"Sommersby\\\", both of which are average films and whose success can be attributed to the stars. \\\"Entrapment\\\" does not contain any breakthroughs in terms of editing or cinematography, and it certainly does not have an original plot. We have seen the formula that makes this movie many times, perhaps in varying inflections, but essentially the same. So what's left, entertainment value. Many people reading this review may think that I do not look at films in terms of entertainment value. Not the case. There are many films that I have given excellent reviews to based entirely on the merit of entertainment. Two recent examples that I can think of are \\\"Cruel Intentions\\\" and \\\"Go\\\". But \\\"Entrapment\\\" lacks anything close to what might have been an entertaining or interesting plot. The idea of basing a heist that will only work if it is conducted on New Years of the Millennium is a great idea. I would love to see a film about the meticulous planning and the execution of such an endeavor. \\\"Entrapment\\\" tries to accomplish too much and ends up leaving such huge plot holes that the film feels rushed and absurd.  Gin (Catherine Zeta Jones) takes on the role of an insurance agent/undercover thief who hooks up with Robert (Sean Connery) a rich career criminal to execute a couple of huge international heists. They train together in Robert's castle. There are a few scenes here that I enjoyed. I especially liked the scenes of Gin practicing avoiding lasers simulated by strands of yarn  Of course Robert and Gin have a romantic tension that is complicated by the rules of being a thief. You can not trust each other if you're romantically involved, right? At first, they do not seem to get along. Hollywood loves to put together two misfits who have to put aside their differences to accomplish some task. This formula has marked the cop-buddy film for years. Take for instance the first Lethal Weapon. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover at first hate each other. And in \\\"Die Hard: With a Vengeance\\\" Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson did not at first get along, but in the end their differences are put aside and they emerge as friends.  \\\"Entrapment\\\" also exists as a catalyst to Hollywood's ongoing trend to have romantic encounters between young, extremely attractive women, and much older men. There is a forty year age difference between Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta Zones. Other recent examples of this trend include Michael Douglas and Gyneth Paltrow in \\\"A Perfect Murder\\\" and Harrison Ford and Anne Heche in \\\"Six Days Seven Nights\\\". This trend is not necessarily a negative thing, but in \\\"Entrapment\\\", it's just too blatantly obvious and cliched.  \\\"Entrapment\\\" is a movie that had potential, but got lost in a number of cliches and its hurriedness. Connery and Jones do have chemistry and look good together, but forget the romantic tension; leave it for romantic films. Forget the first heist; it feels like filler to keep us occupied until the final scenes and climax. A strong film could have been made with the planning of the year 2000 heist. Because it would be the heist of the century, so many ideas could have been developed which would have made for a much more entertaining film.  ** out of ****\", \"I was very disappointed in the story line of this film. The cast did an admirable job with an over-blown, far-fetched plot. Also, there are many discrepancies in the relationships between the characters. Obviously the writer and director were trying to confuse the audience by hiding the \\\"true\\\" identities of some of the characters. There is nothing wrong with that in this type of movie. However, doing so by having characters say and do things that openly contradict earlier scenes is not excusable. The performances of Connery, Zeta-Jones, and Rhames are very good considering what they had to work with as far as dialogue goes. As a gen-x male, I must applaud the appearance of Catherine Zeta-Jones. WOW!!!! It almost made everything else seem unimportant.\", \"  Trapped was how I felt while watching the film Entrapment. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I went through the other reviews and was thoroughly surprised to read that there were many people out there who enjoyed the movie. My thinking is that - what was there to enjoy? The plot was unoriginal, the script lame and the acting absolutely soulless. As far as I was concerned, it could have been two unknowns as the lead actors and the effect would have been the same. It is such a waste that big names like Connery and Zeta-Jones were used for a humdrum movie like this.  Much was said about the \\\"chemistry\\\" between the two leads. Romantic, intriguing, charming were some of the words I saw being used to describe the relationship. I beg to differ. I would use more befitting words like contrived, incestuous and downright disgusting. Didn't anyone notice the 40-year age gap between them? Had they kept their relationship purely professional, then the movie would have been slightly more palatable.  There were two reasons why I decided to watch the movie. First was the two leads and second, the filming location. Having being disappointed by the former, I was hoping that the latter would have been the saving grace. Being a Malaysian, I was eager to watch how the Petronas Twin Towers, currently the tallest building in the world, would have looked on the big screen. Of course, a sense of pride enveloped me when the first few glimpses of the majestic towers were shown. It is not often that major movie productions come here for filming. Although some scenes were manipulated (like the scene when Connery and Zeta-Jones were on a boat on the Malacca river with the Twin Towers on the background. Malacca and Kuala Lumpur are over 100 km apart!), I couldn't help but feel a sense of fulfillment whenever a familiar setting was shown. Notwithstanding the fact that none of the actors who potrayed Malaysians were actually from Malaysia. Perhaps \\\"Anna and the King\\\" starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fatt would do justice to talented local actors. This remains to be seen as the movie is still actively shooting here.  In conclusion, I feel that unless you're a Malaysian, there's nothing that the movie can offer that's groundbreaking. You'll leave the cinema with a hollow feeling and will find yourself hard-pressed to recall a scene that will make an impact in your movie-going life.\", \"It all seemed so perfect. Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones in a cat-and-mouse thriller. How could that go wrong?  Well I still don't know how, but it did, big time.  The movie opens up well enough. We get treated to a high-tech, Mission: Impossible style break in. A mysterious person watching from the shadows. The viewer gets right into it.  Fifteen minutes later all of the suspense goes right out the window.  The first key to a thriller like this is having characters who remain a mystery throughout the movie. Zeta-Jones spills the beans about her character in the said fifteen minutes, and Connery is merely an art thief that everybody in the WORLD knows about.  Key two: A duel of the minds. You can't tell me for one second that you ever thought that Zeta-Jones could outsmart a stump of wood, let alone Connery.  Chemistry, 0.  Dialogue, repetitive and just plain stupid (ie. \\\"You should take a look at the facts!\\\" \\\"Why don't you take a look at the facts?\\\" \\\"Why should I take a look at the facts?\\\")  Suspense, a bit. The robbery scenes are well done, but they always seems effortless.  As far as continuity, this is basically a big wiffle ball of a plot.  A rental if you're desperate... maybe.  4/10  \", \"Yes, Catherine Zeta-Jones is good looking and Sean Connery used to be The James Bond. But these two facts aren't enough to make a movie on. The acting is poor and some really good \\\"high-tech\\\" action scenes mixes with some attempts to \\\"love-and-romance\\\". I don't know but there is something wrong when CZJ tries to act as someone who is very clever but just acts like a stupid insurance agent. The supporting acting by Ving Rhames is good, very good, why doesn't he get a lead...\", \"Easily the worst movie this year. If you're looking for character development, good dialogue or a halfway decent plot, this is the wrong movie. Even if you're looking for Catherine Zeta-Jones' butt, you're still going to be disappointed. (You saw it all in the previews.) The only compelling aspects of the completely 2-dimensional characters were due to the fact that he's Sean Connery and she's Catherine Zeta-Jones. But even James Bond with a Hellenesque beauty at his side cannot save this cerebrally-challenged script.  The worst part is that it was too painful to make fun of. If a cheap and bad horror movie is a man falling off of his bike that you can laugh at (and sometimes laughs with you), than \\\"Entrapment\\\" is a catastrophic and very painful train wreck. If your Connery/Zeta-Jones fix is unsatiated. Go rent \\\"Goldfinger\\\" and \\\"Zorro.\\\" If you just want to get out of the house, please save yourself and see \\\"The Matrix.\\\"  \", \"Why was this movie made..?! Sean Connery seemed to sleepwalk through his lines. There was no chemistry between him and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Ok, I have to rant a little bit. I will always give good movies their due, but this movie was terrible.  SPOILERS:  1) When they are in the big party scoping out the castle to get ready to steal the mask or whatever, the clock says 10:30 pm. Next we see them under the castle blowing up the floor to match the clock bells at midnight. So this HUGE extravagant party was over and everybody completely cleared out in 1 and a half hours? Maybe they came back the next night, but I don't think so. With this movie's pacing and direction, it was impossible to tell what day was what, when things happened etc.  2) That stupid looking Mega-Tower that they were to infiltrate. Give me a break. Hmmmm, big sky-walk 1000 feet off the ground, I wonder if the thieves are going to somehow end up hanging on it or falling from it...wow what a surprise! They did!  3) The ending was plain atrocious. Sean's friend lets him go because of some stupid fake kidnapping plot? They finally caught the art thief of the century and they are guarding him with..hmm...2 cops? GAWD, I get so sick of this crap.  I could go on, but you get the picture. If you are smart, you will not get THIS picture.\", \"Sean Connery plays an old but avid master-thief and Catherine Zeta-Jones a not to be trusted insurance-agent. They team up to the biggest jackpot of all time: 8 billion dollars.  This is the worst movie I've seen in 5 years, probably since 'The Avengers'. Why this piece-of-junk-script was ever sold and developed into a big-budget-movie like this is far beyond me. There are so many plotholes and ridiculous facets in this monster, I can't even begin to describe.  **SPOILERS** Ok, I'll try for the ones that linger most: Zeta-Jones doing those ridiculous ballet-moves to dodge laserbeams; she can dodge in in 2:30mins but dodge out in 30 secs; in the end they give back the 8 billion dollars minus 1 billion; like they didn't notice!  Furthermore, the directing is horrible. The main characters are dramatically swinging from left to right and Sean Connery actually gives a bad performance, which is something to achieve. I wasn't impressed by Zeta-Jones yet and this movie didn't improve it.  I'm trying very hard not to take it personal that these kind of movies get made, because they're a downright insult to the public and solely made for the purpose of making money and making it big.

It follows Thomas Mallory's \\\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\\" fairly accurately. This is something rarely achieved by other films focused on the genre. The casting is excellent, Nigel Terry portrays both the naive boyish Arthur and the elder statesman with great panach\\u00e9. Helen Mirren makes for a convincingly evil Morgan Le Faye whilst the gorgeous Cheri Lunghi shines as Arthur's bride. Lancelot is convincing as he struggles with divided loyalties but the main credit for the film's success must surely go to Nicol Williamson as Merlin. The film attempts to portray a dark period of English history and this is convincingly portrayed in the atmosphere, costume and make up of the actors but by adopting a light hearted portrayal of a serious character, he manages to balance just the right amount of comic relief. Towards the film's conclusion the charge of the knights through the orchard to the sound of a choir singing the \\\"Carmina Birana\\\" has to be one of the high points of British cinema.\", \"This movie is animated fantasy. It shows the mythical aspects of the arthurian legend, a world of wonder, wizards, violence - and Wagner. His music (especially from \\\"Tristan und Isolde\\\" and \\\"Parsifal\\\") appoints to the film its tragic and melancholy atmosphere. The characters are a little flat, ok, but its not a plot written by Dostojewski or Proust. Its a heroic fairy tale, remembered and told for centuries, and this film gives it a depth till the beginning of our world. SEE IT!!!\", \"Try to tell your average moviegoer what makes this a great film and you might have to describe the art direction and larger than life power of the props, sets and fighting. Tell an \\\"authenticity Nazi\\\" about the liberties that Boorman takes with the historic details, and they will roundly criticize it. Tell a student of Arthurian legends of the differences between \\\"L'Morte D\\\"Artur\\\" and \\\"Excalibur\\\" and they might suspect the story is a dumbing-down of the Arthurian legend for the masses.  And that's simply not the point of \\\"Excalibur\\\".  \\\"Excalibur\\\" is filmed with great care and attention to detail in showing the transition that is symbolic of the Dark Ages making way for the new ideas and Christianity taking root. It's about what the king is all about, and why a king has power in our imaginations. It's about vicious wars giving way to hope, and the danger of complacency and comfort. It's about more than it seems.  John Boorman went through incredible pains to make this movie as exacting as he did, and you can see it. He didn't want to merely retell the well known legend of Arthur and his world. He wanted to illustrate the meaning behind Arthur himself. The sword was merely a connection and metaphor for that power and purpose. In the end, the story was about the myth of the king and how his condition was once believed to be the extension and direct representation of the state of the kingdom he actually ruled.  But forgetting all of that, the movie is cool. It's look and feel is something you never forget. The film has the distinction of showing Liam Neeson and Gabriel Byrne in their first movie roles. Nicol Williamson's Merlin is perfect and left me wanting more of him. And for a high school student just researching the realm of mythical and fantastic literature, this movie was addictive when it first came out. I loved it so much.\", \"The Casting was great, especially Merlin. The settings are beautiful and believable which is not the case for most \\\"knight\\\" and dragon movies. The vision of the movie is fluid and only gets slow at certain points, which is totally understandable when considering the task of trying to fit in the whole Authorian legend into one movie. Heart pounding music accompanies exhilarating battle scenes. A must see for any fan of med-evil chivalry.\", \"I saw this movie on opening day,1981.It enthralled and depressed me a little at the same time,and I could never figure out why....till now.I am an Arthurian buff without being a fanatic.I have \\\"Knights of the Round Table\\\",\\\"Sword of Lancelot\\\",\\\"Excalibur\\\",even the obscure\\\"Young Arthur,Warlord\\\"[from british TV.] I've read Tennyson,Mallory,and Steinbeck.I've read historians who have pursued the authentic Arthur. After reading the many comments on this site,I slapped it on again today.Those remarks praising the use of Wagner's music as used in the film were just a little off the mark.This whole film is Wagner minus the arias.Richard would have loved this!There is a near cultish devotion to the nobility of barbarism in it's purest form.Lancelot was heroic ,literally till the armor came off.If Boorman hadn't thrown in the occasional reference to justice for everyone I believe Hitler himself would have financed this film.This is close to Aryan mysticism [without the Aryans].I'm surprised Boorman mellowed to the point he could make \\\"Hope and Glory\\\".Aside from the Wagnerian fatalism,I still love this film! Forget the 14th century plate armor,17th century saddles,and polo ponies with polo bridles.This is still the best Arthur to date!![And if you think this film is long and covers too much ;read Mallory.]\", \"I love Arthuiran Ledgends, and this movie does a great job of translating the best of the Arthurian ledgends. I'm pround to call this one of my favorite movies. Now, if you consider yourself a buff on legend then see this movie, and never see 'First Knight' which was just terrible. I enjoy mostly p***ing on people who claim 'First Knight' is remotely a good movie. Make yourself happy and watch Excalibur, have some dignity.\", \"...and is finished with the blood of men. Boorman's view of a tragic tale of lust and deception and magic and steel is presented without a message. The message is that which you see in the story.  Stand Back, Be Silent, Be Still, and remember.  For it is the doom of men that they forget.  The merlin steals the movie and it doesn't get any better until the end.  \", \"I believe that Excalibur is the very best Arthurian film. It is a brilliant retelling of the Arthurian legend and it gets the story right--he is the once and future king, a messianic figure. Boorman beautifully captures the myth. Spoilers: Furthermore, a line that Sean Connery delivered in Zardoz dully and ineffectively is delivered by Helen Mirren to great effect in this film--you really believe that Morgana wants Merlin's knowledge so badly that she will sacrifice herself. And the ending works so well, you believe in Arthur. The ship heads toward Avalon, somewhere toward the setting sun, to the West. And I love the music, Wagner works so well in this film. A grand film.\", \"Ok. I haven't seen any others so, maybe that is faint praise. However, it is in my top 20 of all-time and I have seen thousands of movies. I would like to comment on some of the other comments I have read here about Excalibur as much as the movie itself. Someone mentioned the music was \\\"ok\\\". It's freakin Wagner!!! It is fabulous for this movie. I don't think a composer alive or at the time of the movie's release (1981) could have created a better original score for the movie. I think Wagner is used better here than in the chopper scene in Apocolypse Now and that is high praise indeed, because that is one of the most magnificent scenes in all of film. You like action? You like fantasy, sex, or blood? Well this is the movie for you. I don't understand what all the fuss is about the sex. It is integral to the plot. Uther's lust destroyed the peace and provided the seed that became Arthur. Arthur' betrayal by Guinevere and Lancelot leads him to be seduced by his half-sister Morgana and impregnate her with Mordred his eventual death sentence. Thankfully, the scenes are erotic and beautifully filmed in stark contrast to the dark and grim life these people lead when not killing. The acting is pretty good as far as I am concerned. I loved Nicol Williamson's Merlin, he is hilarious and eccentric. Helen Mirren's Morgana is sexy and evil. Paul Geoffrey's Perceval ages like 20 years in about 25 minutes and is quite believable. The Boorman family is quite good especially Katrine Boorman as Igrayne (she dances and heaves very well). Her sister Telsche Boorman was the Lady of the Lake and her brother was young Mordred who taunts Perceval. The movie is beautifully lit and has many powerful scenes and images that other better known movies cannot match. I am amazed at the power Boorman was able to capture in many scenes especially the Lady of the Lake, the Last battle, and sunrise boat farewell. Maybe the most amazing thing is how Boorman got so much action and story into so little time (around 2hrs and 15 minutes). He tells the stories of Uther, Merlin, Arthur, Mordred, Morgana, Perceval, Lancelot, and Guenevere, when a single story about any one of them could make up a 90 minute movie. Some in this forum have bitched about the short strokes he makes in characterizations, but he is very deft at telling you enough to push the story along. If you want to know more about a specific character, go read a book about that character. Don't expect to find it all here. Especially a secondary character like Morgana (who is important, but the name of the movie is excalibur, woman will take a backseat in this phallic world, thank you very much). I cry at the end of this movie everytime I see it and part of the reason is because I am sad at the death of Arthur who legend or not was a great man. The other reason is because this is almost perfection in film and it is rarely achieved and it deserves to be appreciated. This is what movies are all about loss, power and redemption, all filmed in breathtaking beauty.\", \"Way back in 1981 I saw this film at the cinema for the first time. It was an incredible experience, in the cinema the mixture of Wagner and powerful (if somewhat violent) images were almost overwhelming. This is not a film that translated so well to television. Much like \\\"Saving Private Ryan\\\" the power of the movie is lost on the small screen. None the less this was a firm favourite amongst young British lads for the next 10 years or so. The film is steeped in dark age pagan mysticism and offers an almost \\\"other worldly\\\" experience to the viewer. This movie was far more impressive then it's contemporary rival the rather silly (though still enjoyed) Conan the Barbarian. I believe that Excalibur remained easily the best sword and sorcery flick until the 2001 release of Lord of the Rings.\", \"John Boorman's Excalibur is a brilliant re-telling of the grand legend of the Western European world, the once and future king, Arthur of Britain. It pares the Malory epic down to its basic core and recreates an entire fantastic world--the myth of Arthur, not the historical reality of Arthur. It suceeds magnificently. If you love fantasy you will love Excalibur. Furthermore, the music is divine: Siegfried's Funeral March (the sword's motif), more Wagner (Lohengrin and Parzival), plus the Carmina Burana. Highly recommended--all other Arthurian films fade to black and vanish in one's mind once you have seen Excalibur.\", \"This is the best epic movie of all times until now.Great actors,beautiful music and very good work from the director.I have seen this movie almost 50 times and i never get bored to watch it.It takes away from this world.It takes you to other places that only in our fantasy we can see.This movie is not just a fantastic story about King Arthur,it also contains very good messages for those who can see them.The higher you go - the farther you'll fall!The only thing that i can not understand is why all of the actors(expect Helen Mirren)did not continue with great movies after that and they just move aside making movies(BAD movies),that no one knows.\", \"Basically Excalibur is a contemporary retelling of Arthurian legend. The cast is an exceptionally strong ensemble of Anglo-Irish talent like Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson and Nicol Williamson. It's also got an epic feel to it (not surprising given the source material) with a lengthy running time and a plot that spans decades.  I don't think it's that outlandish to say that this film was Boorman's labour of love, it's very well crafted; sumptuous cinematography, lavish sets, lean dialogue, brilliant music (various Wagner efforts performed by the London Philharmonic) and a range of interesting characters that each has an arc that develops in tandem with the story.  Tonally the film (purposefully) wanders wildly from darkness to light; the acts are very clearly defined; first the Kingdom is established and flourishes; which leads to betray and the emergence of evil in the second, then in a blistering third act there is a muted sense of forgiveness and resolution. The first act is very entertaining and full of familiar stories (the Sword in the Stone & the Knights of the Round Table) the second act where Lancelot and Guinevere get their rocks off is all about the melodrama and the third act is a searing blend of startling imagery, fierce battles, sorcery and redemption that really does mark out Excalibur as an extraordinary piece of cinema.  There are some amazing moments that stick in the mind; the opening \\\"teaser\\\" (for want of a better word) in which Merlin counjours up the dragons breath so Uther Pendgragon can ride across a great expanse of nothingness to bed his rivals wife and play his part in creating the future King. Perceval's search for the grail through a nightmarish vision of medieval Britain, the bright red sun setting over the body strewn ground as Arthur and Mordred face off against each other in a brutal and bloody embrace....  Overall, all the ingredients of a great film are present and accounted for, and I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who have never seen or heard of this movie but who, should they ever see it, may actually end up loving it almost as much as I do.\", \"The time around 500 A.D. truly represented the Dark Ages in England. The Romans had left Britannia, and the native Britons were dealing with an invasion of Angles and Saxons from mainland Europe. While the origins of the Arthur legend are obscure, the story is well known. Arthur, Merlin the Magician, Sir Lancelot, and Guinevere are familiar characters to most people, who know the story of the Knights of the Round Table. Arthur is generally thought to be a real person of this era, but no one really knows for sure.  Of course, while there's no concrete, verifiable record of Arthur or the other characters in this film, that doesn't matter; director John Boorman has created a movie that is magnificent in its scope, and vividly tells the Arthurian legend in entertaining style. The film pulls no punches in its portrayal of the brutal, difficult time of the late 5th and early 6th centuries. During battles, men didn't hide and shoot weapons at one another from cover, instead they clubbed and stabbed each other to death in hand-to-hand combat, resulting in bloody carnage on a massive scale. Boorman also has included some pretty steamy sex scenes, showing us that life during these times was not all bloodshed and battle.  The movie gives us colorful portrayals of Merlin, the sword Excalibur, the Lady in the Lake, and the ascent of the young Arthur. Eventually the Knights of the Round Table fall into disorganization and decay, only to be acquitted on the battlefield by an older Arthur and Lancelot, who find glory one final time. Long but never boring, bloody but realistic, \\\"Excalibur\\\" is simply enchanting and enthralling. Try to catch the widescreen version\\u0097you're cheating yourself otherwise.\", \"Patrick Stewart had a bit part in this movie, and Liam Neeson played Sir Gawain. I wondered while I was watching it if either of them ever regretted being in such a bad movie. Besides the acting, one of the worst things about this one was that all of the knights wore headbands (as if we didn't know it was made in the eighties), and were always wearing full plate armor! If they had also worn spandex, the headbands would have been understandable, but wearing the armor all day, every day as opposed to normal clothing, was a bit trying on a person's common sense.  It was pretty ridiculous from a factual and realistic point-of-view, and pretty much worth missing.\", \"There have been quite a number of comments here which either praise this movie to the heights (making it sound like the second coming of \\\"Citizen Kane\\\"), or note that it really, really sucks (making it the resurrected corpse of \\\"Howard the Duck\\\"). Variety, Extremes: Isn't that one of the things that makes us humans great?  I tend to take a more moderate position on this film, though far closer to the sugar end than the fuzzy end of the lolly-pop. This film has some wonderful things going for it: Some brilliant casting (Nicol Williamson is incredible--Helen Mirren terrific), great use of music (I don't care for Wagner, but his bombast is perfect for this movie. Carl Orff was a good choice as well), some beautiful cinematography and sets (some scenes almost take my breath away, like when The Sword is thrown into the water), imagination (I've never seen intercourse in full armor before), and a great story.  Unfortunately, it also has some bad casting (who in the world picked Cherie Lunghi to play Guenevere?--flower child as mythological queen? They could have done better by Lancelot as well), a few not so great lines, and, worst of all, the pacing is often too frenetic. If one is going to film the entire Arthurian legend, there is no way you can squeeze it into 2 hours and 20 minutes--not and have coherence. Some have said it was too LONG, and I can understand why they might come to that conclusion--so many scenes, so much plot thrown at us, that for some it must have had a dulling effect. The mind can only absorb so much in 2 & 1/3 hours. So cut it down so there isn't SO much to take in. Understandable, but the wrong remedy. It should have been extended by at least an hour, giving us more time to appreciate all the beauty, all the personalities (Merlin could have used more screen time, and some of the Knights could have stood further development), all the carnage, all the story in this film. Still, the good out weighs the bad by a considerable amount, imho. I can't help feeling disappointed, though. Just a few changes and we would be talking about the film in the same breath as \\\"Casablanca,\\\" \\\"Vertigo,\\\" or \\\"The Third Man.\\\" Too bad. We could always use another masterpiece. [8.5 out of 10]\", \"Having read \\\"the knights of the round table\\\" as a child, and \\\"Le Morte D'Artur\\\" in old English as an adult, I have always been profoundly touched by this story of rise, fall, love, hate, betrayal and hope. As a result, I have developed an intense dislike for most pathetic attempts to put this story on film.  Excalibur is the first, and so far, the only film, in my opinion, to come very close to the brass ring.  First some ranting.  The early film with Cornel Wilde was a swashbuckling story, no more.  The Disney cartoon \\\"sword in the stone\\\" was one of the first in a long series of extremely offensive attempts to take inspirational and tragic stories and turn them into something banal.(Anastasia, The hunch Back of Notre Dame to name a couple)  First knight was perfect for displaying Richard Geere's lack of talent, and wasting a perfectly good actor (Connery). This ranks up there with \\\"Plan nine from outer space\\\"  Excalibur has put faces to the characters I read about. It infused them with personalities, and gave them life beyond the pages.  I was transposed by Merlin's magic on the mountain top, awakening the dragon. I felt a strange elation when Arthur drew the sword, one of the most meaningful and defining moments in literary, and now movie, history. I trembled and rejoiced when Arthur handed Excalibur to Uriens and was knighted. And my eyes welled up with tears when the ship took his body away to Avalon  And the music... That glorious music, never intrusive, but always suggestive and underlining the drama subtly.  After seeing this movie, anyone hearing Carl Orff Carmina Burana's Deres Luna will forever associate it with courage, rebirth sacrifice and redemption.  Anyone seeing this movie will be moved to believing that one day Arthur may indeed return to redeem us all. It tells us that hope never dies.\", \"This must be one of the best movies ever made. Boorman shows with this movie what a great director he is, and I can't wait to see his new movie with Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voigt. Boorman has an excelent eye for how to make art-work of a movie and Excalibur is no exception. He has put together some not-so-famous actors, and yet he managed to make them more trustworthy than most of the more famous actors. It is just sad that it doesn't seem to be Boorman who will be making the saga \\\"Lord of the Rings\\\" into an epic movie. My recommendation to all is: watch this movie and forget about the newly shot mini-tele movie with Sam Neill.\", \"Have seen this film quite a few times and never tire of it as it is a brilliant depiction of the Arthurian legend and Camelot. The sets were fantastic and WHAT a cast! I've seen a lot of films that involve knights on horseback and guys fighting each other with swords dressed in armor but this is the only one with hugely over the top acting and way too out of this world grossly exaggerated dialog. Merlin, played by Nichol Williamson is incredible in this and put in one hell of a performance, much to the surprise of the directors who, as rumor had it, wanted to recast him!! Patrick Stewart puts that booming voice of his to good use too on more than one occasion!! This is by far the best film made in Ireland in the '80s. It also covered the story of King Arthur better than any other film before or since.\", \"Most certainly among the best tellings of the timeless legend. It's visually stunning, with an undeniably grandiose and epic quality, no doubt fueled by the superb performances.  In fact, this is among the finest fantasy adventures created, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Conan the Barbarian and the Lord of the Rings (which was ironically what John Boorman initially intended to make). Some early and even a few debut performances grace the film, such as Liam Neeson, Gabriel Byrne, and Helen Mirren.  Some have argued that the full plate armor donned by the knights is not \\\"historically accurate.\\\" Seeing as King Arthur is a legendary and/or mythical figure who may not have existed at all, this is not a terribly valid criticism. Furthermore, much of the myth surrounding King Arthur that many are familiar with comes from a work published in 1485 (Thomas Mallory's Le Mort D'Arthur), a time when armor design was at its zenith and plate armor was common amongst those who could afford it, i.e. knights and other nobility.  I really don't have much criticism. I was not in the least bothered by the depiction of Arthur and his knights in full plate armor when engaged in battle. But it was more than a bit silly to see everything else from feasting to sex also portrayed in full armor.   Such small issues did not detract from the splendor of the film. It is passionate, violent, with a mystical aura that enhanced the settings. Highly recommended.\", \"This is the only movie I know of to make the attempt to take the events of the Arthurian legend as seriously as possible, portraying them as realistically as possible, thereby making this the best film version of the legend to date. That's what is captivating about this movie. The events are approached with total emotional reality. The film creates a world in which these events really happen, there's no jarring pull back to reality while watching it. The special effects hold up fairly well because there isn't an over-reliance on them to begin with. Knowing that CGI techniques are so prevalent tends to make me hyper aware of them in movies that use them, creating friction that makes it harder to suspend my disbelief. I don't want to sit there spotting the special effects, I want to live in the film for the time I am watching it. Excalibur achieves this in spades. Excellent casting. Excellent acting, really appropriate and gorgeous costume design. One of my all time very best movies ever, especially viewed through the lens of Jungian psychology.\", \"Excalibur, Starring Nigel Terry, Nicol Williamson, Helen Mirren, Cheri Lunghi, Nicholas Clay, Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, Gabriel Byrne, Robert Addie, Katrine Boorman, Paul Geoffrey, Clive Swift Director John Boorman, 1981 Director John Boorman and screenwriter Rospo Pallenberg worked on adapting the centuries old Thomas Malory epic \\\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\\" into a stunning, intensely dramatic movie masterpiece the likes of which had never been seen before. This is, for me, the most definitive version of the Arthurian saga. There is so much to admire about this film and so much to analyze but for lack of time on IMDb I can only offer portions of my praise. Boorman masterfully captures the grandiosity as well as the humanity of the fantasy legend about a young innocent who draws a sword from a stone and inherits the right of kingship, establishes the beautiful city of Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table, who protect the innocent and rid the world of evil, and search endlessly for that most elusive religious artifact - the Holy Grail. First of all, we must look beyond the fantasy elements and the special effects which everyone enjoys - the magic sword Excalibur, itself a symbol of strength and kingship (in the film the Lady of the Lake who gives the sword to Arthur and who receives it again in the finale is played by one of Boorman's daughter Telsche Boorman), the elaborate details of the medieval, Celtic-Christian England from the clothing, to the fortresses, to the armor and weapons, and we must see into the heart of the long epic. First off, Nigel Terry and Nicol Williamson as Arthur and Merlin carry the movie. Their relationship as mentor and prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 has never been most wonderfully portrayed, their friendship as two men who try desperately to fulfill the ideals of brotherhood and who fail has never been more poignantly captured. The most moving part for me is still the climatic finale, in which, after the death of Arthur, and the world seems to have ended, Excalibur is brought back to the Lake and Three mysterious queens take Arthur away on a barge, all this while the dramatic music to Wagner's Siegfried's Funeral March blares triumphantly. Boorman used the music of Wagner's operas most effectively in the relevant spots in the film- the sensual Prelude to Tristan and Isolde plays as Lancelot and Guenevere have their tryst in the forest, the spiritual, ethereal strains of the Good Friday/Holy Grail music from Parsifal plays as Parsifal himself encounters the Holy Grail and Siegfried's Funeral March from Gotterdammerung opens and closes the film as both the Sword Theme and the tragic motif of Arthur's heroic death. The relationship between King Arthur, Queen Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi) and Lancelot (Nick Clay) is also well-developed. For once, we realize how the Queen loved her husband as a king, but because he was so consumed by his duties, she could not love him as a husband. Instead, she finds romantic-sexual gratification in an affair with Lancelot. The Quest for the Holy Grail could have been further elaborated but this is a minor quibble. The film builds up to a fiery finale. The character of the wicked sorceress Morgana (Helen Mirren) is also a strong point, and one everyone misses. She was only a small child (played by Barbara Byrne) when she witnessed the rape of her mother Igrayne (played by Boormans' daughter Katrine) by Uther. This single moment of deception and witchcraft triggered her mistrust of all men and ruins her innocence. She becomes a corrupt, greedy, power-hungry witch who even manages to trap Merlin in an icy cave. Her vengeance against Arthur brings about the final destruction as her evil son Mordred and Arthur fight to their own deaths. Well-known British actors live up to their own possible Arthurian/Brittanic heritage. Patrick Stewart (Captain of the Enterprise on Star Trek) is doing a superb performance as is Liam Neeson even though their roles are minor as knights of the Table. Clive Swift, Sir Kay, is better known as a comic actor in the British series \\\"Keeping Up Appearances\\\" he plays Hyancinth's husband Richard. The look of the film is a tapestry of moods. Green is magic, silver-metallic is mankind's power, the forest is a place where Lancelo and Guenvere revel in their primitive essence. It's a world of dark and light, spring and winter, happiness and despair, illusion, but other than its good versus evil themes there are many layers. Humanity is flawed, the end of the world is coming, but the world may still be renewed again. There is no greater truth than this.\", \"John Boorman's semi-adaptation of La Morte D'Arthur may come as something of a surprise, albeit a pleasant one, as the usually glamorised and fanciful tale is furnished in grimly realistic fashion. The armour, weapons and castles all look very authentic, and indeed it is in the battle sequences that the film excels, especially due to the stirring music selected to accompany each pivotal scene.   Purists will doubtless find plenty to frown and \\u0091tut' about, but doing justice to the Arthurian legends in film is a monumental task and Boorman delivers a true classic. Acting is fine, although dialogue is shouted more than spoke, and delivered with all the subtlety of a flanged mace. Nicol Williamson stands out in particular as the creepy Merlin, but it's fun to see Helen Mirren, Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson paving their ways to future stardom.   Of course, if the film has any reputation at all it is with its vicious battle scenes, which are still gory even today. They are, it has to be said, very welcome, because without the depictions of desperate, hand-to-hand battle, you might start comparing it with First Knight \\u0096 which would be something close to sacrilege.   My older DVD copy looks fine but sounds a bit tinny, so it's with some annoyance I see there's a special edition out now, which presumably has had the full restoration work done on it. If you haven't seen Excalibur but have an interest in the subject (and hated First Knight), you should certainly give it a try.\", \"I have seen the movie Excalibur many times, and I believe it is an excellant movie. Many people say that it was cheezy looking (Yes, Excalibur the sword does get a tad flexible at points.) However, was not The Day the Earth Stood Still cheezy too, yet it is one of the greatest movies of all times, most people agree. And if anyone tries to down the movie by claiming it was not true to the legends, I have read many Arthurian texts, and the legend is not true to the legends. John Boorman picked through the haystack, and found his needle. Another excellant thing about this movie is for the most part, the acting is underscored. Not like in many modern movies, I believe Nicol Williamson, Helen Mirren, all the actors from the round table, and Mrs. Boorman did excellant jobs. The only complaints I had were so minor they practically do not exist. So go, see the movie, and be swept away.\", \"Excalibur is a truly atmospheric film. It has the ability to take you back to the time it depicts, without using sentimentality or rose tinted spectacles. Having seen the film numerous times, I still get more out of it with every viewing. It certainly seemed to start many careers on the right path and many of the actors are very well known now. My only sadness is that Paul Geoffrey and Nigel Terry, two of the main character actors, seem not to have become such household names. They both stand out in the film and to my mind have made it what it is, brilliant. Great direction, production, photography and music. King Arthur himself would have been proud of it.\", \"Late in the film, King Arthur is about to fight his last battle against his estranged son Mordred. His kingdom of Camelot is falling. The knights of the Round Table are disbanding. Guinevere has entered a convent. In short, Arthur's world is collapsing. He rides to the nunnery to see Guinevere for the last time. And there, she produces the ancient timeless object hidden beneath some linen: the sword Excalibur, still gleaming, still magical, still potent to fight in the battle that Arthur cannot win. He sheathes Excalibur, and, in full knightly regalia rides with his remaining loyal knights through the English countryside, their pennants and banners flying in the wind. The fortissimo chorus of Carmina Burana accompanies their ride in perfect harmony, chanting the lyrics from the medieval poem \\\"O Fortuna\\\". This is the stuff of legend...  Artistic treatments of the Arthurian legends date back to illuminated codices from the Middle Ages. Thereafter the first, and one of the greatest, attempts to bring the stories into a novelistic form was written in the late 1400's by a knight, Sir Thomas Malory, entitled La Morte d'Arthur (\\\"The Death of Arthur\\\") which is probably the most famous work of English letters proceeding Chaucer but before Shakespeare. Even later renditions include T.H. White's \\\"The Once and Future King\\\". By the 20th century, theatrical adaptations began appearing as well, including \\\"Knights of the Round Table\\\" (1953), Disney's \\\"The Sword in the Stone\\\" (1963), and the musical \\\"Camelot\\\" by Lerner and Lowe which was possibly the most popular rendition of the story before \\\"Excalibur\\\". These last renditions, although they have their appeal, cannot measure up to the movie \\\"Excalibur\\\" which was largely based upon Malory's original tome.  Many here have detailed very well the merits of the film, and since most people know the story, I will keep this short. The reason why this is the best of the Arthurian-based films is its imagery and its dedication to the original Arthurian myths. The entire look of the film, which I have not seen in a movie since, reeks of Medieval Legend. The lush forests, the huge castles, and the glittering swords give a visual and dream-like reality. This is NOT how it was in the Middle Ages. This is how people in the Middle Ages would have liked it to have been, which is the entire point of the Arthurian myths. The filmmakers of Excalibur understood that myth is about dreams.  Several moments in the film are inspired directly from Malory and earlier Medieval codices. For example, several Medieval illuminated manuscripts feature the hand of the Lady of the Lake bestowing the sword Excalibur to Arthur. Strangely this episode, which becomes an important theme throughout Excalibur, is lacking from other theatrical versions and yet it is central to the original myth. Another is the strange rhetoric that Arthur and the land are one, and when Arthur becomes ill, the land of his kingdom becomes barren. This concept was a widely held belief in the Middle Ages: that the sovereign was essentially married to the kingdom.  Another aspect that makes this film outstanding is the portrayal of Merlin by Nicol Williamson. This was possibly the best Merlin ever to come to the large screen. Some of the most humorous moments of the film occur with Merlin. Instead of being the absent-minded wizard of \\\"The Sword in the Stone\\\", he is the last of the Druids, a race giving way to Medieval Christians. Worth the price of admission. It is sad that he obtained very little recognition for this portrayal.  The fact is, a viewer either experiences \\\"aesthetic arrest\\\" with Excalibur, or he or she doesn't. If the scenes when the knights go riding through countryside with their pennants flying behind them doesn't give you the shivers, this is not and will never be your kind of movie. If Malory had lived to see this film, he would have been awed and proud. Malory gave Arthur to the world, and Excalibur gave Arthur back to Malory.\", \"Along with Ken Russell, John Boorman can be seen as a key figure in the modern British cinema... His interest in myth, dream, landscape and memory may be compared with that of Resnais, Leone, and Roeg...  Boorman's 'Excalibur' is characterized by his use of jealousy and adultery, sex and sorcery... It is also characterized by fire and fog, shadow and moonlight, creating an air of mystery that is essential element in the Arthurian legend...  Boorman's 'Excalibur' is a mythical presentation leading the viewers to travel with the flow of the legend... It is a magical story with wonderful exotic sets, and interesting camera-work in the lush green scenery of Ireland... (The Cinematography won an Academy Award Nomination).  Boorman's \\\"Excalibur\\\" is both fantasy and philosophy... Love seems to be a destructive force, lyrically beautiful and bravely realistic...  The film brings to life the fateful story of a solitary hero, his ascension to the throne, the love triangle of Camelot, the quest for the Holy Grail, the decline and eventual fall of Arthur and Camelot... Along for the ride are his indispensable Knights of the Round Table, particularly Sir Lancelot...  The characters in Boorman's \\\"Excalibur\\\" are extremely well developed... Arthur is seen as a naive squire, who develops into an idealistic king... Arthur tries to use Might for the establishment of Right, and according to his own laws, he puts reason over love...  A prominent figure in the film is Merlin... He lives backwards, which makes him \\\"a dream to some, a nightmare to others.\\\" He defines the cave of the dragon as a place where all things meet their opposite: \\\"The future and the past, desire and regret, knowledge and oblivion\\\". But when Morgana pronounces \\\"love\\\", one would expect Merlin to answer \\\"hate\\\", but he just says: \\\"O yes.\\\"  Morgana knows that Uther and Merlin are responsible for the death of her father... She dedicates her life to revenge.. Her scenes with Merlin are full of fire and poison... When she steals the \\\"charm of making\\\" from Merlin, Morgana gets stronger... We feared her lines when she affirmed: \\\"I can ease your loneliness.\\\"  Lancelot looks at himself as a sinful person who has betrayed a friend... He stays lonely in the forest, haunted by sorrow and pain... He dreams of a fight with himself... And when he wakes up naked, he sees his own sword stuck in his side... The film endures and inspires because it embodies mankind's deepest yearnings...  Among the many elements that make the movie work is the cast: Nigel Terry, the rightful King who, accidentally, removes the sword of power easily, not once, but twice; Helen Mirren, the enchantress Morgana, Merlin's nemesis and Arthur's treacherous half-sister, who seduces Merlin, and then encircles him in a stream of vengeance; Nicholas Clay, persuasively ardent and athletic as the First Knight; Cherie Lunghi, the damsel in distress who loves her husband with her mind and Lancelot with her heart; Nicol Williamson, the wily Merlin who would see that the young Arthur receive the necessary training and guidance to fulfill his unlikely destiny; Gabriel Byrne, the hot-blooded Uther Pendragon, who plunges 'Excalibur' deep into a stone rock in one last act of defiance; Katrine Boorman, the woman taken as by a fully armored King; Liam Neeson, the knight who dares to accuse the Queen; and Robert Addie, the 'unholy child' who comes to Camelot to demand the throne of his father...  One of the more fascinating aspects of the film (and there are many...) are the differences between Uther and Arthur... King Uther is unable to master his instincts... His world is confusion, disorder, and unlimited passion... The characteristic developments of Arthur occur as he faces the trials of his life... The knowledge of the affair yet his love for his beautiful wife and best friend wage war inside of his mind... When he sees Guinevere in the arms of Lancelot, he stuck 'Excalibur' between them loosing his connection to the extraordinary powers of Merlin and the Lady of the Lake...  John Boorman's films frequently concern contradictions and polarities, tensions between nature and civilization, dream and reality... Equally, his career as a whole swings violently between success and failure, intelligent ambition and pretentiousness...\", \"This is certainly the best version of the Arthur legend there is. The worst thing about new versions of old British legends are the fact they are often made by and starring Americans, and they often don't even make an attempt at a English accent (First Knight, Prince of Thieves etc) and these make them seem really stupid.  Merlin was a decent enough series, but a little too kiddy and straying from the works of Mallory.  The acting is rock solid, the effects although poor (it's 1981, let's be fair) don't really matter since they aren't integral to the story. This is about a quest and magic and swords and knights, not about special effects.  I own it on video and watch it now and again, and I hope that if Boorman ever makes Knight's Castle that he brings back Nicol Williamson as Merlin, because he's just too good in that role (despite the fact he must be really getting on by now).  Watch the movie, enjoy the legend!\", \"At different times in his illustrious career, John Boorman has announced that his intention to make film versions of both The Lord Of The Rings, and Wagners \\\"Ring\\\" cycle.Like Scorsese's plans to do film biographies of Gershwin and Robert Johnson, or Coppola's plans to make versions of Faust and Pinocchio, these grandiose projects have come to nothing. Fortunately, in Excalibur, we have something that comes close..VERY close. Boorman retells the Arthur legend in a way that evokes both the mythic power of Tolkien and the operatic splendor of Wagner.. ( Indeed, the sound track makes frequent use of Wagner.)Some have criticized Boorman for making the story of King Arthur too sexy and violent. Well, in their original , unexpurgated form, the Arthurian legends were just that. Boorman also looks at the Druidic and pagan roots of the arthur story, (\\\" The Land is the King.\\\"), and examines the inner conflict between Paganism and Christianity that gave the myth its original power. A great film, and one of my personal favorites. I have not seen Robert Bresson's version of the Arthur myth, Lancelot Du Lac, but I suspect that it may be the only other one by a major film-maker that comes close to the eerie, mythic, glorious heart of Arthurian legend.\", \"More people telling me their favourite film, have named Excalibur, than have chosen any other film. People tend to feel strongly about this film. I can remember that when it came out, a film magazine reviewed it twice, feeling that it had to do so, since its two reviewers had such contrasting opinions. In short, people who don't adore it, tend to hate it.  Those who hate it have failed to understand something very important: that it is set in the land of dreams. Excalibur makes no attempt to be realistic. It is the film of a legend, and it tries to create a world of legend, and it succeeds. Once one has realised that this is not the real world, then the film is internally consistent and works splendidly. Merlin, towards the end of the film, even says the line \\\"Your love brought me back to where you are: in the land of dreams.\\\" If anything, this makes the film even more tragic, because all of Arthur's sufferings have been not for his world, but for ours.  The Arthurian legend is probably the world's best legend. It has been told a thousand different ways, but is so strong, that no retelling can harm it. The story is familiar, but this telling of it is not. The screen starts blank, with the distant drums of Seigfried's Funeral March playing, and after a few captions, the curtain lifts to reveal a stunning opening sequence with horses breathing fire-lit breath into the night air, as Uther's men do battle with those of the Duke of Cornwall. The armour is dark, and greenish, and the movements slow, making this seem like a scene of battling dinosaurs. It is brutal and bloody. These are the dark ages. This is the time of chaos from which Arthur's kingdom must come. Into the scene, in a cloud of swirling fog, comes a figure who will be present throughout the film, ageless and mysterious, Nicol Williamson's Merlin, whose voice carries over the din.  I remember how suddenly I found myself immersed in this world when I first saw the film, and even now the hairs stand up on the back of my neck thinking about it. Allow yourself to become involved with the film, and you will be rewarded.  The costumes are magnificent. Special mention must go to the shining armour, and Morgana's (Helen Mirren) ever-increasingly impressive series of outfits. The music is stirring (it uses \\\"O Fortuna\\\" from Carima Burana before this had become a cliche). The acting is theatrical and good. Each of these characters is on a stage, to be examined. This is not a film of quiet intimate moments. It is a legend, and legends are public.  Excalibur distills the Arthurian legends into one film of watchable length very cleverly. At several points during it, a clever cut tells the viewer that several years have passed. Single characters represent many things. At one point Sir Percival represents all the questknights, at another Morgana is all that is evil. In telling the story quickly, the film uses simple direct speeches. In one scene, Arthur visits Guinevere, the woman he loved deeply, whom he hasn't seen for many years. He spends just a minute in her company and leaves, and yet the speech he delivers to her is so complete and so moving, that you do not feel robbed. He says his piece and leaves, needing to say no more.  It is true that the film has dated a little. Some of the hair-styles and special effects are not quite what they would be today, and the quality of the dubbing is not first-rate, but this is still stunning. Everything seems to have come together to help this film look and sound good. The skies over the castles are spectacular, the Irish landscape (it was shot there) looks the part. The visual imagination and daring to have Camelot as a castle literally made from silver, and to have Arthur's final battle fought in fog with a huge blood red sunset behind it, makes this a feast for the eye.  I am writing about one of my all-time favourite films. I cry every time I see the land burst into blossom as a reborn Arthur gallops through it, and I feel the heavy warmth of tragedy as he is carried off towards the sunset to the Isle of Avalon. I am spoiling nothing by telling you that Arthur dies in the end. Everyone knows that he dies in the end. The whole film is leading to that moment. When you reach the end of the film, ask yourself this: where did he go wrong? What was it he did to lose his wife, his son, his sister, his best friend, all his questknights, Merlin, his kingdom, his life - everything he held dear?  \\\"The one god of the many comes to drive out the many gods. The spirits of wood and stone grow silent.

I even liked the theme music.  And if ever a flick cried out for a treatment by Joel (or Mike) and the MST3K Bots, this is it! Watch this with a bunch of smart-ass wise-crackers, and you're in for a good time. Have a brew, butter up some large pretzels, and enjoy.  Of course, obtaining a copy requires buying a bootleg or downloading it as shareware, but if you're here on the IMDb, then you're most likely savvy enough to do so. Good luck.  And look for my favorite part....where Dr. Doom informs the FF that they have 12 hours to comply with his wishes....and he actually gestures the number \\\"12\\\" with his finger while doing so....it's like \\\"Evil Sesame Street\\\"....hoo boy.  ...and of course Mrs. Storm declaring \\\"Just look at you....the Fanstastic Four\\\" is just so heartwarming....you'll laugh, you'll cry.....  So if you love schlocky Sci-Fi, this one's Fantastic For you!\", \"Yes! this movie was just bad in every way in things like cast,effects,boredom,excitement,and of course,being fantastic and we all know the four heroes in this one were a bit more colourful compared to the new ones but it still has to go,A fantastic bore like this really was just silly trash which i knew nobody would like when i saw it,i mean surely with that budget about 3 or 4 GOOD movies could have been made but no. I am just glad that the new version made this year totally showed everyone how the fantastic four should have been made with good story,great cast like Jessica Alba one of my favourite actresses otherwise it would have been totally forgotten but thankfully no. The new one was excellent when i saw it with my mates at the cinema but this old fantastic bore has gotta go.\", \"Drifting around on bootlegs, sometimes thought an urban comic book legend, the first FF movie is pretty much as bad as everyone fears. I guess Marvel Comics now pretends it doesn't exist, what with the 2005 version out in theaters earlier this year. But it's out there, a reminder and the last of the first wave of bad, low budget Marvel super-hero adaptations (Captain America, Punisher, most of the TV movies). 'Low budget' is too easy a description for this FF pic. Due to basically no funds, showing the powers of the super foursome was limited to very quick shots (Mr.Fantastic), quasi-animation (Torch), and fades (Invisible Girl-the easiest to do). The Thing suit was not bad and probably half the budget; the face part was especially almost convincing. The acting? Alex Hyde-White as Reed is pretty good; the other 3 are OK, tho Jay as Johnny acts like a spaz at times to sort of show off his 'fiery' temper. The dialog is comic-book style, and it's the supporting cast which ends up floundering trying to make it work. Dr.Doom is way over melodramatic and unintentionally comical, and his two main henchmen are a case study of how not to act or write dialog.  The plot? Not too good. It was quite faithful to the origin story of the FF (more so than the later big budget version), and even though the non-budget, again, restricted showing, for example, the actual crash landing, it kept the essential ingredients of how they discovered their powers in an isolated area - it's the best part of the picture, tho you have to wait a full half-hour for it. I also found the music odd in places; when the 4 are bathed in those cosmic rays, a kind of church choir is heard, as if it's a religious experience. The rest of it, however, is hopeless. Even with no budget, the story could have done without the Jeweler character (resembling the Mole Man villain of the books); it spends way too much time with him and his underground gang, as well as the blind Alicia. These sections are a waste of celluloid and very boring. The climactic struggle with Doom & his men starts fine, but degenerates into an awful mess as the Torch races a laser beam (cool animation but belonging in a cartoon). Fans can have a laugh at the bad FF FX and witless storyline, if they don't get depressed & outraged first.\", \"This is truly awful, the feeblest attempt at a comics adaptation ever committed to film. Every possible thing about this movie that could be bad, is. Music, acting, lighting, sets, \\\"special\\\" effects... about the only positives I can find are that Sue looks cute in her blue tights and that the Thing make-up is almost passable (face only). That's it. Zip. Don't bother tracking down that bootleg copy; it's really not worth your time. Even the aborted \\\"Captain America\\\" movie from the early 90's is far less excruciating than squirming in your seat while you try to endure this mess.\", \"Without a doubt this is the WORSE comicbook movie every made. PERIOD!! Yes, it's worse then Dolph Lundgren's (1989) Punisher. Yup.. worse then the 1979 & 1991 Captain America movies. Oh yeah, it's even WORSE then Christopher Reed scripted Superman IV: Quest for Peace movie. Sheeshh.. that movie was so bad that the guy who played Nuclear Man only starred in one other film and it was only on T.V. =oP  This movie is \\\"D\\\" quality. I had a chance to watch it on the SciFi channel back in 1997. I had heard it was pretty bad, but had nothing else to do that night so I figured I check it out. What a waste of an hour and a half. I would have been better off watching reruns of Different Strokes. Besides having the lamest special effects and worse acting I've ever seen, the whole script was just awful and not well directed at all. Thankfully a NEW Fantastic Four movie is being done and hopefully this version will do the heroes justice. I was hoping for a New SPAWN movie in the future, but it has yet to materialize.   Do not rent this movie. If you happen to see it being televised on cable, check it out. Be warned though, you'll most like be flipping the channel after the first 15 mins.\", \"I have always loved bad creations, rhetorical criticism and my film professor validated that for me in college. This is not as bad as The Star Wars Holiday Special, there is nothing bottom of the lunchbox than that mistake. This The Fantastic Four film, complete with the I-have-no-idea-why-hes-excessively-tweaking-his-fingers Doctor Doom, is high on the list of colossal mistakes. Doom's dialogue \\\"Kill him!...Let him go!\\\" is classic as it is staggering in its hilarity. The editing is good, and the director of photography isn't half-bad...those are the up-sides. I cannot, however, subject all my friends to watch in its entirety, but if I can get the chance I show them the \\\"can Jonny and Sue come to outer space with us!\\\" scene I do. I also include the final scene scene, where Redd Richards in his FF outfit for some reason, alongside his bride Sue in her wedding dress, get into the limo...the payoff is the extendo arm in farewell as they drive away. Most people are in complete disbelief that something like this exists.\", \"this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life .period.this movie goes beyond ridiculous,it is like the director wants to get his ass sued by the actors for wrongfully misrepresenting their roles as the fantastic four,i believe the movie should have been released in comic book stores in order for the only how u should say it,desperate geeks who cant get enough cheesiness and want to see more and more crap movies.in conclusion to my paradox statements and thesis,i do believe this movie has had great disadvantages to the futures of the cast's contributors,with the exception of jay underwood's character,in which i do believe it was his best performance,considering roles such as the not quite human movies in which the story is told in a way that he has no character.he cant act,and people have made good decisions to not go see his movies,this is why he is most likely not going to be any huge roles,unless he sparks his career in a most rare,but interesting way.\", \"Whether or not this adaptation of the Marvel comic was made \\u0096 and shelved \\u0096 so its production company could retain the copyright to the characters, it doesn't change the fact that it's utter rubbish. The Dr. Doom and (especially) Thing costumes are surprisingly good, but everything else suffers from a deficit of either cash or talent. Director Oley Sassone can't even point a camera at stuff without including such howlers as a blind woman's POV, the dialogue is absolutely dismal, the team's costumes don't fit properly, and the effects are appalling: the Human Torch seems to be drawn onto the film with felt tip pens, while Mr. Fantastic's powers are brought to life using a bendy blue stick with a glove on the end. Joseph Culp compensates for having to wear a mask by wildly waving his arms about, Jay Underwood is incredibly annoying, the rest of the cast hit various levels of terrible, and while it's hard not to feel sorry for all these guys who thought this movie would get a release, it's equally difficult to imagine any of them believing it was actually any good.\", \"Admittedly, when the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie, my expectations were pretty low. They weren't low enough. Scholckmaster Roger Corman somehow came into ownership of the rights to produce the Marvel comic book characters sometime in the late 80's or early 90's, and handed it off to Oley Sassone, whose directorial work has largely been in campy TV series such as 'Hercules' and 'Viper'. With a supposed total budget of 1.5 million dollars, it was produced, shot and briefly released on video and then sent to the wasteland of forgotten film. There it should have remained. However, like a banana peel in a vaudeville act, this \\\"Fantastic Four\\\" sits out in the ether waiting to cause a pratfall for those rare people unlucky and foolish enough to step on it.   If you have ever heard of these comic book characters, you know what to expect. The people who made this were very true to the source material, and that is the only thing for which they deserve any credit in this fiasco. This presents the origins of the heroic group that develop superhuman powers when the shielding on their experimental spacecraft fails to protect them from cosmic radiation. Reed Richards (Alex Hyde-White) develops the ability to stretch his body and becomes 'Mr. Fantastic'. His girlfriend, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab) can become invisible, and her brother, Johnny (Jay Underwood) can spontaneously cause fire to erupt from his body. Finally, Ben Grimm ('credited' to both Michael Bailey-Smith and Carl Ciafarlio) receives superhuman strength when his skin mutates to a rock-like hyde and is then referred to as The Thing. There is a prologue that sets up a former classmate of Reed's, Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) to become their enemy, Dr. Doom, who orchestrates the sabotage of the Fantastic Four's space flight as an act of revenge for injuries he blames on Reed. There is the set-up, then the discovery of the powers, the revelation of the villain and ultimately a climactic fight. There are more details to the poorly-written script, but they are negligible.  This is a movie that was made simply because the creators (I use that in the technical sense of the word. There isn't a whole lot of creative imagination at work here.) had the legal rights to do so. The plot will be undoubtedly mirrored in the anticipated big-budget release set to be directed by Tim Story in 2005, but tackling a massive special effects project like this without a comparable budget or qualified actors qualifies as an act of cinematic insanity. What special effects exist are mostly hand drawn or simple camera tricks that have existed since the days of the original 'The Great Train Robbery'. When half of the climactic fight reverts to full-on hand animation, you're almost relieved to be watching a cartoon instead of the poor actors who were damned to be in this project. There is very little consistency of style in this mess as well. Most scenes are either shot flat in available light or wild primary colors, and the only dressed sets are the obvious sci-fi pieces. There is camera-work, but it is mostly just keeping the characters centered on the screen and minimal information flowing to the audience. Editing includes leaving in extra lines and using obvious wipes (at one point there is even a transition using the center of a number 4). Editing spins are even used to supplement the poor special effects when The Thing transforms. The one scene where morphing technology was put to use was shocking only because it was such a positive jump up in quality.  Limited camera work is not unforgivable. In 'Clerks', only the most basic camera movements are used and there is almost no style. It worked for that film because it was about people whose lives had no style, and it was consistent. Kevin Smith never let his reach exceed his grasp. 'The Blair Witch Project' caused some audiences to suffer motion sickness from the jerky hand-held stuff that put that pseudo-documentary together. When all was said and done, it was an effective work about the terror of getting lost and being consumed by a frightening situation. There is no sense of story or theme here on either a spoken or visual level. With this 'Fantastic Four', you never get more than an accidental laugh at the fact that the film makers and performers seem to be actually trying to rival other comic book movies with this poorly budgeted entry.   Any film involves a great deal of time and work. It just so sad that so much of both was poured into a project like this. If you're one of the people who were involved with this, it was most likely done as a stepping stone on the road of a (hopefully improved) film career. Everyone knows about taking jobs to make the most of what appears to be an opportunity. For those who are curious about watching this movie, my advice is to only do so with a group of friends (so you can all point and say \\\"you watched it, too\\\") who have been forewarned about the experience (so nobody gets hurt from the shock), and maybe you can come up with a drinking game to ease the pain between the accidental laughs.  1 out of 10\", \"I gave this a 2, and it only avoided a 1 because of the occasional unintentional laugh. The film is excruciatingly boring, and incredibly cheap. It's even worse if you know anything at all about the Fantastic Four.\", \"I am almost a two decade old human who's been reading comics most of my life. I'm not a huge fan of the Fantastic Four, but I'm fairly familiar with them. In 1994, Roger Corman (B-movie legend) produced the first, I think, feature length Fantastic Four film. The result was such pure schlock that it was never given a release. Still, copies exist, mostly on the net and at conventions. If you're looking for a laugh and can find a copy do yourself a favor and check this thing out.  The film basically retells the FF's origin and an encounter with Doctor Doom and a villain named The Jeweler, essentially the Mole Man with a penchant for petty larceny. As is the case with these comic book movies, everything has to tie into everything, so the FF play a vital role in Dr. Doom's creation, and he and the Jeweler play a vital role in theirs.  First, I'd just like to mention that despite everything that went bad in this movie, I actually sort of liked the guy that played Doom. He doesn't get many decent lines, but when he does he hits them. The armor looks pretty good too.  As for the rest...it's a dirty, dirty mess. Bad plots, bad acting, bad effects, bad everything basically. Boos especially to Jay Underwood, bringing new meaning to the word overacting as Johnny Storm. He's not overacting, he's ultracting.  As for the FF, well they all sort of look right, and Sue's played by a very attractive actress, but they just don't seem like a real team. For one thing they have no reason for Sue and Johnny to go into space. In an early section Ben and Reed go to visit the two, Johnny's like 8 and Sue's about 12. It only stands to make their eventual romantic pairing a helluva lot creepier. The Thing costume looks more reptilian than anything else, not very rocky, and the only time the Human Torch is really a Human Torch he looks like the Silver Surfer tinted red.  I could type for hours, but I think the scene that best sums it up is a climactic encounter featuring the aforementioned not-so-Human Torch. He's racing a laser beam, and he eventually destroys it with a punch. Yes, a punch. A laser beam. With a punch. Then he flies around and goes \\\"Yippeee!\\\" a whole lot, whereupon the camera tilts down and he flies back TOWARD EARTH. Evidently Reed the intellectual forgot to inform Johnny that fire doesn't exist in the vacuum of space. This and many other scenes operate like Looney Toones, if the character doesn't know they are over a cliff, they don't fall.  I laughed, I cried, I was glad it was never released.\", \"When HULK hit theaters in 2003, it wasn't long before DVDs of the old Incredible Hulk TV show popped up in an attempt to cash in on the craze. We saw a similar occurrence a year prior when Spider-Man cartoons appeared on DVD to coincide with that hero's big screen debut. Companies leap at the opportunity to ride on the financial coattails of a hot brand.  So the fact that this picture never surfaced on the shelves of Wal-Mart as its featured heroes clobbered the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot. I guess everyone involved would just rather forget. To be fair, THE FANTASTIC FOUR is not as bad as everyone says. Let me rephrase that. It's not as unentertaining as all of its negative reviews might suggest.  Veteran television actor Alex Hyde-White (no, you don't remember any of his roles) leads the way as Reed Richards, the brilliant scientist who, along with his crew, gains bizarre powers after an outer space mishap. He's left with the ability to stretch and contort his body to outrageous lengths. His future wife, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab), can suddenly turn invisible, while her brother, Johnny (Jay Underwood), may now ignite himself at will. Then there's poor Ben Grimm (Michael Bailey Smith), the lovable lug whose body morphs into a mass of craggy, orange rock.  Just as the friends are becoming accustomed to all of this, they are called upon to rescue the world from certain chaos. It seems Reed's old colleague Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) is living up to his name, and that villainous Jeweler (Ian Trigger) isn't exactly helping old ladies cross the street, either. Can our heroes save the day? Of course they can; like any superhero movie, it's just a question of how and when.  What's striking about THE FANTASTIC FOUR is how amateurish it is in virtually every aspect. The dialog is so lame and tired it sounds like it was written by a junior high drama class. The acting is so unpolished it makes a third-rate afternoon soap opera look like Shakespeare. The special effects are surprisingly good considering the minuscule budget, but there are still some positively embarrassing moments. When The Human Torch fully ignites his body, for instance, the entire movie briefly turns into a cartoon. I can just hear that production meeting. \\\"Oh, no one will notice. They'll be too intrigued by the action!\\\" I mean really, a cartoon? At least give me a mannequin on fire held up by a string! Prior to that, the scene in which the foursome come to on earth after their spaceship crashes is pure teens-in-the-backyard fare. The crew simply found a field and lit a vaguely-spaceship-like object on fire. That's the only remnant of such a major disaster?  Of course there wasn't a whole lot to work with in the script. There is a fairly coherent story here, but it's all so simplified. When Reed and Ben decide to go into outer space, they simply drop by the Storms' house and ask if they'd care to join them. Is it really that easy? Don't these sort of things require, oh, I don't know, years of training and expertise? Not in the world of these writers, who seemed to be inspired by the underrated genius on display in FULL HOUSE reruns. But as bad as that may be, nothing can compare to how painfully clich\\u00e9d Dr. Doom is. He was pulled right out of those awful superhero cartoons from the 1960s, right down to the evil laugh and slamming his clenched fist down on the table to punctuate his remarks. No comic book, least of all Fantastic Four, has ever featured a villain so obscenely one dimensional.  Ultimately, THE FANTASTIC FOUR is saved from being a complete turkey because it's just so damn innocent. You can tell the people involved, as little talent or experience as they had, really tried. They didn't know the final result would be so embarrassing. They were under the impression that this was their big break, that people would flock to the theaters. It bears repeating that they had virtually no money to work with (and I'm sure half of that was eaten up by the cool Thing costume). All things considered, they did well, and for its many flaws, the finished product is a fair amount of fun for comic book fans.\"], \"review_score\": [4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], \"review_category\": [\"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 2.0}, \"Fantastic Voyage\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0060397\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Fargo\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0116282\", \"total_review_count\": 2, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"I am sorry, it may be a 'work of art' as some have suggested here, but Fargo is the most BORING movie I have ever seen.

I've heard how this film is a \\\"black comedy\\\" by the Coen Brothers, who supposedly are geniuses in the film industry. And I've listened to friends discuss how creative and wonderful the film is. But none of this, I repeat, NONE OF THIS, is apparent in this movie. What I watched was a film confused at whether to be serious or comedic. And in making up its mind, both elements are fused together in a twisted fashion with an out-of-place Canadian humor.   Basically the story is about a car salesman who needs cash...fast, so he pays a couple of guys to kidnap his wife so that her rich father will pay the ransom, thereby getting him the cash he needs. Well, all goes to hell as the kidnappers end up on a killing spree with a cop questioning all possible leads, including the car salesman himself.  If in fact this film was based on a true story (as indicated at the beginning), I would be horrified if I were close to one of the victims. The Coen brothers make a strange mockery out of the deaths of the victims portrayed and deter the audience from taking the film seriously, instead giving them a quasi-mental hypothermia with the serious/humorous dichotomy. And even if this film is not based on a true story, it is so poorly directed that I just felt like I had wasted my time going around in circles. But yet I'll walk out my front door and everyone will still be applauding this satirical trash. Sigh.

Rambo: First Blood Part II was no exception to this. The only movies that Sylvester Stallone were in that were good were Rocky and First Blood. This film is extreamly unrealistic, and boring. It has action, but not very good action. I didn't enjoy watching it, and I would never ever watch this again. No wonder why it won the Razzie Award for Worst Picture. I would give this a 3/10, the only reason why it got the 3 was because it had somewhat good action, but not good enough.\", \"The summary pretty much sums it all up. This is nowhere near as good as the original. With a script co-written by both Stallone and James Cameron (at the same time he was also writing Aliens). Most of the action was written by Cameron and the political aspects were written by Stallone.  Sly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and Rocky 4 and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids, depending on your own viewpoint or opinion.  Rambo starts off in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a Presidential pardon. He eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by Charles Napier playing a Washington suit trying to pass himself off as former ex-forces to placate Rambo.  The mission is to find out if there are any missing POWs still alive in camps in Vietnam. Rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself. He is told it's not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos only.  After a bad attempt at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit, meets his contact (who turns out to be a cute woman) and travels down river with pirates to the camp.  He finds there are still prisoners and rescues one. As the 3 flee from half the Vietnamese Army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but Rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pick-up point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with Rambo almost on board.  Rambo is betrayed again and abandoned as Napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter. It is clear as Trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be found.  Steven Berkoff turns up as a Russian Spetznatz Colonel and Rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more Vietnamese troops and Spetznatz. Killing many of them, Rambo finally steals a chopper and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his base.  He resists the urge to kill Napier for abandoning him but destroys the Ops Centre.  A weak plot and very weak ending as Rambo walks off into the sunset as a free man.\", \"By rights, there should never have been a \\\"First Blood Part II\\\". The original script for \\\"First Blood\\\" had John Rambo committing suicide at the end of the film, but this was changed to allow him to live, not because the producers wanted to make a sequel but because test audiences found the original ending too depressing. Nevertheless, someone obviously thought that the character was too good to waste, because he ended up as the hero of two more films in the eighties, plus the recently released fourth instalment.  The official title of this film was \\\"Rambo: First Blood Part II\\\", but it is more commonly known simply as \\\"Rambo\\\". It starts with the title character in jail, where he is presumably expiating the crimes he committed in \\\"First Blood\\\", although this is never made too explicit. He is removed from prison by his former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman, for a secret mission. Rambo is to return to Vietnam to investigate reports that American POWs are still being held captive by the Communist regime. He is under strict instructions not to attempt to rescue any prisoners or to engage the enemy; his is to be simply a fact-finding mission.  What Rambo does not realise is that he is being set up, not by Trautman, who is portrayed as brave, honourable and incorruptible, but by the organiser of the mission, a military bureaucrat named Murdock. Murdock intends that the mission will prove that there are no American prisoners in Vietnam, partly because that will improve relationships between the American and Vietnamese governments, partly because it will make his own life easier. Unfortunately for Murdock, Rambo discovers that not only are Americans still being held prisoner, they are also being kept in hellish conditions. Of course, he is far too much of a hero to leave them to their fate, and tries to rescue them. The rest of the film is more or less one long battle between Rambo and a few allies (including a beautiful Vietnamese girl) and the evil commie soldiers and their Russian allies. Most of the evil commies, of course, end up dead, although I was surprised to learn from your \\\"trivia\\\" section that the total death toll was as low as 67. At times it seemed as though Rambo was trying to wipe out the entire Vietnamese army.  The tone of this film is very different from the first. In \\\"First Blood\\\" Rambo was unquestionably a criminal, even though his responsibility for his crimes was lessened by severe provocation and by his mental instability. In \\\"Rambo\\\" he is a bona fide all-American hero. A few years earlier the director, George Pan Cosmatos, had made \\\"The Cassandra Crossing\\\", a biased piece of left-wing anti-American propaganda. Cosmatos, however, was nothing if not versatile, and \\\"Rambo\\\" proves that he could also turn his hand to biased right-wing pro-American propaganda. The one thing the two films have in common is that both are laughably bad.  \\\"First Blood\\\" had its faults, but it also had its virtues. Its stance, that the anti-war movement was partly to blame for the problems faced by Vietnam vets in readjusting to civilian life, was a controversial one, but at least the film was trying to make a statement about war, social attitudes to war, and the roots of violence in society. \\\"Rambo\\\", by contrast, has very few virtues, except that the action sequences are well enough done to please those who like that sort of thing. It is essentially a sort of jingoistic revenge fantasy for those Americans who were still sore about the Vietnam war. Rambo re-fights the war single-handed, and this time the right side wins. Take that, Charlie Cong!   By this point, no doubt, the film's admirers (and there seem to be plenty- more than 2,000 voters have already given it ten stars) will have concluded that I am a liberal commie-loving pinko. Far from it- in fact, I have always despised Communism as a pernicious ideology. What I dislike about the film is not its politics but its lack of subtlety and its suggestion that the solution to all problems, including ideological disputes, is to go in with all guns blazing and to try and kill as many people as possible. It makes no attempt to understand the political complexities of South-East Asia or why not everyone in the region was pro-American. For all its anti-Communism, the film is the sort of moronic sledgehammer propaganda that the Communists were very good at churning out themselves- except that they attributed all the world's problems to Capitalism, or Imperialism, or Revisionism, or whatever other ism they had taken a dislike to. Compared to \\\"Rambo\\\", \\\"The Green Berets\\\" was a masterly piece of political analysis. 3/10\", \"I think it's time John Rambo move on with his life and try to put Vietnam behind him. This series is getting old and Rambo is no longer a solider but a cold blooded killer. Ever time he turns up on the screen someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly I am tired of Hollywood making it seem like it was. This is not the worst of the films concerning Vietnam, that honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets. In any case John Rambo carrying around a 50 cal Machine Gun taking on what seems to be half of the Viet Cong army plus a good many Russians is an insult to watch. What is worse is Rambos cheesy speech at the end...Please!! Oh yeah I heard they are making another one...\", \"The ghost of the Vietnam war has haunted the American psyche for thirty years now. If not because of the fact that tens of thousands of American soldiers went MIA in Vietnam, or the manner in which those who returned were treated, then because it was the first war that America could be said to have lost. Many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves, and the original First Blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world, as the saying goes. First Blood Part II, on the other hand, is little more than a fist-pumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore America can be, both in victory and defeat. Stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular Special Forces commando, while Richard Crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient. Where it all comes undone is in the script, which didn't do any better when it was called Missing In Action and starred Chuck Norris. What little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone, as the filmmakers decide to paint a big S on Rambo's massive chest.  The film picks up a little while after the end of First Blood. The film, that is - the novel didn't allow for the possibility of sequels. In this mediocre follow-up, Rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of open-air mine. As he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat, a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with Colonel Trautman, who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission. Rambo, never one to back down from a hard day's violent work, accepts, and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be Cambodia or Thailand (I forget which). From there, he is commissioned to seek out a camp where American MIAs are supposedly being held, and photograph them. His mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release. Rambo being Rambo, however, has other ideas in spite of their possible political implications.  Of course, things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning Rambo's work have more interest in making sure no American MIAs are found. It is the age-old conspiracy theory, and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an American family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official Vietnam war had been raging for. Of course, with the Jingoism that was inherent in American society during the 1980s, they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the Vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of Russians. Together, the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from Rambo, but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets, arrows, rockets, and destruction. About the only thing missing is the moment when Rambo drinks from a grail-like chalice and declares himself invincible.  To be honest, First Blood Part II is a well-photographed, and well-choreographed, action spectacle. The hand-to-hand combat with the larger Russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever. The rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for Americans to pump their fist to. Fortunately, this fad of America \\u00fcber alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as Platoon began doing the rounds. Some of the kills shown here are quite creative, despite all the problems. The Vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy. The Russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous. Only in a 1980s action film would one see a LAW being used from inside a helicopter. Sure, there have been action film clich\\u00e9s rooted in contradictions of fact, but never this ridiculous before.  I gave Rambo: First Blood Part II a one out of ten. It is so bad it is ridiculous, and so ridiculous that it is often funny. One doesn't even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are. The only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved. Keep the tongue firmly in the cheek, and it might be watchable.\", \"While the original First Blood had its far-fetched moments, it was at least exciting in parts. In Rambo: First Blood, Part II the emphasis is shifted very much onto comic-book action. Plausibility is totally rejected; logic nose-dives; Stallone becomes so impregnable that there can be no doubt he will succeed in his mission. Just like any other wish-fulfilment actioner of that time (e.g. Invasion USA, Commando, Red Scorpion), Rambo: First Blood, Part II cancels out its own opportunities for real excitement by presenting a hero too invulnerable to fear for. If you can tell from the word go that Rambo is going to wipe out hundreds of enemy soldiers, what is left to get excited about?  Imprisoned after the events of the first movie, John J Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is offered a pardon if he will join a covert operation in the Far East. The year is 1985, and a mission is being arranged to find out if there are any American PoWs still trapped in the jungles of Vietnam. Rambo is encouraged to take the job by his old mentor Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), but the assignment is actually the brainchild of a government outfit fronted by Marshall Murdock (Charles Napier). Rambo's job is merely to head for a prison camp in the jungle and check out if it contains any American PoWs \\u0096 if it doesn't, he is to rendezvous with a chopper; if it does, he is to get photographic evidence of their existence so that they can be rescued at a later date. Aiding him in his quest is a lady soldier with local knowledge, the beautiful and resourceful Co Bao (Julia Nickson). Sure enough, Rambo discovers that there are PoWs in the camp, but he exceeds his orders by rescuing one of them\\u0085 when he reaches the rendezvous point, the rescue chopper abandons him on the orders of Murdock who, it seems, doesn't really want to find any PoWs because of the political and military implications. Rambo is captured by the enemy and tortured, but following an explosive escape he sets out to free the PoWs and get his revenge on the treacherous Murdock.  The few good points of the film come from Jack Cardiff's polished photography, Jerry Goldsmith's exhilarating score, and the sheer professionalism of the stunt team in performing various action antics. Beyond these scant pickings, the film is a failure. The actors are reduced to macho posturing, the plot rings false, the action sequences are soulless and suspenseless, the dialogue is absurd\\u0085 even the violence becomes numbingly predictable. At the time of its release America was under the presidency of Ronald Reagan, a man with simplistic and near-hysterical anti-communist sentiments. For this reason, contemporary audiences lapped up this Commie-bashing shooting-fest as if it was the greatest movie of all-time, transforming it into an undeserved box office success. Thankfully times have changed \\u0096 nowadays we can look upon it as a simple-minded action flick with a ludicrously high body count, ludicrously dumb politics, and a ludicrous hero.\", \"I don't see much reason to get into this movie in much detail. Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo, author and survivor of \\\"A Season in Hell\\\", recruited from prison by his only friend, Major Richard Crenna, to secretly return to Vietnam, take photos of the American prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps, and return without engaging the enemy.  Fat chance. What if he actually DID nothing more than sneak in, take pics, and sneak out? Who would come to see the movie?   It's essentially a celebration of Stallone's muscles. Preparing for his mission, we see his well-oiled muscles bulging. (They are oiled and bulging throughout.) There is the ritual strapping on of black leather, ugly guns, and even uglier knives. The black guns are cleaned, assembled with loud clacks, and almost as oiled as Stallone's muscles. The bow is tested and, yes, it has enough poundage to drive a bolt through an enemy's forehead. The knife is sharpened with slick snicks.  Stallone and one of his POWs are betrayed by one or two of the suits from Washington, cynical politicians who, you can bet, were never even in a fist fight in grammar school. No guts, you know? Just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beer.  The movie does what it set out to do, but what it set out to do is meretricious. It deliberately cashes in on the myth popular in the mid-1980s that there were uncountable numbers of MIAs quietly kept in wretched camps by the North Vietnamese. The bumper stickers were ubiquitous. (Free Our MIAs.) Why would they keep them? It was never quite reasoned out but perhaps to turn the POWs into a slave labor force -- in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor. Or maybe for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the United States -- a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese kept secret from the world.  As a captive, Rambo is treated in a Medieval fashion by the North Vietnamese. Dipped to his neck in pig excrement and then hauled out of it by his wrists, his muscles still on display. Then, not content with subhuman Vietnamese, a Russian officer is brought in to play the part of the Gestapo officer -- \\\"Vee haff vays of MAKING you remember.\\\" A high-tech type, the Russian uses psychology and electricity, not just pig dump.  Rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until \\\"this country loves us as much as we love it,\\\" bringing up another myth that Vets returning from Vietnam were uniformly spat upon and cursed, which is why I guess we elected so many to the Congress and appointed others to high-echelon positions. The last three losing presidential candidates were among that despised group. At least Rambo's aimless drifting left room open for a sequel, which arrived apace.  The action movies with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but Rambo is humorless. It marches dully through it's phantasmal ideological swamp, killing without mercy, barely speaking, barely able to speak. To speak is a sign of weakness.\", \"I remember I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, had a Commodore 64 and loved to play Rambo on it. I was therefore really thrilled when I got to buy this movie really cheap. I put it in my VCR and started up: Man this movie is really bad! Sylvester Stallone says like 3 words in the entire movie (except for that awful sentimental speech at the end), and has the same expression on his face all the way. And that stupid love thing in the middle, it's just so amazingly predictable. I just ended up fast forwarding the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else.\", \"As an Army veteran, I was deeply offended by this film. In my opinion, it is a disgrace to those who fought in the Vietnam war. To say that the real SF soldiers I knew were offended by this crap is an understatement. If the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon (it was), it would have been better received. But it was taken seriously my many people, especially overseas. Silly as it sounds, wherever I went in Europe in the late 80's people seemed to judge me and Americans in general by this film. Unrealistic? Hmm, let's see. A monosyllabic, muscle-bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to SE Asia to free some American POW's. In a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats. And he never misses, running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm. I could go on, but I'm getting a headache. I gave this a 2/10 only because it's slightly better than Rambo III.\", \"Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay. And, while I would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to, I couldn't resist a free trip to the movies! That's how I came to see crap like the second Conan movie and NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN! Now, despite this being a wretched movie, it is in places entertaining to watch--in a brain dead sort of way. And, technically the stunts and camera-work are good, so this elevates my rating all the way to a 2! So why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike the first Rambo movie, this one has virtually no plot, Rambo himself only says about 3 words (other than grunts and yells), there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped \\\"romance\\\" and the movie is one giant (and stupid) special effect. And what STUPIFYINGLY AWFUL special effects. While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at Rambo, none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo shoots hits its mark! And, while the bad guys are using AK-47s, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes all Rambo had is a bow and arrows with what seem like nuclear-powered tips!! The scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers! It was wonderfully parodied in UHF starring Weird Al. Plus, HOT SHOTS, PART DEUX also does a funny parody of the genre--not just this stupid scene.  All-in-all, a movie so dumb and pointless, it's almost like self-parody!\", \"This movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies Stallone ever made. This is a typical 80s movie where you have one man destroying the whole army by himself. \\\"First Blood Pt. 2\\\" is very similar to Schwarzenegger's \\\"Commando\\\", but there you have Arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation showed as the bad guys. This movie is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. True, this was the peak of the Cold War, but I'm sick of having Communists or the Nazis always being shown as the enemy. There are so many American movies that have this one thing in common. Why can't there a movie that show Americans as the enemy? Who's going to believe that one lone soldier will destroy the whole army? Do you really think that something like this would have really happened? By the looks of it, an average, brain washed American viewer certainly would.\", \"George P. Cosmatos' \\\"Rambo: First Blood Part II\\\" is pure wish-fulfillment. The United States clearly didn't win the war in Vietnam. They caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh-so innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation, who made this war happen. The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this. He is extremely patriotic, bemoans that US-Americans didn't appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier, but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians. Like every film that defends the war (e.g. \\\"We Were Soldiers\\\") also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in South Asia. And for that matter also the reason for every single US-American soldier that was there. Instead, Rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation. It would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories, rather than suppressing them. \\\"Do we get to win this time?\\\" Yes, you do.\", \"An offensively over-the-top action adventure,FIRST BLOOD PART II seemed to catch the mood of the US at the time of it's release in the mid-80's,with right-wing Reaganism and virulent anti-red feelings still not finished yet,though the emergence of a certain Mikhail Gorbachev in the heart of the 'Evil Empire' in Moscow would soon render these types of films redundant;even Reagan himself eventually admitted this truism.  In that sense,we can be most grateful to 'Gorby',not for his disarmament treaties with the US,nor his policies of 'glasnost',or even his support of democracy being restored to the Eastern European countries in the former Soviet Union's backyard.No,it's the final diminution of foolish,jingoistic,bloated cold-war adventures like this.The first RAMBO film was hardly perfect,though at least was a mildly literate and adequate action thriller with a not too bad storyline.In this sequel,any sense of even the remotest conviction is instantly jettisoned for silly,senseless plotting and incident in which Rambo single-handedly takes on scores of brainlessly stereotyped Vietnamese and Russian troops to rescue American POW's ten years after the conflict ended,with the Americans on the losing side.  Perhaps the reason why the film was a huge box-office success was to let many Americans wallow in fantasy;they may have lost the war,but there was still unfinished business at hand,and ludicrous comic-strip heroics with a robot-like hero killing virtually every red on sight,with as much hardware as possible,fulfilled such whimsically far-fetched ideals.  This could have been entertaining on a SUPERMAN/SPIDERMAN level,but sadly everything is played absolutely straight.But that is not to say that there is no humour in the film;sadly it is virtually all of the unintentional kind.The action scenes,though technically adequate,never once carry the slightest bit of conviction or persuasiveness,because they are always placed in the most spectacularly unbelievable of contexts;namely,our hero Rambo is always unscathed (aside from a few cuts and bruises here and there) despite the tons of explosives,grenades,gunshots,etc.going around him.  In between the mayhem,what there is of a script consists of the dullest clich\\u00e9s and banalities.Stallone,who co-wrote the script with James Cameron (a long way from the exciting TERMINATOR made the previous year),deliberately seems to have given the Rambo character as little to say in understandable English,and merely comes out with moronic grunts,almost as though he has invented his own brand of patois only understandable to himself.Maybe his colleague Cameron was thinking of The Terminator again with so little communication involved for the lead character! In this sense Rambo seems even less of a human than the Terminator did! The rest of the cast do little better with good actors like Charles Napier and Richard Crenna doing their admirable best with the hackneyed dialogue they are given,and Steven Berkoff hamming it up outrageously yet again with another of his Russian KGB/Red Army villain roles.Berkoff's overplaying is mildly enjoyable but not remotely menacing.How come that Sly managed to survive Berkoff's electric shock torture to kill yet more of those Red Commie scumbags? Well,credibility is never this film's strong point.It is a work of fantasy comparable with THE WIZARD OF OZ.At least that WAS meant to be a fantasy,and an immortal classic it turned out to be.This is only a classic of the most dismal,and indeed offensive,kind.And as for Sly's climactic speech...,rather hypocritical after slaughtering all those people,eh? By the way,in the same year,he also made ROCKY IV..........  RATING:3 out of 10.\", \"Like 'First Blood', this attempts to make a point about the treatment of Vietnam vets, but there really isn't much time for that in between the monotonous gunfire, burnings, stabbings, torture and explosions as an impossibly indestructible Rambo takes out half of Asia, a ton of Vietnamese soldiers, most of the Russian army, various vehicles and anything else he can point a rocket launcher at. The only woman in the middle of all these boys toys is soon bumped off, allowing the testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script to degenerate into a succession of loud noises. Helpfully supplying a few hackneyed musical cues is Jerry Goldsmith, who carefully checks off all the clich\\u00e9d themes from Russian rat-a-tat to Chinese ching-chang-chong just in case we don't quite understand who we're looking at. Stallone has a brain in his head; this empty nonsense is beneath him.\"], \"review_score\": [1, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4], \"review_category\": [\"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 2.3333333333333335}, \"The Fisher King\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0101889\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Five Easy Pieces\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0065724\", \"total_review_count\": 5, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"This movie is a prime example of people being too messed up from the 1960s after taking too much LSD. People are reading way too much into this movie. If this movie was made today it would be panned and dismissed. It is boring beyond belief. You keep waiting for something to occur. Nothing ever does. By the time it ends you are thinking I'm going to kill myself if I have to endure another minute. The acting of Nicholson and Black is above average but you wonder what they saw in choosing to do this horrible script. The comment that this is one of the key films of the 1970s is ludicrous. These are the kind of movies from the 70s that should be forgotten. Give me \\\"Apocalypse Now\\\", \\\"Patton\\\", \\\"Godfather\\\", \\\"American Graffiti\\\" or \\\"Star Wars\\\". This movie sucks. One great scene does not a movie make.\", \"Of all the character study movies, most of them are boring. However, Bob Rafelson's \\\"Five easy pieces\\\" was, in my opinion, the most boring of all. In fact, I didn't really see what he was getting at. All I saw was Jack Nicholson playing an extremely depressed man, Karen Black dressed up to be made to sexy as his dumb girlfriend and then there was the rest of the cast. The only good element in this movie is the timeless diner scene which shows just how good an actor Nicholson is. But otherwise, I think it's more of a biography of about a year in a man's life than a character study. I truly and honestly don't think it's worth a watch unless you're a huge Jack Nicholson fan and even if you are, you should watch simply to see the hilarious diner scene.\", \"This was a hard movie to watch and I would not recommend it to anyone that I know. I'm all for character studies, even of characters that are in one way or another hard to like. Amadeus comes to mind, as does American Splendor. The Lion In Winter is a character study of sorts, of the whole messed up royal family that movie portrays. TV's house is sort of a character study. But those examples had something that this movie did not. Depth.  Curmudgeons, jerks, petty people, you really don't have to like the main character to find a movie engaging. That being said, the main character in Five Easy Pieces was one I thoroughly did not like. Yes, he was a loner, but why? How did it initially come about? Hard as it was to watch him be such a jerk to his girl, she was probably ideal for him, since she let him treat her poorly, run off when he needed to, he screwed up- she apologized. Not my ideal, but it worked for them.  So? Still, I'm left cold as a viewer, wondering why anyone cares. And yes he can play piano. But he doesn't live the piano man's life and I guess there is supposed to be some conflict, but many people have talents they don't take to the next level, etc.  This movie was nothing special, if you ask me, other than a highly recommended and lengthy waste of time.\", \"Those who praise Five Easy Pieces call it a great character study. Maybe it is, but that doesn't make it a great movie. The character of Robert Dupea may have made for a nice subject for an article in a psychology journal. But as the lead character in a film he leaves a lot to be desired. Not even the fact that Dupea is played by the great Jack Nicholson can mask the truth that the movie which tells his story is downright dull. Yeah, there's a pretty interesting story in here somewhere but the way that story unfolds on the screen leaves a lot to be desired.  The biggest problem with this movie is quite simply that nothing happens. We are just forced to sit and watch as Robert Dupea tries to \\\"find himself\\\". While Dupea's finding himself you'll probably be stifling yawns. The fact that the lead character we're following is an irredeemable louse doesn't help matters either. Robert Dupea treats all those around him, most notably his ever-loyal girlfriend, like absolute garbage. He's completely full of himself, which is rather odd for someone working a menial job on an oil rig. Where does this guy get off being so high and mighty? Who the heck is he to think he's so much better than those around him? About halfway through the film we see where that attitude comes from as Dupea goes on a journey back to his childhood home to reconnect with the person he truly is or at least used to be. This is where all that \\\"great character study\\\" malarkey kicks in. Yes, it turns out Robert Dupea isn't exactly what he initially seems to be. Yes, he's a very complex character. But he's still at heart an awful human being. And this is still a boring movie.  Jack Nicholson is certainly one of our finest actors and he does the best he can here but this film just isn't salvageable. The character Nicholson plays is impossible to root for. You end up sympathizing with everyone in the movie but him, a problem since the movie is really about him alone. For the first half of the movie absolutely nothing happens as the filmmakers go out of their way to establish what a mean-spirited jerk Dupea is. Actually that was established in the first five minutes but they belabor the point to tedious effect. Then the great journey home begins and the movie for a few minutes veers off into Bizarro World when Dupea picks up a pair of hippie, lesbian hitchhikers. One of these hitchhikers, named Palm Apodaca which tells you about all you need to know, launches into one of the most bizarre, comical rants in film history. Only she's not trying to be funny, she's deadly serious. If nothing else, at least you the viewer can laugh at the sheer stupidity of it all, which is about all the enjoyment you'll get out of this film. Soon enough Palm and friend are gone and we're back to focusing on Robert Dupea. Who's still a selfish, obnoxious, jerk stuck in an utterly boring movie. A great character study? You can judge that for yourself. A great movie? Absolutely not.\", \"In this movie Bobby (Jack Nicholson) is a definition loner. Loner is defined as one who avoids the company of other people and this is definitely Bobby. To begin with Bobby has no love for anything or anybody. He ignores his family, hates his job, and most of all he doesn't care about his girlfriend at all. He expects everyone to give him love back but he gives none out. Catherine points this out to him when he asks her to show him some love.  The start of Bobby being a loner is his family. He left them for no apparent reason and started jumping around from place to place. He had a promising career as a piano player because he was good at it and it was his family heritage. He just threw this away along to work on an oil rig which he hates also and ends up quitting. He didn't tell them where he was going or what he was doing so they had no idea what he was up to until the day he went and saw his sister. The only reason he went back to see his family is because his father was dieing and he felt that he was obligated to do so. I don't think that he actually wanted to be there he just felt he should be.  The next biggest thing in his life besides his family is his girlfriend who he shows absolutely no respect to. He is constantly cheating on her and bad mouthing her right to her face. She wants the relationship to get more serious by having kids and he wants nothing to do with that because he doesn't want to be tied down. The only reason that they are still together is because she is to stupid and na\\u00efve to break up with him. Every time she wants to do it he says something a little sweet and she instantly forgives him and lets him walk all over her again. To be honest this is the perfect girl for Bobby because he can do what ever he wants and she will let him.  You can also tell Bobby is a loner because every time something big happens he goes off by himself and gets drunk. For example when things go bad at his house he leaves and goes and gets drunk in a bar. When Bobby and Elton go to work drunk one morning and the boss doesn't let them work they leave and start drinking more. While stuck in traffic Bobby gets out of the car and gets in the back on a truck with a piano and starts playing, then the truck leaves and Elton loses him. This is a great symbol to show that Bobby is a loner because the only person he likes in his life is Elton and he is taken away from him by the truck. Then days later Elton is really taken from him when he is arrested so Bobby is totally alone.  We find out at the end of the movie that Bobby is a loner because he is afraid that things will get bad if he stays in one spot for too long. With this mentality that Bobby has it is no wonder he is a loner and why he will always be a loner. He doesn't want to get attached and he expects that people will do everything for him.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Five Feet High and Rising\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0240507\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Fletch\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0089155\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Adventures of Ford Fairlane\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0098987\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The French Connection\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0067116\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Frequency\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0186151\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"This was an awesome movie and it is highly recommended from me. Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel are outstanding in their roles as father and son. The story is this. When John (Caviezel) finds his dad's old ham radio in a closet he plugs it in not really caring about it. But when he starts talking to a guy who he dosen't know he becomes interested in him and minutes later discovers that he is talking to his dad, who has been dead for thirty years. He starts to try to convince his dad that it is him, his 36 year old son, but the dad does not believe him. The son suddenly discovers that he is talking to his dad 2 days before he dies! He tries to save him and talks to him about not trusting his instincs but suddenly loses contact and does not know if his dad had heard what he said. Plenty of twists and turns in this story to keep you into it. Quaid and Caviezel give powerful performances and the movie is facinating and awesome. Great idea from the director. One of the best movies I've ever seen!  **** out of ****\", \"This is a really a beautiful and touching movie. Many others and I have given many praises to this movie. But its popularity and IMDB rating at 7.5 are quite a surprise to us.  As many of you can only watch it on DVD/VHS now, let me give you an info. I watched it the first time in the cinema and the following 5 or more times on DVD. When I watched it in the cinema, near the end of the movie when John Sullivan Sr reappeared, ALL THE AUDIENCES IN THE CINEMA cheered and applauded. I mean ALL THE AUDIENCES. Really, no kidding!!! It touched the entire crowd. Very emotional and uplifting. I have gone to cinemas for lots of movies, but rarely did I see any effect like this. Based on such audience response, who could doubt about how good this movie is?  Yes, its story line is not 100% logical. But if such measuring stick is applied to ALL MOVIES, I wonder which one can pass and be considered good!  Frequency, I highly recommend it, to be watched and to be owned!!!\", \"I've never heard of this movie on tv or anywhere. I've seen the name somewhere on internet (p2p...) and I've checked here on imdb to know more about it, it sounded interesting. Now I've seen it and I put this movie in the top 3 of all movies I've ever seen ! It's amazing, from the start to the end you'll never get your eyes off of the screen. The actors are wonderful, there's really nothing bad to say about this movie. Go buy/rent it it's fabulous !  \", \"Ok, i'm not going to wreck the movie for those of you who haven't seen it, but Frequency had to be one of the best Sci-Fi/Mystery ones I have seen in a long time. The movie is well acted by Dennis Quaid & Jim Caviezel who are stuck in 1969 & 1999 respectively, we see John (Caviezel), a NYPD Homicide officer who is still traumatized by the death of his dad (Quaid), a heroic firefighter. After coming across his HAM radio, he decides to plug it in, and comes across his dad, John manages to rescue him but with serious consequences. The film also boasts actual history events from the 1969 World Series and a finish which will surprise you, it's a movie that you really have to pay close attention to, but it's worth the lenght of the time duration, overall this film gets a 9 out of 10\", \"This movie did more to explain, use, and get characters out of, time travel paradoxes then anything I have ever seen on the screen. This movie BLEW ME AWAY with how it handled what had seemed like a goofy premise when the flick had come out. I have now watched it from beginning to end on three occasions, and it continues to blow me away. The casting of the father and son in 1969 and the present day are great, and watching the son unfold with every change in the past is wonderful. Why this movie didn't even get nominated for a Hugo Award (the awards given by the World SF convention each year) amazes me- it should have won the award.\", \"I just watched this one again. Damn it's good. A lot of people seem to have problems with possible plot errors, but I really wish they would look past those and see a great movie. When I saw this one in theaters I was so excited that my heart was racing. This movie really has just about everything. And the Garth Brooks song at the end is a nice finishing touch.\", \"A word of warning: don't get caught up in the quest for an explanation about how a man could possibly speak to his father in the past. Obviously this kind of exchange is impossible so take my advice and don't worry about it, just watch the movie and enjoy it at face value, you won't be disappointed.\", \"I had never seen any trailers or read any reviews of 'Frequency' so when it was there to be watched on a Saturday evening on a satellite movie channel, the synopsis sounded interesting so I settled down to watch 'another movie'.  Boy, did I get a surprise. My wife was working in the other room and half way through the film came in to see why I was standing up shouting at the screen! \\\"SATCH! LOOK AT THE BASEBALL GAME ON THE TV FOR THE SHOE POLISH BALL... NOW!!\\\", I shouted! I have never got so wrapped up in a film before that has caused me to react in such a way.  A month later it was repeated and my wife and eldest child sat and watched it with me to see what all the fuss was about. Like I had been (and was again) they were completely engrossed and openly declared 'frequency' to be a massive hit and 'one of the best they had ever seen'.  After scanning some reviews on IMDB I cannot understand what some people expect from a movie. If I want to be factually informed, I watch a documentary or read a book. If I want to want to watch something that accurately reflects reality, I watch a 'fly on the wall', or read a biography. If I want to be entertained, I watch a movie. One thing for sure is that 'Frequency' entertained me thoroughly and moved me too and, unlike the grizzlers of this world, I am not ashamed to say it.  It has suspense, emotion, plot twists, characters you like and an enjoyable ending. What more could you ask for. Its a sad reflection on our society that some people actually wanted a different ending.  Its an excellent movie that will be in my DVD collection by lunchtime Monday. Amongst my top three ever, I will watch it again and again.\", \"This is a simply brilliant movie. It had me interested from beginning to end, mostly on the edge of my seat. I couldn't guess what was going to happen next, I loved the story and all its twists and turns, and the ending didn't let me down. I will be watching this one again.\", \"I occasionally get sick of romantic comedies, but the other kind of chick flick--namely, the kind having to do with that pure, gushy family love--I just can't get enough of. Plus, they managed to weave this one into a suspense/thriller, and threw in another one of my favorite fictional concepts for good measure: time travel, in this film represented by the parallel dimension through which a son speaks to his father before his death 30 years ago.  In fact, anyone who loves \\\"Back to the Future\\\" for the same reasons I do will gobble up the brain candy in \\\"Frequency.\\\" The ways in which the film deals with the thought-provoking concept of changing the past, while certainly blasphemous to the field of physics, sparks some interesting conversation after the credits.   The eerie curlicues of smoky clouds shown in the sky at various intervals attest to the fact that the makers of \\\"Frequency\\\" do not pretend to have a logical explanation for how two men can be using the same radio at the same desk in the same house to be speaking to each other over a distance of 30 years.   I was so captivated by the secondary plot, an old unsolved murder case that quickly becomes personal when father and son play G-d, that I didn't have a chance to care about the unidimensionality of most of the characters, the flavorless dialogue or the predictability of the action. My jetlagged eyes were glued to the poor reception I have for a screen for the duration of the film.   Retrospectively, it was no piece of art! I can safely say that movies like this are much better while you're watching them, but what are movies for? This one was great.\", \"i personally love this movie. it's one of those movies that you wouldn't really think of watching it on the theater. but when it gets shown on HBO, it is considered as a rare find. Frequency is a more serious combination on Back to the Future :) it's all too impossible to happen, but the movie made you feel that it COULD happen.  there's a lot of emotional moments here and there, but there's also a mix of suspense which is surprisingly just right. this a great film, if there are flaws, i didn't bother listing it because the story itself shines. great actors too.\", \"I have to admit that Frequency surpassed my expectations. I was skeptical at first but the plot drew me in and held me until the end. Although it tries to straddle several genres, as it progresses it eventually boils down to a mystery/crime thriller.  Nevertheless, I do dock some points from Frequency. At times it was a little too cheesey. Most of the 60's props looked more 90's to me. I hardly noticed a difference at all between the two eras. Maybe I'm too young to tell?  The whole time-travel paradox was handled a bit sloppily, but really no worse than most time-travel movies. On the other hand, it was probably a good thing that the movie didn't get bogged down trying to explain the physics behind the radio time-connection or the details of the time-paradox.   Rather they simply established that this radio communicates through time. It's something to do with the stars; leave it at that. If they tried to offer some lame, detailed explanation, it would have hurt the credibility more. Overly picky critics may think themselves clever in pointing out the time-travel flaws in Frequency, but these are slips that the writers obviously knew about; it's assumed that the viewer will take a leap of faith fairly early on, and thus the movie is able to build an interesting plot from the premise of a \\\"magic\\\" radio.  Consider on the other hand, the latest Star Wars flicks, where Lucas tries to explain the Force coming from tiny organisms in the bloodstream. Bleeehh. What a way to kill the magic and distract from the plot.  All in all, Frequency is a fresh movie with an engrossing plot. I give it a 7 / 10.\", \"Spacey, soon-to-be-divorced cop John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) is toying with his deceased fathers old HAM radio one night, when, through some odd twist of fate so common in sci-fi films, he contacts his father Frank (Dennis Quaid) 30 years in the past.  Hold on, it gets much better.  Frank, who is a firefighter, died in a flaming building when John was 6. So, John helps him change the past so he doesn't die. There's one problem - now John's mother has been murdered by a killer John has been tracking in the present day. They must now race against time 30 years apart to stop this killer before he can kill John's mother/Frank's wife, and several other women.  A lot of people think this sounds cheesy, but this is actually one of the best film's of the early 21st century. The film is plot driven, and what a good plot it is. I couldn't say any more without spoiling it. Quaid is great, as is Caviezel. Some people thought he slept-walked through the movie, but that actually seemed right for the character. Honorable mention to Andre Braugher. I've never seen him turn in even an average performance.\", \"I love this movie! I watched it for the first time a few days ago and I must say, my breath was taken away by it. I'm not really big into sci-fis or anything like that, but this movie was excellent. It has Sci-Fi, action, drama, thriller, suspense written all over it, all bundled into one great feel-good movie of the decade. One of my new all time favorites. Get it today!\", \"As an EMT/Firefighter and an embracer of public safety - of course I'm going to love this movie because it involves my favorite things. A firefighter, a cop, father & son - a little realm of the outer edge with suspense building throughout - how could it not be a hit? This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and requires you to pay attention to the details so you can grasp the concept. Once your in their world, it's an amazing trip that kept me guessing all the way to the end. It is my all time favorite movie! And I recommend it to everyone!\", \"Didn't see this in the theater, but a coworker told me about it. Wound up buying it on DVD & watching it with my girlfriend and buddy. One of the best movies of its kind! The plot was very good, and flowed well. The action was believable. Many questions undoubtedly, but we have not been able to prove what an actual time shift act would result in. Definitely a movie to keep you on the edge of your seat, and when the timelines converge at the end, it was a total surprise and brought the end in just like a story should!  Very few other movies top this... and i am eager for this writer to write something else with this kind of creativity!\", \"OK. I give this a great rating partly because it really hits a lot of areas that I, personally, enjoy. The emotional focus is on the father-son relationship, and the idea of being able to contact your deceased parent. That alone would make me at least interested in  the movie. It also deals with \\\"the space/time continuum\\\" idea not all too far removed from \\\"Back to the Future\\\", but certainly not in  a comedy sense. These types of movies are a guilty pleasure. It  also manages to weave in a semi-interesting murder mystery. The fact that there is the backdrop of the 1969 World Series is just an added treat for a baseball junkie, such as myself. It's sort of a \\\"Field of Dreams\\\" meets \\\"Back to the Future\\\" with a side of murder mystery. All in all, I really enjoyed it. I have watched it again, now that it's  on video, and it holds up to multiple viewings. It will probably be one of those movies that I watch periodically to make me feel better.  Anyway, I'm not going to give any plot lines or rave about the performances (they were all fine). The true value of the movie came from the story and the direction. Just watch the movie, I doubt you'll be disappointed.\", \"This film is about John Sullivan who can communicate to his dad, Frank Sullivan, 30 years in the past. Having manage to save his dad's life, the two must fix all the bad things that have resulted from the saving of Frank.  This is a good sci-fi thriller that is like a father and son movie. Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel's performances are great, including others.  I like how the time effects used in this film in which two people in two different time periods (reminds me of The Lake House), changing things in the past which changes the present and creating more problems.  This film has mystery, action, thrills, and emotion between the father and son. It has great performances and is a good sci-fi thriller. If you like these kinds of films, watch it.\", \"There are not enough movies that you can leave feeling touched, refreshed, and enlightened. So many films today don't bother to build strong characters that have a lasting effect. Frequency is such a wonderful movie because it incorporates a realistic father-son bond, and raw emotion into an action thriller. I must admit that I am not particularly drawn to action movies, but after seeing Frequency I have tried to change my attitude.  Jim Caviezel and Dennis Quaid are extremely believable as a son and his long-dead father. Caviezel's character cried when he first talked to his father that had been dead for thirty years. I cried, too, as he so believably yearned to be with his dad.  Another great thing about this movie is how intriguing the action sequences are. Not only are the usual chase scenes exciting, but the interesting psychological aspects of the movie also work extremely well.  If you have not seen Frequency, please do so, it is an excellent movie and I doubt you will regret seeing it. Although seeing it in a theater is the ideal place, the DVD is almost the same. You should enjoy this movie, it is a true classic, and I know I will never tire of watching it.\", \"There are five movies which i consider really great: Contact, Apollo 13, Gataca, The Matrix, and this movie Frequency. It really should have gotten an oscar. Too bad it was so overlooked.  To sum it up, it's a sci-fi time travel murder mystery, so it gets the best of three genres! it also involves ham radio, an aspect not usually shown in movies. Now I may be biased since I myself am a ham, but I am very glad to see this fun hobby portrayed in a movie.  So the sunspot radio-wave time travel scheme is probably not adherent to your college physics book, but who cares? movies that mess with the space-time continuum are rarely this entertaining. if you suspend your disbelief, this is just one great story! It is action-packed and full of surprises but also emotional and touching.  The fire scenes are very well done and the film keeps you on the edge of your seat right up to the shocking conclusion. If you are headed to the video store tonight, I would strongly recommend Frequency. -Rox\", \"I waited to add my two cents until I had seen this film several times to see if the overwhelmingly positive effect would wear off. I am pleased to report that it doesn't. Remarkably, the effect gets stronger with each exposure. This is without a doubt my favorite recent film. The performances are wonderful. This is Quaid's best after his early bloom and nothing he's done since can compare with it. Jim C, well, he is luminous. Indeed, every role is well and truly played. This one is special because it does what the Fountain and a number of other, recent \\\"high concept\\\" and \\\"message\\\" films try but usually fail to accomplish in any meaningful fashion. Frequency moves the heart through the experience of film. It teaches love and does so without relying on the tension of plot because as I discovered, it still works after ten viewings when the end is not in doubt and \\\"what happens next\\\" isn't why your eyes are fixed on the screen. The reason you watch yet again, still eager, is simple. It is because,well, because, there is never, never enough love and this is a way to find a bit more, every time.\", \"I love this movie. It is a smart, sweet, suspenseful story. I've always loved time-travel stories. This one doesn't have classic time-travel, but it's similar in that there is the ability for father (in 1969) and son (present-day) to communicate and effect change in the future. It's a strong story with twists and turns as the son tries to save his father's life (in 1969) and accidentally messes up things in the present day.  When I first rented the movie, I had never seen the trailer. I am very glad, because the trailer gives away a big plot twist, which occurs halfway into the movie and I think it is more exciting if you don't see that coming (so I won't elaborate on that part).  This movie has authentic characters that I really cared about, which makes the suspense so much more real because I felt invested in what was going to happen to them. The strong directing and cinematography (atmospheric) ties this story together into the perfect package.  I also loved the small hints and moments that are sprinkled throughout the film that tie back into the larger \\\"time travel-ish\\\" story, which makes it great on repeat viewings. I thought the moments of how the past affected the future were all plausible except for one moment toward the very end of the film, which was clearly done for dramatic effect, (so I'll let it go).  Overall, one of my favorite movies!\", \"FREQUENCY / (2000) ***1/2  It' 1999. Jim Caviezel stars as John Sullivan, a detective whose life is falling apart. Recently, he has split up from his girlfriend, he and his police partner Satch (Andre Braugher), are unable to solve a serial murder case that has been reopened due to the discovery of skeletal remains of a past victim. The thirty year anniversary of the death of his firefighter father (Dennis Quaid), is also approaching. John is beginning to sink in a pit of despair.  One night John stumbles upon his dad's old ham radio. He makes an effort to get the machine to power up once again. When he does and begins conversations with another operator, however, he realizes the person he is communicating with is his long dead father. Somehow, due to the presence of the Northern Lights, John is able to transmit back in time to 1969 and literally alter the course of his existence.   The concept of time traveling communication may seem far-fetched to some, and \\\"Frequency\\\" is a little hard to grasp at times, especially when the film never directly explains why the father and son are able to talk with each other through time. Notwithstanding, the production works as a science fiction thriller with supernatural overtones. While the filmmakers do succeed in convincingly constructing \\\"Frequency,\\\" most audiences might have to leave logic at the theater entrance before viewing it.  \\\"Frequency\\\" is a well-structured motion picture; the movie is focused throughout. Although its story changes pace at different periods, for the most part the audience can follow along with the characters. This is a movie with a complicated and challenging story. Because of the film's complexity, we are enormously involved, if slightly confused. Screenwriter Tobias Emmerich links original and fresh feeling material here. Gregory Hoblit produces the right amount of action and suspense, combined with gentle emotions, to generate a film we have not seen before.   Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel are the perfect choices for the principal characters. Quaid performs with intriguing tension and appropriate receptivity. Caviezel dazzles with intricacy and dexterity. Offering refined supporting roles are Andre Braugher (\\\"City of Angels\\\", \\\"Get on the Bus\\\") and Noah Emmerich (\\\"The Truman Show\\\") who furnishes some light-hearted material as John's best friend.   Director Gregory Hoblit (\\\"Fallen,\\\" \\\"Primal Fear\\\") clearly executes topics on screen. This film is overflowing with ideas and contains enough plot for a television series. However, \\\"Frequency\\\" is not without flaws. Sullivan's chaotic life is only vaguely portrayed. Although we do care for the character, more development would increase the relationship between the audience and he. Some of the make-up effects depicting age differences were disgraceful. Andre Braugher appeared as if his make up artists were straight out of junior high, slapping too much pancake cream plaster on him. The film's contrived climax concludes with a formalistic fight instead of continuing its battle of wits.   Despite a few unacceptable external problems, internally this is a very effective production. As a whole, \\\"Frequency\\\" contains a very encompassing story and places interesting characters in engaging circumstances. The movie is definitely worthy of recognition, but do not view it unless you plan on thoroughly discussing it afterwards.\", \"This unique and interesting film is actually more of a suspense thriller than a science fiction, although I think fans of both genres will be pleased.  Dennis Quaid plays a heroic firefighter who was killed trying to rescue a runaway from a burning warehouse during the days of the Amazing Mets' World Series victory in October 1969. Jim Caviezel (\\\"The Thin Red Line\\\") plays his son, now a cop, thirty years later. Through some quirk of physics involving abnormal solar activity and the Aurora Borealis, the two make contact with each other across the 30-year span over a ham radio. The son is able to prevent his father's death, but changing the past also turns out to have unexpected consequences with which the two must deal.  The film really works on all levels with good action sequences and suspense, a nice dose of humor and some very touching exchanges between father and son. It explores the \\\"what if\\\" scenario of one's being presented with the opportunity to change an event in the past and the way in which those affected must deal with the consequences in a very intelligent and thought-provoking manner.  The acting is uniformly strong, with Quaid very appealing as the courageous firefighter and loving father who has an almost-childlike love for baseball (he even pulls off a Brooklyn accent nicely!); Caviezel is equally good as the present day version of Quaid's character's son. Caviezel brings a subtle sadness to the character, a quality one might expect from someone whose life hasn't quite worked out quite as well as it might have, possibly due to a void created by the absence of his father. One of the strongest aspects of Caviezel's performance was a subtle shift in personality following the changing of events in the past (a change which left him with memories both of his father's death and of time spent with his father in the intervening years).  I have a good feeling about this film and think it has a chance to be a real surprise hit. It's certainly one of the best films of the year thus far.\", \"The idea of this film is pretty original; I don't think I've ever heard of a story so well-thought out about time-travel/alternate time-lines before. The idea is based on the main character being able to communicate with his father, who's been dead for 30 years. His father hears it then, 30 years earlier. They quickly do some things that shouldn't have happened back then, which then changes the future(or present). The movie deals very well with how they change the future back and forth. The plot is very good, the acting is superb and the characters are all believable. The special effects are very good. The very idea behind the film is very good, but the way it develops so much further is amazing. The ending, while it may seem corny too some, and is, by all means, a bit of a typical Hollywood ending(some might even call it a cop-out), but personally I just think it worked better than anything else could have. I'd recommend this to pretty much anyone who can watch a movie where they have to suspend disbelief, but especially anyone into time-travel or alternate time-lines, as this is, in my opinion, one of the best movies made, concerning this subject. 8/10\", \"Wow, what a suspenseful film! This is a combination crime and fantasy story, a time-travel theme employed as a son is able to talk to his father 30 years in the past and help change history for the better. Far-fetched? Oh, of course, but it's not meant to be taken seriously as something that could happen. Like \\\"Field Of Dreams,\\\" it's pure fantasy but a nice father-and-son vehicle that makes you - or at least it did me - bring a tear or two to your eyes.  The young guy is played by Jim Caviel and his dad is played by Dennis Quaid. Both are excellent and likable guys, as they usually are in the films they play. They talk to each other through an old ham radio. Through it, the son helps save his dad and mom's life on a few occasions and catch a serial-killer in the process. Well, you have to see it because explaining it just makes it sound silly. It's not; it's a fine movie and great escapist entertainment. Once you get into this story, it is impossible to put down. For New York City folks, and fans of the New York Mets, I would imagine this movie has added sentimentality.  Highly recommended.\", \"Going into this film I had no idea what the true story line was. Is it a time travel film, is it a sci-fi film or is it a murder mystery? Well it's a little of each of these. Put behind you images of flying Delorians traversing through time and just let the film soak you in it's original story of what if. What if you could change history and bring back the ones you lost long ago. What if that power came with a price. Is it better to leave things as is or if given the chance to change the world you live in would you? These questions and more rise in this film that ask, would you, could you, should you. Dennis Quaid, in one of his best roles, is a fire fighter from New York in 1969. His hobby is ham radio when not rescuing people from near death in the line of duty. His son John is just a child and dreams of being a baseball player when he grows up. But in the realities of life somethings were not meant to be. John grows up and becomes a police officer working on the homicide squad in 1999, and his father never made it out of a burning building in 1969. On October 10th 1969 sun spots rise up the day before the fatal day in the warehouse. 30 years later the same event happens on the same day in 1999. John finds his fathers radio and begins to play with it and finds a man who seems to have the same call letters and last name. The sun spots allow his radio waves to traverse 30 years into the past to his father. He can save his life with the knowledge of the future and have him back in the present. This comes at a deadly price for in 1969 there is a serial killer who preys on nurses. Johns mother is a nurse. Together John and his father must stop this killer from taking more lives in a game of cat and mouse that unfolds, reverses, and progresses over the 30 year gap. Memories disappear and new ones open in there place, people survive and others die. All this leads to a fantastic final battle of old and new.  This really is a film not to be missed. Fans of thrillers, sci-fi and action will all be pleased with this film.\", \"The plot in Frequency is hard to believe, but the movie's twists, action, and dramatic moments cover up its uncertainties. The idea of how the past affects the future is not original, but the rest of the film is.  When I first saw the preview for Frequency, I thought that the idea of a son talking to a his deceased father over a radio was original and interesting. I didn't think, however, that the film would be very good. I was wrong though. The movie is packed with action, mystery, twists, and emotion. The love between the father and son is so real, as are the characters themselves.  Frequency uses remarkable use of film's ability to stretch out moments of time and intercut between different events. And as far as timing goes, this movie has stopwatch-precision. As a result, it can produce tears, outbursts of laughter, or dropping jaws in the audience.  I think the ending of the movie could be improved, but I still highly recommend seeing this film. As long as you don't worry too much about the plausibility of the time-lapse details, you'll enjoy it. After all, it's entertainment in its finest form.\", \"You can't help it!! You have to cheer and applaud this movie. I can't remember the last time the whole audience clapped at the end of a movie. It has been such a long time since a movie was made that warmed your heart, while keeping you at the edge of your seat. This movie will make you laugh, get a little misty in the eyes, and you won't even notice the time. You're almost sad to see it end. Dennis Quaid is excellent, this is his best movie in years. This movie also has some new faces you won't soon forget. Don't take my word on this, see it your self. You will be thinking about this movie for weeks.\", \"Changing the past to affect the future may not be a new concept in film, but \\\"Frequency\\\" handles it deftly and with heart. The acting is superb, and as far as I can tell the plot is nearly airtight. It keeps you on your toes as the story twists in what feels like six directions at once and keeps you in emotional sync with the characters. The past/present connections are stirring and intriguing, especially the single-flash cuts at pivotal moments.

It is also the worst film of the series. The movie seems to have been improvised from the start to the finish, as the storyline and characters do not make any sense whatsoever. What makes this movie so terrible is that Kane Hodder's portrayal of Jason Voorhees is in the film for about 5 minutes. Did the makers of this film really think that Jason fans would care to see a Jason movie without Jason really being in it? Plus the opening credits in the film last for about 15 minutes! Irritating! Also, the soundtrack sounds like it came from a rejected Disney film. I would strongly recommend not watching this movie at all as it contains no memorable lines, scenes, or characters. Plus, since this is a horror film, horror fans will be disappointed with the uninteresting violence and lack of nudity Jason Goes To Hell has to offer. This film is a complete waste of your time and money.\", \"Interesting \\\"Friday the 13th\\\" entry has nothing connecting it to the last entry (\\\"Jason Takes Manhattan\\\"). Instead, the opening has Jason pursuing a nubile young woman through the woods; she turns out to be an FBI agent who lures Jason right into a trap - and his body is blown to smithereens in the ensuing ambush. HOWEVER (of course, there has to be a \\\"however\\\"), this still doesn't mean that Jason is dead - the evil force that has animated Jason all these years is still very much alive and free to inhabit a succession of victims.  This ninth \\\"Friday the 13th\\\" movie has some interesting story twists that were only then, after eight previous movies, being concocted.  This is an energetic, emphatically violent, lively (and very mean-spirited, unfortunately) horror sequel with spectacular gore (particularly in the unrated director's cut) and performances that are actually something approaching decent.  An entertaining way to spend an hour and a half.  There are a few visual in-jokes that horror fans will instantly recognize.  In addition to playing Jason, stuntman Kane Hodder also appears sans makeup as one of two FBI agents (he's the big, bearded one) guarding the morgue.  Even if you don't enjoy it, you may want to stick around for the surprise in the very last scene. It will either make you groan or clap, depending on your disposition towards these kinds of movies.  8/10\", \"I was a bit confused. I mean, they changed the whole story. It was a bit annoying. Now Jason can take the form of other bodies? I wonder what it would be like if he took the body of Gary Colman? Hehe! I should have stuck with the comments here on IMDb. A lot people said that this is the worst sequel. They were right. I would not really recommend this, unless you are on the same journey as I am. Have I converted to the Jason side? Nope. I don't think the 10th sequel is going to change my mind either. I will still watch and hopefully enjoy \\\"Jason X\\\". But I will be honest, Jason is a very cool killer. He just needs better movies. And they kept up with the traditional blood, gore, sex, nudity, stupid teenagers, and a silly plot. So, I simply must be kind.  2/10\", \"The opening sequence is a failure. A closer contact between Jason and the victim could have drawn us into the movie much better. The old formula of sex/nudity + a slasher doesn't appeal anymore. The camera technique, editing, and sound don't work together to keep its audience at the edge of their seats. After the first sequence, you'll know that there is nothing much to expect in this film. For a horror flick to work, the opening sequence should say it all and must entice the audience that this film will scare them to death till the end).  This last installment of the Friday the 13th series simply doesn't have \\\"it\\\" to make you want to finish the film. It doesn't bother with the story anymore. It felt like its only goal is to be more brutal than the previous killings. It introduces new characters every after a killing which further alienates the viewers from the film. No depth; no emotional tie up with the characters; each character is simply another object awaiting their gory mutilation. Unless you have a penchant for murders and brutality then this movie isn't just worth your while. Or even if you have a thing for gore, this movie has nothing new to offer--it's a been there, done that kind of thing. So uninteresting.  I don't understand why the producers of this series, knowing that this is the last, would not put much thought on how to end Jason's classic plight. OR maybe, it's just that the series have exhausted all there is to exhaust of Jason and this movie hasn't got enough juice to quench the audience for an hour and a half of the worn out, dried up Jason story.\", \"After the unsuccessful Friday THE 13TH PART VIII:JASON TAKES MANHATTAN, which was dumb to begin with, Paramount gave the rights to JASON to New Line. Which I think was a great idea, because they explored JASON to a different state of mind. Writers Dean Lorey & Jay Huguely and director Adam Marcus took the series in a different new look.  JASON(Kane Hodder) somehow is out of New York and is back at Camp Crystal Lake, only to tracked down and killed by the F.B.I.. This is where the fun starts, JASON heart beats an evil tone and forces a doctor to eat it, gross I know. Now JASON is transporting into people's bodies. The only way for him to be reborn is a family member, that means Jessica(Kari Keegan) or her baby. And the only person who has the weapon to stop him is the Duke(Steven Williams), with the help of her ex Steven(John D. LeMay). Will they make it in time to save the day.  This has to be one of the top 10 goriest films of all time, see the unrated version. The deaths are over the top yet fit right for this particular flick. This to me should have been called JASON goes wild, because of the harsh punishments he gives people in this. All the acting is great, especially the bodies JASON jumps into. But Steven Williams stole the whole movie with his excellent one liners and top notch deliverance for all his scenes. The only thing that hurts this movie is it's lack to explain itself for most of it's scenes. For example, \\\"How did JASON come from New York to here?, What is the real reason for JASON evilness?\\\", although the last one was answered, just not the way you would expect it to be and not clean it up enough. Still a good movie, but confusing.\", \"The film opens with this hot chick stripping down completely nude and starting to take a bath. I thought, \\\"Oh boy, here we go.\\\" A few seconds later she hears something outside. She says, \\\"Who's there?\\\" and runs outside the room (scantily clad, mind you) to see who it is.  She's chased outside by a homicidal maniac and runs through the woods, her robe falling off and revealing more pointless nudity. Finally she lures the monster into a circle of gunfire from a SWAT team who finally manage to kill Jason (apparently repetitive gunshots make him implode on impact).  Then this balding man pats the half-naked girl -- who is now revealed to be a brainy cop -- on the back and says something like, \\\"Good work, Sergeant, we'll get a promotion for you!\\\" Meanwhile she's standing around naked with only a robe.  For a moment I thought to myself, \\\"This is either going to be the worst movie ever made, or a clever parody of its predecessors.\\\" I mean, either the whole nudity part with the female cop was just there for the sake of nudity, or it was a parody of the fact that every \\\"Friday the 13th\\\" movie has at least one scene of gratuitous female flesh.  Unfortunately my first assumption was correct. This is an awful movie. It only gets worse and worse as time goes on. It's entertaining, sure, in a so-bad-it's-hilarious kind of way. The characters are all clich\\u00e9d to the point of nausea and the killing scenes are so standard it's like doing a paint-by-numbers, it's already mapped out for you ahead of time.  This isn't the worst film ever but it's certainly a very bad, cheesy, poorly acted, amateurish title in the \\\"Jason\\\" series and the fact that it was indeed NOT the last \\\"Friday the 13th\\\" film is rather ironic in itself.\", \"After Jason was killed in the last 8 entries, it seems rather stupid to try and explain that this would indeed be the last time, especially since they would go back on their word, also their Final Chapter was hardly the last. However this time the story is a little different as now Jason has been led into an ambush and is blown to pieces, however his evil heart lives on and he possesses various people to kill people who are a threat to his immortality, as a bounty hunter says that only a Voorhies can kill him, this of course leads to his sister, niece and grandniece, they are the only ones who can stop him. Jason Goes To Hell:The Final Friday is titled a little weirdly in that New Line had just bought the franchise and yet they claimed to only make one movie out of it? However the problem here is that the mumbo jumbo explaining Jason's evil isn't very well explained and although it's admirable to offer an explanation, just as many unanswered questions surface. For instance is the character of Duke(Missing In Action 2's Steven Williams) who seems to know about the rituals and such. Where did he find this out? Of course nobody expects logic in a ninth entry in a series but give us something. Also of great disappointment is that Jason is hardly in it, at the beginning and at the very end. However I give them points for trying and although it doesn't emerge as the thriller aimed for, there are some inspired moments of gore. Also the film is watchable through out.  * * out of 4-(Fair)\", \"Just saw this total piece of dog you know what on cable. Now when it comes to the Friday the 13th movies you don't expect much especially with all the really awful sequels. This was a toss up between this complete and total atrocity on celluloid. There's movies so bad they're funny but this was a movie that was just plain godawful. This sequel apparently jason can suddenly be reincarnated over and over again and beyond that it probably will cause brain damage to try and waste any further brain cells on trying to understand the pointlessness of what was written by a sadistic 12 year old pervert. It was a toss up between this and Jason Takes Manhattan in terms of idiocy and continuity not that it really takes a lot to come up with something not as stupid and bad as this.\", \"Apparently \\\"Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday\\\" was intended to be the last film of the series, which it is, if you don't count 2003's \\\"Freddy Vs. Jason\\\" as Friday film. This movie starts out with a beautiful young woman in a cabin in the middle of the woods one night (wow, original). She is chased through the woods (wrapped in a bath towel) by Jason, who is then blown up by a mob of FBI swat men into complete smithereens. After his remains are taken to a biology lab, the psycho maniac seems to live on through his heart... and he begins to take over other human's bodies. So, he begins his psychotic slaughter rampage through out the Crystal Lake area, in the body of the coroner who was in charge of his remains, slashing and hacking up teens and others who (unfortunately) happen to cross his path.  I enjoyed this film alright, but the whole concept of it was a little far-fetched for me. The whole idea of Jason's 'soul' living on in another body completely threw this out of what one would expect in a \\\"Friday the 13th\\\" installment. Aside from this kooky idea, the film has some neat visual effects and is loaded with a heavy amount of gore. Just rent the unrated DVD and you'll see just how bloody this thing is. Along with the gore there is the typical premarital sex between some dumb teens, who ultimately get hacked to death (quite brutally I might add) by Jason one evening. The movie is enjoyable, fun horror if you don't take it seriously. But when it comes down to it, the removal of Jason's body (I suppose that's how you'd say it), this movie is yanked out of the series and doesn't seem to fit very well with the rest (much like \\\"Jason X\\\"). And the weird ending featuring Freddy Krueger's hand (which is now explained by \\\"Freddy Vs. Jason\\\") was a little far out there.  Overall, if you're a fan of the series, you'll want to see this I'm sure. While it may not be very good, there is plenty of gore to offer and a few nice touches. But more than likely fans of this series will be disappointed with this movie. 4/10.\", \"Like all the other Jason movies i loved it. Its a bit over natural but thats good, the director goes over the limit and i love that just like in all the other Jason movies.  The movie is brilliant too. Unenspecting scenes just keep coming. I cant believe that people actually votes 1 for this movie.  Loved it. Sexy girls and all the things a movie needs to be good. There probably a bottle of nerds here that voted 1 because OH A NAKED LADY!  I give the movie 7. Not eight but 7...  Im so locking forward to the nesxt Jason movie, how are you today? im a died man walking, how are you? Im a living man dead. .\", \"The best of the entire series is here.  Jason has returned, but is shot down with a vengeance by a large police force. After he is blown to body parts, it seems that the maniacal Jason is finally dead.  But he's not. The only way that Jason can return is by gaining a new body, and he does this immediately, jumping from body to body, killing person after person, ruining life after life.  The final death of Jason is here at long, long last, and, as unexpected, requires a visit to his old childhood home.  I'll say, this is the only sequel in the entire series that is ACTUALLY scary. It's a wonderful horror film, and defeats ALL of the series, INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL, by a really, REALLY long shot.  (It even sparks the beginning of Freddy VS. Jason... Hmmm...)\", \"Me growing up watching the Friday the 13th series, left me loving it,but this part was the WORST, i hated it so much and it makes me feel like never ever watching any part of its series again. The cast was lame,the acting was very poor, and the script was disgusting,this makes part 5 looks soooooo good.There's a new Freddy V.S jason coming out and I'M NOT looking forward to seeing it. Out of 5 Acting-1.0 Actors-1.0 Script-0.5 Display-1.5 Performace-1.0 Suspence-1.0 Credits-1.5 End-1.5 Overall-1.1/5.0  F  \", \"Even though I liked this last entry (yeah, right) in the Friday the 13th series, a part of me can understand why others don't care for it. Since Jason technically only appears (at least in the form we are used to) twice, and spends the rest of the movie jumping from body to body, this might be seen as tampering a bit too much with a comfortable formula.  Personally, I was so glad that I was seeing something new here, (although it's actually not all that new as anybody who has seen the fun cult, sci-fi/action flick \\\"The Hidden\\\" can attest to,) that I was willing to put aside a few minor quibbles. Like what, you say? Well, it would have been nice if the Creighton Duke character had been a little more heroic instead of being such a jerk. Also: Where in the Hell did the \\\"magic dagger\\\" come from.  Still, there were a few scenes here that are pure gold.  #1: The opening bit where Jason faces off with the SWAT team. I had always wondered why nobody ever tried that before. Big dude isn't so tough when faced with high powered weaponry, is he?  #2: The scene with the coroner and Jason's heart. It's just so goofy watching him chow down on it like a Big Mac, I laugh everytime.  #3: The slo-mo diner attack. The \\\"monster attacks the good guys who are trapped in a diner\\\" is a classic horror movie stand-by. I get a warm feeling everytime I see it.  Oh, one more point a friend brought to my attention: The hero of the movie sure can do a god job punching people after Duke breaks his fingers!\", \"Reasons Jason Goes to Hell is the worst in a pretty good series of slasher films:  1) Jason is not scary when he's on \\\"American Casefiles\\\" (I think that's what the \\\"America's Most Wanted\\\"-like TV show was called. The whole reason he was scary was because he was this backwoods, crazy type of character that was based soley in legend and newspaper writings. Putting him on TV sucks. So does having the FBI go after him.  2) He looks stupid in this one. That skin bubbling over the hockey mask is just dumb.  3) They try to put too much plot in it. Come on, it's a Friday the 13th movie (isn't it?)! Forget this body-hopping and \\\"Hellbaby\\\" garbage and get the hell back in the woods, Jason!\", \"Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday opens with Jason being blown to bits by a S.W.A.T. team at Camp Crystal Lake. That's right...He's done. Oh, but wait! His soul begins to pass from body to body, and he continues his violent killing spree in this manner. Oh, I know it sounds stupid but in reality its...No, you're right. It's stupid.  This movie tries to give Jason so much back story that it can't even handle it. We've got the inclusion of Jason's half sister (I'm guessing a rip off of Halloween), and the fact that Jason is immortal because of some device from the Evil Dead series. It turns out that the only way to really kill Jason is to stab him with a magical dagger that only works in the hands of another Voorhees. Apparently that doesn't even work due to Jason X and Freddy Vs. Jason as well as the upcoming sequel. Oh, and the only way he can take back his original body is through a Voorhees. This causes some problems.  The characters in this movie are all retarded. They all seem like they're there for comic relief. There's not one serious role in the whole film. The addition of all the mythical b.s. takes all the accountability out of the series...Or whatever accountability was left. There were two parts of this movie I liked. One was the opening. This film opens like a classic Friday the 13th and gives you some hope that it will be okay. Then of course, Jason is blown to bits, just like the movie's plot. The other scene I liked was the end where Jason's mask is lying in the sand after he's been sent to hell, so Freddy Krueger reaches up to grab it. This of course led to 2003's Freddy Vs. Jason. This is a terrible movie, and should only be viewed by true Jason lovers.  2/10\", \"To wrap your head around Jason Goes to Hell, would be like trying to wrap your head around Paris Hilton actually releasing a CD. It doesn't make sense to you and it probably never will. If it came down to it, go with Jason Goes to Hell, because Paris Hilton, sucks, big time. But back to Jason. Jason Goes to Hell basically is the directors attempt to try and make Jason more than just a brute, slashing, zombie.  However in the end it just goes even more so. Adding fuel to the fire for people who hate the Friday series. And with this installment, who can blame them? The premise itself is very ridiculous, Jason is blown into a million pieces, then comes back through the bodies of others. Wow, great plot right? Well maybe if you like trying to think about what the hell is going on.  You start with a coroner, he eats Jason's heart. That makes sense... moving on. Jason goes around killing teens and adults again. And then eventually (For the last few minutes of the film.) Becomes himself again. Add in the mix of a Bounty Hunter who has a grudge (For an unexplained reason.) A family dagger which can somehow kill Jason, and Freddy Kreuger. And you have yourself a movie filled with more plot holes than teens murdered. This film does make up for it with more 'inventive' kills, but not even that can make this film great. It's OK for Friday Fans, if not, then steer clear.\", \"Jason Goes to Hell is a sequel that brings something new to the franchise by having Jason destroyed at the beginning but he still lives through his heart and after making a coroner eat it he posses him and continues killing people until he finds a new host to put his heart in.  But these bodies cannot work for long, if something happens to them he needs a new host but the only way he can have his original body is if he finds a blood relative a transfer his heart into her.  The blood relative also has the power to stop Jason with a dagger that once impaled in his immortal heart will send him to hell and the bounty hunter knows that.  So Steve and Jessica confront Jason and after cutting the bodies head open Jason's heart that has sprouted a head, arms and tail crawls out and is thrown into the basement where he finds the body of his sister that he killed earlier on. After going into her the Bounty hunter tells them that he doesn't have to be reborn through a living Vorhees woman.  And so Jason is in his same body again and while fighting Steve Jessica impales the dagger into Jason sending him into hell.  And has Jessica and Steve and their little daughter walk off Freddy Kruger's hand comes out the ground and pulls Jason's mask into the ground, this inspired the Freddy Vs Jason idea.  Although Jason is not in it much the idea of telling us what makes Jason immortal and how to kill him was quite good. 10/10\", \"i don't know how somebody got this film funded. this is by far one of the worst films ever made, and i like the other 9. if you do watch this, get the unrated version; it is significantly better for gore fans. i do still watch it for the blood and laughs. the premise is that only a vorhees can kill jason and she has to use a specific knife. so, jason has a living relative somehow...but that's not the complicated part of the story. jason is ambushed by the s.w.a.t. team (i'll never understand why a s.w.a.t. team member would pause for a shower when trying to draw a serial killer into a trap) and blown to bits. then, naturally, a mortician eats jason's heart (out)! now, the mortician has the power and mind of jason, but it wears on him, like in stephen king's \\\"desperation\\\" and \\\"the regulators\\\" (as richard bachman), so he has to pass on the heart when the body starts to wear, and then somebody else is jason. then the ending. i hate to give it away, so stop reading if it will bother you to find out this travesty of an ending. he gets stabbed, but isn't dying, so massive hands from hell burst through the ground and start to drag him into hell! you think it's over, but no! then the wind starts to blow the dust, and you see that his mask is still there...and freddy kruger's claw bursts through the ground and pulls away the mask while laughing. what an appropriate ending to that one. the good news is, i use this for an example in my class as a deaux ex machima each semester.\", \"I just wanna say this was an excellent movie to finish the series of the hockey mask killer, i can tell it was excellent because i am the greatest fan of Friday the 13th!!!. I was really anxious when i was going to watch is buy the first time, it really surprised me with things the others movie didn't have like Jason going body by body.  The part i really enjoyed was when Jason got into the police station and defeated all the cops, then when he got into the restaurant and everybody was shooting him. Ja JA JA!! But no bullet can stop him.  I really liked it, now i can wait for the new movie of Friday the 13th: \\\"I hope it to come this year\\\". I also i am the biggest fun of nightmare on elm street and if this new movie is a sequel between Jason and Freddy much better!!!!\", \"\\\"Jason Goes to Hell\\\" is the ninth and so-called final \\\"Friday\\\" which finally has Sean Cunningham back as producer. This sequel is known for it's less than traditional take on the admirably repetitive series in which Jason is ambushed and blown to pieces in the first five minutes. That's sure a devastating kick in the nuts for us Voorhees fans, but no need to fret - his psychotic soul ends up possessing the coroner who uncontrollably devours the throbbing heart and roars like freaking Godzilla. Now in his new form, the J-man sets out after his only remaining family members who are the only ones capable of killing him for good. Though Jason himself only appears throughout a very small portion of the movie, this is a very decent sequel and a nice change of pace for the franchise, giving it a good ending (before \\\"Jason X\\\" came along, that is). The death scenes are memorably nasty, especially that naked chick getting slit from the torso - up in the tent! I guess that was more rod than she could handle! That's what you get for sexing it up in a F13 flick! tsk tsk! Also dug Jason's method for body swapping - the ol' slug down the throat. That sorry bastard melting all over everything is a kick ass scene as well. Even if you weren't enough of a fan to sit through all of the previous sequels give this one a chance for it's wonderfully bloody demises and the different, almost supernatural way Jason gets his dirty deeds done. He may be in hell, but you just can't keep a good machete wielding man-child undead carcass with a hockey mask down!\", \"Seemingly unstoppable and indestructible killer Jason Voorhees (hulking behemoth Kane Hodder in peak menacing form) finally gets blown to bits by the feds in an ambush, but he ain't down for the count just yet. Jason this time takes over the bodies of other folks so he can continue butchering people. Moreover, he can either be reborn or destroyed by a blood relative. Director Adam Marcus, working from a clever script by Dean Lorey and Jay Huguely, relates the compelling story at a constant snappy pace, maintains a mean, brutal tone throughout, delivers plenty of nasty gore (a young lady getting impaled on a tent spike while doing just what you think with her boyfriend rates as the definite splatter highlight), further tarts things up with a welcome sense of self-mocking black humor, offers a generous sprinkling of tasty female nudity, stages the murder set pieces with rip-roaring brio (the delightfully outrageous diner massacre sequence in particular seriously smokes), and really goes for broke with a gloriously wild ending which comes complete with one doozy of a sequel set-up punchline. The solid cast contribute admirably sincere performances: John D. LeMay makes for a refreshingly unlikely hero as the nerdy Steven Freeman, Kari Keegan likewise impresses as the sweet Jessica Kimble, Steven Williams almost steals the whole show with his colorful portrayal of flamboyant bounty hunter Creighton Duke, plus there are neat turns by Erin Gray as the spunky Diana Kimble, Allison Smith as Jessica's cheery gal pal Vicki, Steven Culp as opportunistic TV newscaster Robert Campbell, Billy Green Bush as the hard-nosed Sheriff Ed Landis, and Rusty Schwimmer as feisty, foul-mouthed diner owner Joey B. William Dill's slick cinematography gives the picture a properly moody look. Harry Manfredini's amped-up version of his familiar shivery score hits the shuddery spot. The make-up effects by KNB are first-rate. Unjustly ridiculed by most fans of the series, this outing sizes up as one of the more creative and entertaining entries in the long-running slasher horror series.\", \"I think its a travesty how this movie has taken so much heat compared to the rest of the series. While I love this kind of camp, every character, plot and film in this series has largely been interchangeable with the others.  Fast forward to 1993 and we have a film that attempts to add innovations like pop horror references to the films Evil Dead and Nightmare on Elm Street without resorting to half-baked comedy (I'm looking at you Freddy). We have a film that updates Jason's by-now clich\\u00e9d features to a more sublime grotesque, looking like a serial killer would look if he ignored hygiene for 20 years during his hacking and slashing hayday.  The plot makes a marked improvement from \\\"I know they're all gonna die, but how?\\\" to \\\"What the hell could possibly kill Jason? What does the Necronomicon have to do with it (merely a mystery in the mythology)? Jason has family? and We're finally going to get some friggin' resolution here?\\\" Come on people: Jason X should have been shunned by any self-respecting fan after all the promos claimed this to be \\\"The Final Friday\\\". Plus finished it in what I considered to be a climactic finale. Instead you crawled back on your knees like the creatures of habit that you are, always willing to settle for another broken promise and failed expectation from a marketable franchise. Note: Let's be fair though, none of us could have helped wanting to see Freddy Vs. Jason.  To the creators of this movie, I give you props. Besides most of the people on IMDb who hated this movie either don't like the slasher genre or can't friggin' spell \\\"slasher genre\\\".\", \"Let's understand two things about slasher horror from the 1980's: first of all, they had a legacy of saturating their own market, and secondly, they were simple stories born out of the twilight of an ever changing world.  With this in mind, it would be easy to point out what is wrong with Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday- however for the sake of time, it might just as well be easier to point to what's right about it. The answer to that is: NOTHING! All you ever wanted to know about Jason is revealed, and once you know the dark secret, it will haunt you- except for a small matter of cosmetics, the \\\"dark secret\\\" is the same as the lemon revealed a short time earlier in New Line's bad \\\"finale\\\" to the Nightmare movies. Of course, the only nightmare about that film was having to admit that you paid to watch it- it is much the same with this piece of total garbage.  Jason, it would seem, is not merely a specter capable of regeneration with a great rage at those who he feels are responsible for both his own and his mother's demise. Oh no, the dark secret is that if you can find someone who shares his father's blood line (cause lets face it, his mother was not born a Voorhees), then you can see Jason finally put to death, or you can see him re-born. Guess what happens here.  Except the rebirth is anti-climatic because he is nothing more than the same twisted mass of flesh that he was before he was blown apart by bombs and bullets at the beginning of the movie. And apparently genetics has a preference for certain types of clothing, and a certain mask because he is reborn with both.  In one laughable sequence, you would be forgiven for thinking \\\"Jason\\\" (or as I'd like to refer to him as...the Imposter) being reborn meant the world would end, however a mere 10 minutes or so after he was \\\"reborn,\\\" he is also summarily killed again with an ancient dagger (who were the camp counselors who ignored Jason as he died...some ancient Sumarian or Egyptian people or something? What's with the dagger that must be used? Why does it look like an artifact) supplied to his niece (oh, this is a long story, and is too tedious and boring to go through right now) who finds the Linda Hamilton in her to terminate the 'terminator.' You'll be in for your just desserts if you think this repulsive piece of junk is worth even five minutes of your time. Of course, there is plenty of blood and gore (as the Friday films always seem to have), and there is also plenty to gross you out- but if you think or feel anything towards the horror icon that made these films successful, you ought to take a pass on this one.  Even the soundtrack is awful!\", \"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS  Can a sequel be watched in isolation? When I saw the Halloween and Nightmare series I watched each entry in order. Yet other than the original several years ago I've never before seen a Jason movie.  Maybe if I had then I'd be privy to lots of nuances and depth lost on me while watching Goes To Hell. Maybe if I had seen parts 2-8 then I wouldn't have thought this film was an insufferable piece of tripe.  The movie opens with Jason shot by over a hundred bullets and blown apart by high explosives. Unperturbed by this, his brain lives on, telepathically urging the autopsy Doctor to eat it. Yes, really. The Doc does so in a full-gore depiction, while energy lights from Jason's remains fly out and possess him. This leap from body to body continues, so that even the dubious merits of seeing a murderer in a hockey mask are discarded in favour of secondary actors with mascara hamming a \\\"possessed\\\", zombie-like pallor. There is some Freudian perspective to be had from the Jason hosts' retractable black tongue, though this is surely unintentional. Jason is finally reborn after a red creature grows out of a man's slit throat and rapes a dead mother's corpse. Classy. The high fantasy element takes any level of reality, and therefore fear, away from the movie, but I guess no one bothered to tell the makers.  Scares are non-existent. When a shot Jason (in the form of a police officer) \\\"unexpectedly\\\" comes to life and grabs a woman's leg, we see his eyes open several moments before the \\\"shock\\\" grab, thus negating any suspense. Most of the film works along the same principles, with all scares either signposted or pushed aside to make way for blood and guts violence that fails to compel. The flatness of the direction, coupled with possibly the world's most irritating incidental music, make the whole thing distinctly dirge-like.  Charismatic Steven Williams is leagues ahead of his ultra-forgettable co-stars and is wasted in stuff like this. The fair majority of horror films are lacking in value, but Goes To Hell makes no attempt at artistic worth. The performances, dialogue and plot possess not an iota of inspiration. Didn't the first one have a low-key, independent feel? This one is the brightly-light product of a studio, while a series of gore-riddled set pieces vie for attention.  You sense that parts are actually supposed to be funny, but as the \\\"humour\\\" is so lame and overstated a post-modern satire this isn't. Jason Goes To Hell is everything you associate with bad horror movies, threaded half-heartedly together in semblance of a narrative. The only scene that rises above tedious is the final shot where a claw glove grabs Jason's mask... a clever play on the much-touted Freddy vs. Jason flick. Maybe if Freddy had made an appearance it would've livened things up, for this is a thoroughly dull affair.  Final marks then:  Irrelevant macho fights that drag on and do nothing to further the plot: just the one.  Gratuitous topless shots: 3  Gratuitous and witless uses of the word \\\"f***\\\": I lost count, sorry.  Film's score: 2/10.\", \"It is this movie was awsome I mean it's like i'de even watch all the others if it weren't for Jason and the gore. I dont care if it's WAY WAY to unrealistick that he comes back too life after being blown into billions of peaces. The only thing I find stupid ( and it's not even that big a deal) is that you can only see Jason in front of a mirror that kinda bugged me but then at the end when he is reborn it gets much better. And the whole (new line) insider was kinda stupid too. I think the Jason films are much better than the Freddy's anyway. 9/10\", \"SPOILERS !!!SPOILERS !!!SPOILERS !!!SPOILERS !!!SPOILERS !!!SPOILERS !!!  I don't share this opinion, but I can see why many fans of the series say that this ninth film is the worst in the series. The Jason Vorhees saga started in the early 80's. Spread over 8 films, Jason ( and his mother) have killed almost 100 people in very horrible ways. Jason goes to hell starts with a complete new theory...wich is pretty dumb, I'll give it that. But still, there's as much blood and terror represented in this film as there is in all the other ( to say the least, in fact ) According to a bountyhunter ( who is a pretty good maniac himself ), Jason can be killed for good if a relative of his destroys his heart. If they don't, Jason comes to life again and shall go on killing till eternity. Until Jason finds a family member of his, he keeps on changing bodies. This twist given to his personality kills the magic that is Friday the 13th a bit, that much is true. I never was a giant fan of the series. I've seen them all and liked them but I never agreed with the statement that Friday the 13th is THE best series in horror. Now, I do know a lot of people who think that Jason is as important to horror as Christopher Columbus was to geography, so they think this ninth installment in the series never should have been made. If you're a horror lover in general, you can still enjoy the huge amount of bloody slaughters without paying much attention to the storyline. If you're a diehard Jason Vorhees fan ( or want to become one) ...watch the whole series in a row and judge for yourself if this movie can be considered as blasphemy or not. One other thing is very obvious about this movie : it tries to be more funny than its predecessors and makes several attempt to spoof the genre and the most famous slasher collegues of Jason. For example, when a cop asks where Steven is, the girls answers \\\"He's in front of the MYERS' house!\\\" Funny, huh ? Also, the Necronomicon lies in Jason's basement and when he finally dies, his hockey-mask is grabbed away by the hand of Freddy Krueger himself. So, if you like a good amount of trivia to come with your horror...The Final Friday won't let you down!\", \"I was so excited when the beginning of this film was before my eyes. The music, the darkness, the atmosphere. The beginning of this movie starts off just like the first four. It was tense and it had the exact feel of what we all loved about the early Fridays. The chase, the unnecessary nudity, the false scares, the mirror, and finally Jason in all of his gory splendor coming back one more time to wreak havoc on Crystal Lake. But then suddenly, he is blown up. He is dead, for real this time. I mean he is not like the T-1000 from Terminator that can put himself back together. So how does the movie go on from here? Well to be honest, if the film would have ended after the first ten minutes, I would have been more satisfied than I was at the end of this film. Simply put, I was cheated. I was enticed with what seemed to be a perfect Friday the 13th feel and then they went back to what made the last few suck so bad. What the hell were they thinking? Why the blatant disregard for us as horror fans? And why did they start off so well and then just kill us when Jason dies? By having his spirit enter into the body of some other people, it is a theme that has been done before. And to have the talent to make the Friday feel, and then deviate from that feel, well that is just despicable.  For those of us that really like the films from the early 80's, we were teased. We were lied to and for that I am still mad to this day. And to be honest, when I found out that New Line had decided to produce the films instead of Paramount, I knew that some how, some way, there would be some Freddy reference in it. And besides the beginning, that was actually the best part. Now if they only find a way to make the next film somewhat entertaining, then it could be fun again. But judging by how bad they butchered this one, don't hold your breath.  Steve and Sean should be ashamed of themselves.\", \"how can this film get a higher rating than parts 5 and 8, this is incredible, i mean it's gone beyond being funny cos it's crap, and delved into just plain crap crap. Unbelievable. only gave it a 2 because it has Jason and i was able to watch the whole thing with out switching off. The plot of this film is so diabolical, it's not even got anything to do with Jason, it's over the top cheesy Hollywood, but is so bad u can't even laugh at it. They even used Kane Hodder (Jason) to play the part of a security guard, perhaps cos they couldn't be bothered to cast someone else. IF they used him twice to be funny or give the Friday fans something extra, this is equally as bad. There was big gap between part 8 and 9 so you would have expected them to have come up with something better than this. If this is the only Friday you have seen, this film has no reflection on the others in the series. This film should not have been made. But if u want a good example of a poo movie, this is perfect as it is easy to get hold of.\", \"Not actually killed in Manhattan (surprise, surprise), Jason is still at it until an undercover FBI agent (Julie Michaels, who makes time to take a shower) tricks him into an ambush where he's blown to pieces. If you think being head and limbless will stop Mr. Voorhees from returning to his murderous ways, think again. Now we learn that he can be \\\"reborn\\\" through a blood relative and can possess victims by sending an evil black monster into their bodies (idea stolen from THE HIDDEN).  In a touching tribute to the good ol' days of simplicity, overage-looking \\\"teens\\\" make time for skinny-dipping and tent sex before Jason splits the girl in half with a tent stake. This ninth installment in the endless Friday THE 13TH series features a good cast, but is derivative, annoying, unpleasant and not likely to be the final word in the Jason saga, despite ANOTHER cheat title (remember \\\"The Final Chapter\\\" way back in 1984?).  It played theaters in a cut R version (where it flopped), but the unrated \\\"Director's Cut\\\" video and DVD version restores most of the excellent KNB Group gore effects and some nudity, redeeming factors in a low-grade production like this. Kane Hodder (in his third appearance as Jason) also gets a credit for stunts.\", \"If longtime fans of the \\\"Friday the 13th\\\" saga have anything to say about it, the people behind this film will burn in the same place as its hockey-masked star. \\\"Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday\\\" is completely preposterous, out of place and an affront to what had been a dependable horror series.  Admittedly, director and co-writer Adam Marcus deserves credit for his boldness. He seemed inexplicably convinced that the wheel of the \\\"Friday\\\" series needed to be drastically reinvented, even though fans had lined up for basically the same plot eight times prior. But the brainwave of having Jason possessing one body after another alters the very fabric of what made these films good. Suddenly it's like we're watching an \\\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\\" rip-off. Throw in Jason's newfound grunting, a far-too-heavy plot and a magical dagger (!) and you have something completely unworthy of the \\\"Friday\\\" moniker.  \\\"Jason goes to Hell\\\" is also incredibly lazy. All \\\"Friday\\\" films, by their very nature, require a leap of faith, but this is really too much. Firstly, this marked the first time that no explanation was given for Mr. Voorhees' reemergence. Were we all dreaming when we watched him get melted down to goo in the sewers of New York City? And what about Jason's rebirth toward the end (the most ridiculous moment of any \\\"Friday\\\" film)? How can a little slimy demon be reborn into a man already wearing ripped clothing and a hockey mask? And what about bounty hunter Creighton Duke? It's never explained how he knows so much about Jason and the mythical circumstances surrounding his life. In each of these instances, there seemingly are no easy answers. So rather than be inventive, the writers just threw all of this at us and hoped we would lap it up like thirsty kittens at a milk dish. This sequel completely ignores the continuity of the Jason legend that had been meticulously built up over the years.  What's equally tragic about \\\"Jason goes to Hell\\\" is its insistence on mocking the series. At one point, John D. LeMay's character sarcastically asks a trio of teens headed for Camp Crystal Lake whether they plan to smoke dope, engage in premarital sex and then get slaughtered. Har har. The transformation of Jason into some kind of media star is just as unnerving. Jason is a legend, a mythical figure whispered about in wildly imaginative campfire stories. Yet this movie turns him into a serial killer so well known he makes the TV tabloids and is targeted by the FBI. This is not the Jason we know, and \\\"Jason goes to Hell\\\" is not the \\\"Friday the 13th\\\" we love. It essentially breaks the fingers of the hand that feeds it.  The failure of \\\"Jason goes to Hell,\\\" both in terms of concept and box office revenue, inevitably draws comparisons to the much-panned \\\"Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning.\\\" That film drew plenty of boos for its Jason-less gimmick, but at least it had the feel of a \\\"Friday\\\" flick. \\\"Jason goes to Hell\\\" is substantially worse than any other entry, mainly because it is completely unrecognizable. Like \\\"Part V,\\\" it probably would have worked better as a horror film independent of the Jason saga, rather than dragging Mr. Voorhees into a place he has no business being.  Clearly, Adam Marcus was wrong. The \\\"Friday the 13th\\\" wheel did not need reinventing. The failure of this film (and \\\"Jason X\\\" years later) shows that fans want a return to simpler times when horny teens in cabins were afraid to look out their windows. As the saying goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0097388\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Game 6\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0425055\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Gandhi\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0083987\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Gattaca\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0119177\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Getaway\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0068638\", \"total_review_count\": 1, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"Let me start by saying that I am a fan of Peckinpah.

(It's okay for Carter to involve himself in bad decisions but anyone else). Eventually he gets to the man who killed his brother, and has a vigorous fist fight to his hearts content. (Which was not too bad of a scene. Better than a shootout). Unfortunately, Hollywood being as it is nowadays, cast a geek as the billionaire who is indirectly involved with the brother's murder; but other than that particular miscast the other characters were in form. Not really too bad as a remake. My personal choice though would have been to have Mickey Rourke as Carter.\", \"The fact that this movie was remade, that is. There are only two simple facts for this: either this movie is one bad remake or the first one just sucked to start with. I won't know until I see the original will I, but, presuming the story is pretty much the same I have trouble getting why the later was so infamous. There were no real surprises, everything was obviously clear from the start. The only thing this movie has going for itself is Stallone's cool beard, some nice chicks(Rhona Mitra is breathtaking) and some cool music. The rest is a puzzle of mostly boring action, bad story pace and one liners Stallone's character has to use twice just to show how dumb and uninventive he is. Oh, also a really bad performance by Alan Cumming and some scenes which include Stallone's love interest that have no sense and point to them or the movie at all. 4/10\", \"What a waste of time! With a cast like Stallone, John C. McGinley, Alan Cumming and Michael Caine, it seemed a shoe-in to be a great movie. Instead, it's slow and pretentious, while at the same time directed as if it were Charlies Angels or The Matrix, with clip-and-snip editing and messy camera work. Everything about this movie is garbage. In fact, I have wasted enough time watching, I shall not waste anymore writing about it.\", \".... But that`s probably because I was expecting the worst movie ever made . This remake of the classic Brit thriller is far from being the worst movie ever made but it is rather substandard . Director Stephen Kay seems to have been influenced by MTV and this shows up in his directing , a funeral scenes is accompanied by a Moby song , a punch up is accompanied by Rush Holme With Love by Mint Royale ( A track that seems to be to film soundtracks this decade what Voodoo Chile was to film soundtracks the last decade ) while the final sequence closes with a track from Grove Armada . I do confess I do like MTV but if you don`t you`ll hate this directing style .  There`s two aspects to the script that I disliked . One is the dialogue that tries to be super cool with lines like \\\" Hold on there slick , all of a sudden you`re the f***in` good guy \\\" and \\\" We`ll take it to another level \\\" which sounds false and unconvincing . The other is changes made to the original 1971 movie . I won`t spoil it for you but nearly everything from bleak original has been changed to a completely inferior story . If you liked the way everything worked in the original you`ll dislike the way everything plays out here   The cast are very uneven and strangely for a thriller it`s the female cast members that give the best performances especially Rachael Leigh Cook and Miranda Richardson . It goes without saying Sly fails as a violent anti hero while Alan Cumming is very annoying and camp . Mickey Rourke spends the entire movie posing , John McGinley seems to be on speed while Michael Caine makes little impression .  This remake isn`t as bad as some people have made out though it`s not nearly as good as the original . I give it four out of ten\", \"Because the original, with Caine as Carter, was so good, I thought that this would be an interesting update. Change the country to the U.S. and Seattle becomes the city \\\"up north.\\\"   Stallone mumbles his way through the movie. Plot is impossible to follow. No need for the teen-age daughter to have her dark secrets. Evidently the story is supposed to lead us to a Bill Gates type. Not good.  Good to see Michael Caine though.  I own the original. Would never watch this again. In the original Caine was shot for his troubles. Stallone should be shot for botching up a terrific idea.\", \"From Stephen T. Kay (of \\\"The Shield\\\" fame) comes a Get Carter 're-make', but viewers shouldn't treat this as a re-make of the film - rather a modern re-interpretation of the book \\\"Jack's Return Home\\\" (1970). The basic premise is the same, an injustice followed by revenge - but this film is an excellent work in it's own separate right. The limited connections between the films are the book, the film title and a few references to the 1971 film (and Caine's presence in both). There is a lot of \\\"film snobbery\\\" out there about Stallone and it's true that he's had his fair share of c*** films, but this isn't one of them. His acting would put a lot of people to shame, in fact it's a superb performance (also see \\\"Copland\\\"). His presence dominates his scenes, only Caine and Mickey Rourke's presence competes. The supporting actors are very good too and the storyline is such that if you blink you'll miss the thread. People who say \\\"I didn't get it\\\", frankly just need to see the film again. It definitely deserves multiple viewings. Also, look how many comments the film has - always a good guide as to whether a film has made an impact or not - twice as many as the original and 2/3 as many as Taxi Driver.....  Not to mention the film is beautifully shot, brilliantly edited and has a Greeaaat soundtrack!\", \"This action-drama is never really a thriller. That's because the mostly predictable storyline revolves around one man's desire for revenge. Jack Carter (Sylvester Stallone), a trained killer, spends a third of his journey using violence to learn the truth of his brother's death. The other two thirds he spends inflicting death on those he deems responsible for the younger Carter's demise.  The dynamic between Carter's niece, Doreen, and Jack does play out beautifully. But more of the screenplay could have been devoted to this relationship. Instead, the writer makes sure that it's just enough to justify Stallone's gun-toting or fist-wielding ways.  I began to question the realism of this film early on. For one thing, we never hear a police siren until the final seconds of the movie. Enough people lose their life in this film, that this makes Carter's ho-hum killing spree seem pretty unbelievable. That makes the rest of this flick come tumbling down, since old-fashioned justice is the point of the film.\", \"When the movie starts, you hear pretentious music. Sylveser Stallone is on a funeral with his classy sunglasses and his designer suit. This all wants to look full of promise. It is already way to obvious. The director is still in the conviction that he can move his audience with these simple and obvious tricks. This does not work, at least not with a critical public that has seen some more movies.   Sylvester Stallone plays the part of Jack Carter, performed before by Micheal Caine who stars in this movie as well. Jack Carter is mad because his brother has been culled by either Jeremy Kinnear (Alan Cumming) or Cyrus Paice (Mickey Rourke). He wants of course, as it behooves a real hero, immediate retaliation. He is going to scare Jeremy and Cyrus. Our stalwart fellow gets in his beautiful Cadillac, puts his gun in his pocket and drives to the victims he is going to take care of. Actually that is what the story is about. We should not forget the girl, performed by Rachael Leigh Cook.  Almost everything about this movie is bad. The story is as shallow as a baby tub, the dialogs are awful and the acting is brazenly bad. Sylvester Stallone plays his worst part ever. Stallone must be either Rambo or Rocky, but not Jack Carter. This man is not able to express emotions. Throughout the whole movie he plays the tough guy, right in the middle however he is this sensitive man who can cry as well. I can't even remember why he actually cried, but it was about something silly. Stallone is a strong man who can run after bears and shoot with bazookas, but he is absolutely not apt to play a normal human being with feelings.  The dialogs are horrible. It goes approximately like this: Doreen: Why did you leave when your mother died? Jack: Just because, what is your favorite color? Doreen: Pink, yours? Jack: Blue. Doreen: Why? Jack: Just because.  The dialog is as thin as paper. When something is stated, the actors just do not go any deeper. The questions are answered briefly and then the dialog continues with another silly question.  Mickey Rourke does, except for his muscles, not add anything to the movie. His dialog is shallow as well, he is the tough guy who should be removed by Jack 'the man' Carter.  Of the actors are not culpable of the bad dialogs. It must be terrible to star in a movie which is directed by such an ignorant director. You must earn your money however, otherwise there will be no bread in the cupboard.\", \"Great for this kind of movie - Stallone wasn't invincible & did some fine acting - His introspection choosing humanity did not come off as corny & I felt his character was very likable.  Mickey Rourke keeps alive the question of whether he is crazier on screen or off - Will he grow up & become Christopher Walken later in life?  Miranda & Rachel both get A's for acting outside the stereotype - I'd like to give the little French girl a bite at her spot of specification - The film's dialogue was better than usual as was all its writing.  No gaffs, major or minor - I enjoyed this remake more than its original, which was also worth viewing in my opinion but just didn't get my involvement or support as much as this one - I'd stay up late to watch this one again.\", \"I saw the original on TV years ago when I was a kid. The movie had to be edited down for TV viewing, because some of it was too graphic. The film was dark, noir and a bit Avant garde. Caine's acting was creepy and strangely sadistic and evil. Yet it was a bit hard to accept Caine as a tough guy.  Stallone rebounds in this thoughtful remake. He's a different kind of actor than Caine, perhaps not as eloquent, but definitely more convincingly tough. Sly's Carter has a heart, soft spot so to speak. Caine's Carter was a sadistic pig with barely any redeeming quality. Both versions work in their own way, however. But I'm glad Sly chose this project. See both versions for yourself and decide.\", \"Sylvester Stallone's career took a turn for the worst here with \\\"Get Carter,\\\" a dry action film about revenge. Jack Carter returns home to his brother's funeral and decides to solve the mystery surrounding his brother's death. Perhaps the only thing interesting about the film is the friendship made between Jack and his niece, but even this is marred by a plot twist that's handled with such discomfort that it doesn't seem to belong in a movie with the Italian Stallion. Also starring Michael Caine, from the original \\\"Get Carter,\\\" and the ever-so-versatile Alan Cumming, I really expected more from this movie. But the film loses its steam after the opening credits.\", \"I remember the 1971 version of \\\"Get Carter\\\", well this version of it I would say I like the best. At both versions have one thing in common, Michael Caine. Unlike the first one, Sly Stallone is the main character, Jack Carter. His look for the movie is way cool, and I like the way he handled things. When the details were of the underground world, no one handles the problems the way Carter does. There's plenty of car chases, shooting, and of course killing some, Carter does all that. In this version of the movie Michael Caine plays the character Cliff Brumby. I think it's fair enough that the original star should have his place in a remake. I know why the critics put down this movie so hard. To me, I wouldn't let get to me, for the way I see it, I enjoyed it very well. Making the promises is always something for everyone to keep, Carter doesn't back out or down to anything. This is one remake I think is very good, I see what I like, and everything else is good entertainment. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.\", \"After seeing this version of Get Carter and the original, I think they are both good in their own way. I don't think you can hate the new version and like the old version. They are both so similar that you can't hate the new one. You can prefer the old to the new though. Personally I like the new Get Carter more. I thought the original was good though. Michael Caine was good in his way. Sly Stallone was good in his own way.  The Stallone remake of Get Carter could've been a lot better. It is really the director's fault if it was weak. You can blame the writer too. Some lines were pretty lousy. I think it is safe to say that the directing and writing wasn't very good. You can blame them, but you can not blame Stallone. He did the best he could with what he got. I think he was perfect for this kind of Jack Carter. Not a dark one, but a good one. Stallone's Carter is one that is trying to do something right for once in his life. All his life he was a bad guy on the wrong side of the tracks, but now he's going home and he's trying to make things right. Like Caine's Carter, he's not leaving until he finds out who killed his brother. No matter what, he's going to make sure they pay.  Then when he finds out what happened to his niece that really sets him off and drives him even further. Everyone responsible for the murder of Richie and rape of Doreen is going to pay. I found that scene on the rooftop with Jack and his niece to be very touching. He was telling her how it wasn't her fault and Rachel Leigh Cook really did come off as a girl that was raped.  People have a problem with Jack living in the end of this one. But what they don't realize is, Get Carter is like a western. The stranger rides in to town, makes the bad guys pay and then rides off into the sunset when his work is done. It makes you feel a lot better knowing that Jack made all of the bad guys pay and finally found redemption in the end. I hated the ending to the original because of how it just came out of nowhere. It made no sense. It was almost like they put that in there because they were forced into it. Michael Caine's Jack Carter did wrong and he still had to pay for it. Michael Caine did show in one scene that his Jack did have a heart. When he sees Doreen being raped in that porn film, you can see him shedding tears. Stallone did not shed tears in the new version, but at that point he was angry and out for blood. He did get a little emotional on the rooftop with Doreen though. In the Caine version he never does see Doreen again. There was more of a relationship between Jack and Doreen and I liked that. In the new version you also got to see where Richie's wife and daughter were coming from when Jack shows up after years. I never did get that feeling in the original. I liked this movie and I think if people give it a chance they will like it too. The director and writer did almost ruin it. If not for the whole foundation of the story and for Sylvester Stallone, the movie wouldn't be good. Personally I like Sylvester Stallone. When you see his wonderful Rocky movies you can tell the guy's got some heart. I never will forget him for making those Rocky movies that I grew up watching and loving. Some day I would like to meet Sylvester Stallone.   By no means is this movie as good as Stallone's classics. But it is almost as good as his decent action movies that came out in the 90's. This movie isn't up there with Rambo IV. But if Sylvester Stallone had directed this movie and wrote it, it could've been a hell of a lot better. Stallone has been approached to star in and direct a Death Wish remake. You have no reason to worry if it happens. Stallone will be in the director's chair this time. Not Stephen Kay.\", \"It is worth the price of admission, but I did not like the quick-editing techniques in the movie. I was with the movie but 20 minutes before the end the story could have been written better. Just a little less vengefulness was needed in certain places.  All and all, Sly Stallone's acting is enough to make this film entertaining. It is good to see him put himself and his style of acting into the film.  I might add, movie score and incidental music was superb Good compositioning and orchestration. Good Seattle scenery, and some Pacific Northwest scenes.\", \"In this ass kicking, mother eating high tech action film the former king of Hollywood once again gives a water proof performance in the role of Jack Carter. The film is a full blooded hit in the mix of excitement and sensibility and I wish and hope that everyone goes and sees it!\", \"Re-lace my tennis shoes, count the number of cracks on my bedroom wall, and rearrange the fuzz in my navel. These are just a few of the things I would have liked to do instead of watch this movie. I wasn't tired or stressed, I had just finished off a pot of Green Mountain coffee and I still managed to doze off for a minute or two during the movie. The plot was ok but the best way to describe this movie is just plain boring. There is barely any action (unless you call seeing Stalone's aged and vein-ridden muscles action) and when there was a car chase or fight scene, it was just ... boring. There were a few twists to the story but these were barely enough to keep me watching until the end. If you have a choice between shaving every hair on your body with a rusty razor while standing on a beach ball or watching this movie, I would go with the rusty razor.\", \"What a waste of talent and cinematography. I saw the DVD version and the photography and setting was great; very crisp and rich. The casting was fine and the script was a proven one. Must have been really bad direction?? Car chases were fine, but I especially enjoyed the one in the Christmas tree lot! I thought it also kind of totally fell apart in the last 1/3\", \"Sly looked cool and tough in the trailer and the poster and the cover of the video box. He's a little girlie man in the movie. This is one of the worst \\\"action\\\" movies ever made. The director didn't know how to move it along. It reminded me of a cheap movie called \\\"the swap\\\" which was called something else and had footage of a young Robert DeNiro in it. You know the movie I'm talking about, you saw it at Suncoast for $6.99 and almost bought it because it had a big picture of Robert DeNiro on it. THAT movie is better than this.  Really, I'm not kidding. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.   \", \"  This movie was not a mediocre remake. Though I haven't seen the original I thought the acting was done well, and the characters all had some heart put into them. Sly did a heck of a job portraying a character who if brought back to any degree of real life would have been better. If you had been put into this movie, I doubt you would have done better! Good Work,Sly!  \", \"This film is awful. What keeps it from being a 1 (1-10 scale) is the lack of a zero choice for such movies as Robot Monster, Best Defense and Fair Game. The editing is terrible, the script is worse and the acting is the very worst (\\\"You don't wanna know me.\\\" -- Another stupid attempt at starting a catch-phrase).  Gretchen Mol had the good sense not to have her name on this mess.\", \"First things first, I want to clear something up. The critics are wrong again. Worst remake ever? Get serious. Not even close. Has any of this armchair experts bothered to watch the new \\\"Stepford Wives\\\" or \\\"Planet of the Apes\\\"? I can easily list two dozen remakes that sucked far far worse. With that out of the way, I want to say I liked Stallone he was a obvious choice and especially Mickey Rourke. Rourke had just the right mix of sleaze ball zen master attitude and macho coolness to pull it off. Caine was a perfect addition to the mix. Test audiences agreed. Rachel Leigh Cook was a tad weak but not bad. Same goes for the actress who played her mother. McGinley as Con McCarty was both funny and enjoyable. Loved his character the most. Even though it's not a loyal remake, it is a fun and hip remake.\", \"This film undeservedly took a bashing when it was released and since then Get Carter '71 fans have insistently tried to bury it. However, in the 7 years since it's release I've come to realize that this isn't the worst film ever made. It's not even the worst remake ever made.  This film felt more like a stylized version of the gritty Michael Caine version which has earned its classic status in British cinema. The one thing I liked about this version versus the original was the fact that they humanized the characters. I could relate more to Carter even if that wasn't the point of the original story. The original film gives us a Jack Carter who will attack or kill anyone he suspects was part of the murder of his brother thus turning it into a hate filled, vengeance fest. There's no character development in Michael Caine's version which explains the campy, cult status it has earned as being a low budget gangster film full of ruthless characters. It was hard to care about any of the characters in the original and films usually lose points with me when I cannot fully connect with a character. If they don't care why should I as a viewer? Regardless of we were supposed to like a character or not in the original I feel that's an essential ingredient for a good film.  With that being said the film still suffers it's drawbacks. Mainly the stylized vision of this version will turn off fans of the original from the start. Also, the main villain wasn't convincing enough and I'm talking about Alan Cumming's character. The ending was too hunky-dory but Mickey Rourke was exceptional in the short amounts of time he was on screen.  This film is entertaining while not standing up to the 1971 classic, it does stand up as a good Stallone film and a worthy edition to an action fans DVD collection.\", \"...but it never did! It's actually good. Some very good acting, some very good, well-developed characters and a plot that you actually get involved in and care about. At first, it keeps looking like the kind of movie that's going to beat you over the head with every simplistic character motivation or plot point, but it doesn't. It actually leaves a lot unexplained, to great affect. Even the third act, in which many movies, even good ones, fall completely to pieces, is solid here. The 4.6 rating is really not fair, and is more about how much some people just DESPISE Stallone and anything he does, no matter what. I generally hate about 80% of what Stallone puts out, but when I like him, I like him a lot. And in this movie, he's good. Mickey Rourke is good (starts out strong but gets a little two dimensional as the movie develops, but that's OK, he's still fascinating to watch). John C. McGinley is John C. McGinley-good. Rachel Leigh Cook is very good, and actually great and very moving in one scene in particular. It's really not a bad movie at all.\", \"The Y2K Get Carter remake of the great 1971 film of the same name is puzzling to me. First of all, why anyone would want to remake a great film is beyond me. Second of all, if one is going to remake a great film (assuming one is trying make another great film to go along side of it) they might as well actually remake it well! But no, the producers go and get a director who never made a good film previously to this stint on the resurrected Get Carter (and think of a living dead sort-of resurrection), Stephen T. Kay. Way to go. Kay brings to the film a sort of FX-TV look, complete with a neo-MTV soundtrack. Yeah, put that in your pipe and smoke it....   Then they get writer David McKenna to write the screenplay. McKenna had the Oscar-nominated American History X under his belt at that point (though the Oscar-nom went to actor Edward Norton), but he followed up with the critically-panned Body Shots. One would think that would have been a red flag, but hey, luckily I do not have to defend the choice. So under McKenna's pen we go from a brutal crime flick about one man's darkness in the 1971 film to a crime flick still, but now Carter is the Angel of Justice or something and far less dimensional. On top of that, the story is changed so we have a different ending that is FAR less powerful than that of the original Get Carter. The dialogue gets murdered as well. For example, we go from Caine's Carter's intimidating \\\"like p**s-holes in the snow\\\" description of Eric's eyes to Stallone's Carter's laughable \\\"like cat-p**s in the snow\\\" description of Cyrus' (whoever that is) eyes. \\\"Cat-p**s\\\"? are you freakin' kidding me? How did we get to \\\"cat-p**s\\\"?   Then we get to the cast which, in my opinion, is hit-or-miss. But hey, at least we have a couple of hits. Miranda Richardson does well in her supporting role as Gloria Carter, Jack's sister in law; Rachael Leigh Cook also does a good job in her supporting role as Doreen Carter, Jack's niece; and I really think that Sylvester Stallone did the best job he could with the material as Jack Carter. Sure, he is no Caine, but who is? Stallone relatively holds his own throughout the film despite being surrounded by a mostly horrid cast. John C. McGinley, Alan Cumming, and Mickey Rourke are all painfully bad. You know the feeling you get when an actor is so bad you feel embarrassed for them? These three supporting performances in Get Carter are perfect examples of this!   Then we have Michael Caine - of whom I honestly cannot decide whether or not gives a good performance because I cannot get over what a backstabbing Judas he is for being apart of this film in the first place! Caine has admitted that he does a lot of films just for the cash, and this has got to be one of those jobs, it just has to be!   Run, don't walk, to the great original 1971 Get Carter film instead of this atrocity.\", \"I wanted to love \\\"Get Carter\\\". Because I love mobster movies, movies that take place in Vegas, and Stallone is one of my all time fav actors and him playing a hitman, in Vegas was a match made in heaven, but the film still sucked. Had some good action scenes but it was all still a bore. I did found myself looking at my watch a lot and wondering when this was going to be over. Here is a little info about the story. Sly plays a bad-ass hitman who is a former prisoner too and he finds out that his brother has been killed and now he is pissed and he will make the killer pay. Been there. Done that. But hey, the acting is still much better than a lot of other crappy action movies. Sly and crew will impress you with the acting and you may think it is a shame that great actors like that wasted their time making this movie, The flick made Sly look like Rocky again because he was made out to be very tough. Which was cool because I was glad to see Rocky come out again. Somewhere in Sly's body, Rocky is in there lurking who comes out every now and then to make us cheer. And I don't blame Sly, Mike, or Mick for this bad movie. They are all great actors and did great in this, the story itself just sucked. Course, if you ever are at home on a Friday night and your just typing away at the computer and the TV is on and you just want something to listen to, \\\"Get Carter\\\" is not a bad choice. Because every now and then you may just turn away from the puter' to see what Sly and the boys are up to doing. And \\\"Get Carter\\\" was much better than Sly's newest film, \\\"Driven\\\".  \", \"OK, the original version of this movie wasn't imposing so why bother to remake it? The storyline is Stallone plays a Luca Brazi type mob enforcer who heads home for his brother's funeral. When he gets home he learns some of his old cronies were responsible so you know the drill....revengeeeee! I say the only reason this movie is watchable besides the usual Stallone delivery is because of Rachel Leigh Cook...this was back when she was in her true prime and she is GORGEOUS in the movie.  The movie is more cerebral than action so if you're into that sort of thing give it a look, otherwise better bring some pillows and a blanket.  The highlight of the movie is the opening scene where Carter beats the shyt out of the dude and Con tries to talk him out of it 4 out of 10\", \"I simply do not get what certain people have against this movie. Sure, it's not a cinematic breakthrough, but it is very sharp, smart and focused. Jack Carter's brother, Richie, dies under mysterious circumstances. Jack goes back to his home town to check things out and perhaps find out the truth. What he finds is not all that easy to get to grips with.  This is not your usual run of the mill revenge movie. The story has some layers to it and I am surprised to see that people did not appreciate that. Jack Carter is not a good guy. He is a bad man working in bad town doing bad things. Always was a bad guy. But he reaches a moment in his life when the things that take place between him and his boss's girl Audrey, the things that he finds out about his brother and his brother's family, all of them act as a catalyst. For once in his life he tries to set things right. How does he do that? By doing what he knows to do. He does bad things. The guys he goes up against are a little a out of the reach of the law. To wait for justice to set things right is not a concept Jack is familiar with. The only things he knows is to take care of his own dirty laundry. And at the moment his life is his dirty laundry. He was not there for his brother, for his niece and he missed some oportunities... Time to set things right. But he does only bad things in this movie. He kills people by shooting them, by throwing them out of the balcony, by beating them up in the elevator. WHY? Because these are the same things that would happen to him if he let his guard down.  Great acting performances form most guys in the movie. Stallone seems to have found some serious acting genes within himself. This is some of his best work and his best is very good. Not only for the genre. Although when looking back at Oscar (his 1991 comedy), D-Tox (a very underrated movie) and Copland I have to say that this is not a one off. No sir. When the script, the director and the rest of the cast are good he can act big time. Michael Caine made a very good movie called get Carter back in 1971. I love that movie and is always one of my favorites to watch on Turner Classic Movies. The remake, I felt, is just as good. Sure it has the sort of usual happy ending, but that is just the American Way of ending action movies. They love a hero. Mickey Rourke, Alan Cummings, Michael Caine and Rachael Leigh-Cook are very good in this one. Somehow Miranda Richardson seemed a little over the top in her angry widow/mother scenes.  Michael Caine acted in this one simply because he knew it was good. The movie could have been done without him, without a doubt. But he did it because unlike other remakes, this one is just as good as the original. It has it's own style, a somewhat different story and a happier ending. Otherwise, they are two very similar movies. And even if some consider the original as better, they should not write this one off. The layers are there, you just have to dig. And this only because the producers did not get this movie. The director, the cast, everybody got this movie and knew what they were making except for the producers who seem to have been thinking of another movie. Michael Caine seems to have given his seal off approval to Stallone's acting in this one. The producers wanted a classic 80's action movie. At least that's what I feel. So, this is a very good movie. Just as good (or almost as good, depending on how you look at it) as the original. It has great acting, sharp directing, nice car chase scenes, nice action scenes, some great moments, some wonderful music, a simple yet effective storyline that keeps you guessing and wanting to see more. And as someone put it, crap like XXX, The Fast and The Furious (+sequel, at least is has some cars), Charlie's Angels (+sequel. could not even watch) and other such teen-hormone-slang-flash-driven movies have a higher rating, IT SIMPLY ISN'T RIGHT!!!!!! 7.5/10\", \"For some unknown reason, the industry 'suits' have decided to black-list Sylvester Stallone, not giving him large leading roles, and when they give him a role, they refuse to heavily market his films. This trend started, I believe, sometime during the early 90s, probably after his last big hit, \\\"Cliffhanger.\\\" Nevertheless, Stallone has continued to make films, most of them actually pretty good.  That said, \\\"Get Carter\\\" is probably one of Stallone's better films of the last ten years (I think it's second to \\\"Cop Land\\\"). He portrays his role as the 'financial adjuster' (as he described it) Jack Carter. The remainder of the supporting cast, including Mickey Rourke, Rachel Leigh Cook, John C. McGinley, Alan Cumming and Michael Caine, each deliver convincing performances, conveying their characters' emotions with amazing quality.  I really noticed the way the film's editing and photography changed towards the end of the film, after beating up McCarty (McGinley) in the elevator. The way the film swiftly cuts ahead a couple of seconds is simply spectacular to watch. The many odd photography angles describe the uncertainty of the scenes, and make me feel unsure as well.  Living in the Seattle area, seeing the great landmarks I see every day on the screen is quite something else. And for the record, it doesn't rain nearly as much here as people think.

A lot of people really liked Good Will Hunting. But seriously please, great film making, not even close, and let's put the blame where it belongs... in the writing.  Now, I know they won an oscar for it, and boy did they look good emoting on the screen. But Good Will Hunting is an ABC after school special with lots of cursing in it, and a slightly bigger budget.  What this movie does show, is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take manure, feed it to you, and make you believe your eating bon bons. And that's exactly what the studio did with the film. They created such high faluttin buzz around it, that people believed, and wanted to believe it so much --- that they saw brilliance where there was none.  Now, I know some people think it's a great movie, I don't think it's a horribly bad movie, I like to compare it to more in the middle of the road movies, and also to some great Made for TV movies (although, not HBO films, HBO films are unusually better than Good Will Hunting would ever be.) It's just a nice, little film, with some good performances, Robin Williams was not good in it, they just gave him the oscar cause the'd been itching to do it for a while.

Like when Robin Williams' character (sorry I forgot his role's name) was telling Hunting repeatedly \\\"It's not your fault\\\" (oh Lord, just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps). I couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters. Many people sob for Hollywood manufactured characters they can't even relate to (think Titanic; Yuck!)... but it really only made me cringe and want to get out of the theatre. I guess I simply refuse to be psychically and emotionally manipulated by all this.  Folks it's not me who's being condescending ... those characters are, and for no good reason because they're unreal. Worse yet, nothing is new or surprising. Even Robin Williams' character is all cliched.  I gave it 1 out of 10.

A BEAUTIFUL MIND wasn`t up to much in my opinion ( FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved the Oscar that year ) while GOOD WILL HUNTING had several awards lavished on it undeservedly  First off is the script . When I attended film school I was told GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right . This movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it`s very very slow . If you wrote an unsolicited script like this the script reader would have given up on it by page 15  Structure aside the idea of a member of the American underclass being some sort of intellectual god doesn`t really ring true . Ask yourself this : If he`s the cleverst character in the movie how come he`s gone through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities ? Not one single teacher from his childhood noticed his gift ? Highly unlikely as is the fact he`s read so much mind expanding litrature . And if Will`s so clever how come he`s so oblivous of what happens to young good looking boys in American prisons ?  But it`s the casting that let much of the film down . You want to get a couple of actors to play rough tough Irish gang members ? Let`s get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck which is like getting Russell Crowe to play a pacifist or Charles Bronson to play a liberal do gooder . I failed to be convinced by the foul mouthed Damon and Affleck as they strutted about smacking people in the chops and couldn`t help thinking that even though they wrote the script the parts should have been awarded to different actors , after all Billy Bob Thornton has written screenplays for films he hasn`t been cast in and the same criteria should have been applied here  There are some good points to the movie . Robin Williams is excellent as the man who tries to show Will his potential and also very good is Stellan Skarsgard who is quite simply one of the greatest character actors to stepped foot outside of Europe and despite my previous criticism of the script there is quite a moving piece of dialogue at the park as Williams character explains to Will what he has seen in life  But I`ve got to repeat that there`s less plus points than negatives to this movie and I`ve got to agree with the people who`ve said GOOD WILL HUNTING is boring and unconvincing\", \"Enormous suspension of disbelief is required where Will's \\\"genius\\\" is concerned. Not just in math--he is also very well read in economic history, able to out-shrink several shrinks, etc etc. No, no, no. I don't buy it.

Among other problems...real genius (shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is, and whether it deserves such mindless homage) doesn't simply appear /ex nihilo/.

Everything finally comes to a head at his 10-year high school reunion. The problem was that by the time Blank got to the reunion I had stopped caring. Frankly, I found this movie a drag from start to finish.  It had potential. There was a reasonably good cast, headed by Cusack and Dan Aykroyd, playing Grocer, his arch-rival in the hit-man business, along with Minnie Driver as Debi, Blank's high school sweetheart who he stood up on prom night, and a limited role for Alan Arkin as Dr. Oatman, Blank's psychologist. That fairly talented cast never really seemed to come together, though. The drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked real humour. What I thought had the most potential to be a comedic storyline was Grocer's proposal for a hit man's union, but aside from becoming a bit of a running joke, the idea never really got developed. As for the romance, one wondered why Debi would even think of letting this guy back into her life.  There were a handful of chuckles, but nothing really caught me and held me and I spent most of the movie wondering whether this thing was ever going to start to click. It never did - not for me, at least. 2/10\", \"Grosse Pointe Blank was really quite a below average film. Its hit man theme is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a hit man thriller. The acting is very normal. The performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters seeming very 'eccentric' and that really annoyed me. The whole reunion and the 'Wow, I haven't seen you in 10 years!' element is extremely cheesy and many scenes just drag on, especially nearer the end when they are at the actual reunion party and the characters are going through each of their former classmates one by one greeting them. It just all seemed very tacky, pointless and was poorly executed.   Dan Akroyd's role as a 'rival' assassin is very sparse. He only seems to appear once at the very beginning and right at the very end in a 'final show down' which is hugely hyped up but doesn't deliver at all.  The soundtrack is also very mediocre. The bulk of the songs that are in this film are straight out of the 1980's and with the exception of two or three, are very bad. Hearing duff songs over quite a duff film just adds to the negativity that surrounds this film.  I could go on and on about how little things were annoying and were just very bad such as the very few action sequences that came and went very quickly, the lack of character development and how poorly the whole thing was constructed in that department, the way that half the time you forget that Cusak's character is even a hit man at all as the element is so non-existent.  Even the way the comedy thinks it's funny; but it isn't. I didn't laugh once during this movie. Sure, maybe I smirked now and again but my only REAL feel good point was when I realised the movie was nearly over!

Indeed, the movie hackers breaks at least two dozen fundamental pieces of computer knowledge that anybody even moderately trained could catch.

The computer operating systems are more like Tron then what they really should be, which is a bunch of Windows or Unix machines with boring information displayed in a pedestrian and boring manner on regular CRT's.

Hackers is a high minded film about the intricacy of Hacker subculture in the mid-90s. It's about people living on the fringe of society, who express themselves through a connection to the electronic world.  The storyline is simple, a young man is found guilty on his 11th birthday of using a virus to infect multiple network systems and causing them to crash. Subsequently, he is put on a probation that restricts him from owing or operating a computer & touch tone telephone. Fast forward to his 18th birthday, and after a broken family, a move to New York with his mother, and a change of schools; he falls into a group of people who live as \\\"Hackers\\\". After one of them inadvertently copies incriminating data from a Mineral Company computer, the company's head of computer security hatches a plan to track them down. With a couple of plot twists, and a Good/Evil story, its an easy watch. Angelina Jolie even briefly gets her nipples onto film for the first time.  The downside comes in the fact that the characters are very one dimensional. It's hard to engage with them, as they all seem to be trying so hard to be interesting and edgy. The computer jargon thrown into the dialogue is appropriate for the time frame of the movie, but it really has not aged well. Its a mess of bad clich\\u00e9 and cheesy one-liners that creates a nasty cringe factor.  Using New York as a backdrop, the film is shot nicely, giving a gritty urban feel, and allowing it to seem larger in scope than the sum of its parts. However, with wooden acting & delivery, the characters seem to fade into the background, not taking advantage of the settings they find themselves in.  The low rating is more for the poor acting, lackluster dialogue and cut'n'paste storyline. This, though, does not mean its a bad film. Hackers has a great soundtrack, with quirky tracks that work perfectly for the material. It also seems to work on a visceral level, providing entertainment and laughs that it wasn't really intending.

After being burnt to a smoking pile of bones at the end of Halloween II, Myers and Loomis ended the series there for 7 years. When Myers was madly asked for from fans, the Akkads decided to make Myers come back in style. So why didn't he? Well folks, here's where the spoilers start. You have been warned...  Myers didn't die (? His fiery skull was seen at the end of part II), he just fell into a coma for 10 years. He is about to be transferred from the sanitarium he has been housed in when, surprise surprise, he breaks out. He tails his 7 year old niece Jamie and plots to kill her. Lee Curtis intelligibly jumped ship after II, so they had to bump her off in a car crash with her husband. That is all that is mentioned. No bloody explanation or anything.

Yes, you read that right. Pleasence makes a return as Loomis, which is impossible as he was in the middle of the explosion at the end of II. The only blemish on his face is a not-so-severe burn mark. But the thing that ruined 4 for me was Myers. The mask is a poorly customised Will Shatner mask which isn't scary at all, and Myers is an average killer. Yea, no leaping out of shadows and scares here, just him walking about and turning menacingly. Jesus, even that jerk Ghostface from Scream woulda done a better job.

It has since spawned 7 sequels, a remake, a whole mess of imitations and every year around Halloween when they do those 'Top 10 Scariest Movies' lists it's always on there. That's quite amazing for a film that was made on a budget of around $300,000 and featured a then almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent. I could go on and on, but the big question here is: How does the film hold up today? And all I can say to that is, fantastically!   Pros: A simple, but spooky opening credits sequence that really sets the mood. An unforgettable and goosebump-inducing score by director/co-writer John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Great cinematography. Stellar direction by Carpenter who keeps the suspense high, gets some great shots, and is careful not to show too much of his villain. Good performances from the then mostly unknown cast. A good sense of humor. Michael Myers is one scary, evil guy. A lot of eerie moments that'll stay with you. The pace is slow, but steady and never drags. Unlike most other slasher films, this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a big body count.  Cons: Probably not nearly as scary now as it was then. Many of the goofs really stand out.   Final thoughts: I want to start out this section by saying this is not my favorite film in the series. I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's really how I feel. Despite that it truly is an important film that keeps reaching new generations of film buffs. And just because it's been remade for a new generation doesn't mean it'll be forgotten. No way, no how.  My rating: 5/5\", \"I have only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. Being made almost 30 years ago I thought the scary moments would be rather tame. Boy was I wrong. There are some great moments that sent shivers down my spine. Even the acting was great, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Pleasance was superb.  On the downside it can be rather slow to start but once it gets going there is no stopping it. It makes all the copycats, e.g. Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream look very tame. I can't really say it is Carpenter's best because I have not seen many of his, the only one I can remember of his is Starman (I think he made it). Halloween is the crowning achievement of the horror genre.\", \"Every now and then a movie advertises itself as scary or frightening, though they usually aren't. Most modern horror movies fit into this category.  Then there are those movies that don't simply cause the tension and adrenaline to pump through your veins harder than usual. They actually frighten you to a level that you've never experienced.  \\\"Halloween\\\" is such a film. It takes so many risks that would make most movie producers cringe. But nearly all of them work. \\\"Halloween\\\" is awe-inspiring in its simplicity, and terrifying as a whole.  The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is babysitting some kids on Halloween night, while a madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago. Of course, the madman, later known as Michael Myers, begins killing the local teenage population, and eventually he comes after Laurie.  Sounds familiar, right? Just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and gobs of gore. Not a chance.  I think James Berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of \\\"Halloween:\\\" \\\"Because of its title, Halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late-1970s and early-1980s. However, while Halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre, it is not a member...\\\"   He has a point, and for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it's downright terrifying, whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gore-fests (one could argue that many recent ones are tongue-in-cheek, but most of those fail as well). Second, there is almost no violence (very little of which is bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary, and he relies very little on it (actually, the body count is pretty low). In fact, one can argue that this isn't really a horror movie, at least not by todays standards of having the most deaths that can be crammed into a single movie, each gorier and more sadistic than the last. He relies on ideas for scares, and also skill. Third, while some of the characters may do stupid things (that sometimes seal their fate), they don't do them because they're dumb. The characters are real people, so instead of thinking that the characters die because they're idiots, we're frightened because they're making a mistake.  One of the main reasons why \\\"Halloween\\\" is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that it's real. Nothing is hard to swallow in this film. There's no supernatural, there's no ridiculously creative plot elements, or \\\"inventive\\\" murders, or whatnot. Instead, all the set pieces and camera work (save the opening sequence) are simple. Carpenter just sets the camera in place and says action. What we get is the feeling that we're actually seeing a murder take place right in front of us.  Horror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because in order for something to be scary, everything has to be perfect, and ideas never work twice. It's a hit or miss game, which is why if I were to tell you all the good ideas that Carpenter has (which I'm not), they'd seem primitive (particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the years).  Acting here is not a plus point because it doesn't need to be. This is a movie about scary ideas, not a movie about dramatic, conflicted characters. The actors act like real people, not characters from a story. Nothing more. The exception to this is whoever plays The Shape, or later known as Michael Myers. It can be scary to have a person say nothing and simply kill, but it's hard to pull off (and even harder to keep people from asking why). But the guy pulls it off, and the result is terrifying.  This is Carpenter's movie through and through. He directed it, co-wrote it, co-produced it, and wrote the chilling score of it. This is a man of brilliance, and his later movie \\\"The Thing\\\" supports this statement, though The Thing is not as scary as \\\"Halloween.\\\" Unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished, as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers \\\"recognize your potential.\\\" As good as this film is, it's not without flaws. The famous opening scene is disturbing, but not very scary. And not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie. It's not that it's bad, it's just that there's no good reason to fear \\\"The Shape.\\\" Luckily, Carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience. While there's no intimacy in this relationship, it fits the purpose. We grow to know the characters, but not so much that it's disheartening when they die. But once the film gets to Halloween night, that's when Carpenter kicks things into high gear and it NEVER stops until you get to the end.  While \\\"Halloween\\\" may be flawed, it is only slightly so. It is an immensely terrifying film, and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies. Be warned though, this movie will scare the living hell out of you!\", \"In 1978 a phenomenon began. The release of John Carpenter's \\\"Halloween\\\" got people queueing around the block to witness the evil that is Michael Meyers. The critics loved it, the world loved it, it was imitated, and has gone down as one of the greatest movies in cinematic history.  plot: 15 years after a murder took place, four friends (all females) are babysitting(and having it on with their boyfriends) on Halloween night. After escaping from a hospital the night before, Michael myers Returns to his home town to stalk these people. He murders 3 of them silently and subtlety. He does not speak. He walks slowly. He hides....  Only one of the friends escapes, after being saved by Doctor Loomis (Michael's pursuer and doctor)   There is one reason why Halloween works so well. Simplicity. We don't know where Michael is, we don't know why he kills, and he frightens us. They're the only reasons why we are afraid.  John carpenter wrote the movie, and directed. He builds unbearable tension throughout the story, and scares to such a degree, that sometimes we cannot watch. And the climax is truly startling.  As horror, this is essential. It is terrifying and well acted. It is also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a human. A force that cannot be denied.  The sequels focused too much around Michael and his \\\"history\\\". This movie focuses on the fear of the unknown. Perhaps that's why this thing is a masterpiece.\", \"There are two movie experiences I will always cherish. The first was seeing \\\"Star Wars\\\" for the first time at the age of 10 with my little brother. A close second is sneaking into Halloween at the Tripple Plex with my good friend, Trevor, in late October 1978. Halloween left me breathless, speechless, and downright scared. Everyone knows the story. Young Michael Myers decides to kill his sister on Halloween 1963. He escapes a mental hospital 15 years later to return to Haddofield to wreck havoc once again. He spots Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis), a shy senior who enjoys babysitting, and begins stalking her. Her partying friends across the street are killed, one-by-one as Michael sets his plot to get her. Ironically, the young boy she tends on Halloween is afraid of the \\\"Boogeman,\\\" and can see him outside. During the murder spree, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) works hard to find Michael before he unleashes his fury. He has no proof, no evidence, just a hunch he has to sell to Sheriff Bracket (Charles Cyphers). As the plot unfolds, you have a suspense-driven movie instead of a cheap thrill scare. Alfred Hitchcock once said, \\\"You can have four men at a table playing cards and they don't know there is a bomb and it goes off. That is a cheap thrill. However, put four men at a table who discover a bomb and discuss what to do about it--then it doesn't go off, then you have suspense.\\\" Director John Carpenter takes that advice to the hilt in Halloween. The audience will see glimpses of him outside, watching, stalking his victims. We gasp. Will he kill her? When will he kill her? Then, Michael disappears. Carpenter also uses the suspense in lieu of special effects that usually highlight the gore. This movie has little blood, but still provides good scares. One of the best scenes is Michael lifting Bob off the ground. He rears the knife back as it glints off the moonlight, then he drives it. All you hear is a loud thud, then the audience sees Bob's feet drop lifelessly. Carpenter was the first to use a vantage point from the scene of the killer. This also peaks our audience. What will he do? What's going on inside his mind? Finally, Carpenter's hauntingly masterful score adds to the tension. Moreover, the tandem screen writing he did with Debra Hill gives us a story which develops characters we care about. The teens are not \\\"party mad,\\\" but merely going through the rebellious angst of teenage wasteland. Finally, there is some decent acting in this \\\"B,\\\" low-budget thriller. Nick Castle who plays \\\"the Shape\\\" (Michael) adds something to the mindless killer. It is cold, merciless, and without any pathology. Moreover, the personality does everything the same way. He kills only when trapped, or to set up a trap. He splits the victims apart. He also relies on brute strength. And that mask used (a bleached William Shatner mask) gives an impression of something that has no soul or emotion. While Pleasance is melodramatic in his deadpan monologues, he comes across as someone scared, desperate, and determined. It made me wonder if he represented modernism's fading attempt to explain evil. The crown jewel, though, is Jamie Lee Curtis' debut. She plays the Laurie character as someone scared, but also determined and strong who fights back. The end is one that left me speechless. This was the first concept of an indestructible serial killer who could not be stopped. Movies like Star Wars have the advantage that it can be enjoyed numerous times. Halloween, and other scary movies, though, do not have that advantage. So if we could erase our minds of the first time we see a movie to experience it again as fresh and new, Halloween would be the movie I would choose.\", \"It was \\\"The Night HE Came Home,\\\" warned the posters for John Carpenter's career-making horror classic. Set in a small American town, Halloween centerers around serial killer Michael Myers' attempts to track down his sister Laurie Strode, and in the process eliminates all her friends in rather brutal ways...leaving poor Laurie to fight against the seemingly indestructible Michael. This plot out-line inspired countless horror knock-offs throughout the 80s, 90s and continues to do so today, as well as a poorly received 2007 remake. The difference between them, and this, is, quite simply, that \\\"Halloween\\\" is the best.  Made on a very modest, tight budget...Halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned the sub-genre of \\\"sexually promiscuous-teens getting stalked by a knife/axe/chainsaw/ wielding psycho\\\".\", \"With a simplistic story and an engaging heroine, this was the horror movie that started it all. John Carpenter brings to life a nail-biting nightmare on Halloween night, when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis in her debut, career defining role) and her mischievous friends plan a night of sneaky fun- only to cross paths with a relentless psychopath from hell.   Michael Myers has escaped from a nearby insane aslyum...having slaughtered his sister fifteen years earlier, he is now back in Haddonfield, the sleepy Illinois town where his murder took place. Once he sets his eyes on Laurie after she drops off a package to the abandoned house where he lived, he begins to stalk and terrorize her, turning her night of fun into terror as he picks off anyone in his path to get to her.  Beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this moody horror flick scary... with the long gloomy shots it constantly feels as if you're being stalked by the maniacal serial killer himself. Myers is hidden well until fully revealed at the exciting conclusion.  Although \\\"Halloween\\\" is certainly outdated, it is by no means less chilling. The idea alone is goose bump inducing, and this little shocker is one of the most famous and memorable horror movies ever made to this day... it spawned seven sequels and eventually Rob Zombie's equally scary remake, and it set a new standard for horror that still exists today.\", \"As I mentioned previously, John Carpenter's 1978 classic is one of the first two movies I can remember seeing and being heavily influenced by (the other being the classic Conan the Barbarian). It so truly scared me that the only monster under my bed was Michael Meyers, whom I eventually befriended (imaginary friend) to keep him from killing me in my sleep. Now that is terror for a 10 year old.  It is a horror classic and I am sure my modest review will not do it the justice it deserves. The most surprising thing of all is that the movie still works, perhaps not in the guttural reaction but more of a cognitive possibility or immediate subconscious. This all could happen. It isn't in the realm of impossibility or located in a foreign country (as most modern horror is, i.e. Hostel, Touristas, Cry Wolf, Saw,etc). At times it is graphic while the rest is relegated to our imaginations. I believe it is this element that keeps people terrified or at the very least wary of going outside at night with the signature soundtrack still vivid in their head. It still works because we can substitute implied or tertiary killing with anything more terrifying that our mind can create. So we ourselves are contributing to our own fears and anxiety.  Carpenter weaves a simple story about an everyday, middle class, suburban and relatively benign child who snaps on Halloween and kills his sister. He then spends the next 15 years in an institution (which we thankfully do not experience) only to escape and return to his hometown, the infamous Haddonfield. On his way he kills and kills. The child's name is Michael Meyers, though he is not a person. John Carpenter uses Michael Meyers as a metaphor against the implied safety of middle class suburbia. In the bastion of American safety and security, chaos can still strike.  Michael ceased to be a person once he killed. He is not a serial killer, human being or psychopath. He is as unstoppable force. The generic overalls, bleached-white Shatner mask, and lack of any dialog other then some breathing, helps to dehumanize and complete Michael's generification. This is the source of all his power. He is faceless, speechless and unremarkable in any way other than as a source of unrelenting chaos. This is helped by the cinematography (post card effect), a lack of information/motivation/explanation and the veteran narrative experience of Donald Pleasence (Dr. Loomis). His over the top performance and uneasiness sells \\\"the Shape\\\". This is also the first film performance by Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, the innocent girl who deters chaos in the face of overwhelming odds (at least for a little bit).   Though this isn't the first movie of this new niche of horror films (Black Christmas came out 4 years earlier), it is the most successful and does not diminish upon reviewing. If you haven't been scared by horror movies in a long time (like me), this will probably make the hairs on the back of your head tingle at the first chords of the signature soundtrack. I highly recommend this movie as a must see horror movie and as one of the pinnacles of John Carpenter's career.\", \"There is no doubt that Halloween is by far one of the best films ever not only in its genre but also outside.I love the films creepy atmosphere like the whole it could happen here sort of situation makes it scary to think about.Also to imagine if you were ever in this situation what would you do.This is a movie that i enjoy watching highly, especially around Halloween time.John Carpenter is a very professional directer i love a lot of his other films, but there is no doubt that his best known movie is the film Halloween.Oh and if your thinking about watching the Rob Zombie remake don't.It is pure crap and a true Halloween fan would like the 1978 John Carpenter version better.Michael Myers is one of the coolest slasher killers in any film, and is a very well known one.So by all means go see this masterpiece you will really like it.\", \"Halloween is a film I have to get out and watch every time it's THAT day of the year.I even watch it sometimes when it's not the holiday!!!This film is SO great.Jamie Lee Curtis is an actress I can never stop loving.This movie might be old,but the story line still gets me right there every time,and the acting was absolutely fantastic!!!Although I have not seen the remake,I feel already that it was TOTALLY unnecessary.I think Rob Zombie should have NEVER remade such a classic.What kills me though,is to know that there are some people out there who have seen the remake without even hearing of the original.I am getting furious just thinking about it!!!!!!This movie was great,and it will always be remembered in history as a classic.\", \"It took me time to really appreciate John Carpenter's Halloween. As a kid, I remember I really enjoyed the sequels, especially The Return of Michael Myers, which I still think is the best Halloween sequel. But I thought the first one was slow and took way too much time to get to the point\\u00ad. I watched it a couple of times recently and I know now I was wrong. Today I truly understand this film, the meaning it has, the whole feeling of this horror masterpiece. It's not about blood and gore. It's not about naked chicks and lame jokes. It's about the worst night in Laurie Strode's short life. It's about the night his demented brother comes back home to finish what he started 15 years ago. This movie is meant to be scary and I think it succeeds very well. It's also one of the first slasher movies, a horror sub-genre that I always loved. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, creepy music and talented young actors, such as Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role. Need I say more? Anyone who's never seen it, horror fan or not, should do his cinematic homework right now. Very highly recommended!\", \"Some spoilers If you are a big horror movie fan, then you will know that Halloween paved the way for many slasher films. Often imitated, never duplicated, this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made, if not THE scariest.  I actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (don't ask me why). I honestly saw the other 7 movies before seeing this one, that's just how it worked out. But I would have to say this one blows all the others away. It is genuinely frightening, and seeing Michael pop out from behind a bush or walk around in the dark sends a chill down your spine. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael stabs a guy, and leans his head to one side. It is one of the eeriest images in movie history.  Later slashers, such as the Friday the 13th films, were more fun and less intense than this movie. I do like the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this movie alone is better than all the F13 movies. Michael Myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic, you could imagine a crazed guy like him going around killing people. I admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights.  What's great about this movie is that it doesn't rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience. It is just pure terror. It's too bad the later films of the series swayed from this one, because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come.\", \"The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost. I expected a gore fest, but instead got to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with my head to a chilling soundtrack (it's actually my ringer at the moment :P). The fact that I couldn't predict when he'd kill and when he'd disappear was a major plus in my book. Predictable horror movies bore me. Now, I know the storyline had some discrepancies, but, if you're like me, you don't even notice them until long after the movie's over and you're laying in bed mauling over the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in motion. Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. It's one of my all time favorite theatrical scores, so I was very happy to hear that Rob Zombie is leaving it untouched in his remake. Speaking of the remake, I read a very comprehensive article on it and, now that I know that Mr. Zombie reveres John Carpenter, I have high hopes for his take on this classic. This movie is great for any time you have a craving for a spine tingling, but it's the perfect addition, opener, finale, you name it for an All Hallow's Eve movie marathon. :)\", \"Classic, highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director Carpenter and star Curtis.  Seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on Halloween.  Halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! Carpenter's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt! The direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors, that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy. Carpenter well-times his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling, that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage! Plus, he is wise enough to give us some truly likable young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the more strong. Highest kudos also go to Carpenter's simple, yet frighteningly unnerving music score. In a sense, Halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film!  The cast is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter Laurie Strode, she's so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror films before breaking into bigger films. The great Donald Pleasants does a perfect performance as a Myer's doctor, who's desperate to capture him again. Supporting cast Loomis, Soles, Castle, and others are good too.  So like its own villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill. It is a MUST for all genre fans!  **** out of ****\", \"This film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding, the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be! Actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance you were fantastic as Dr Loomis, he made the film even better. Without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also superb as our beloved scream queen! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house, which of course is one of the films best scenes. She gives a tremendous performance. I loved this film since it scared me like hell back when I seen it in the very early 80's and I still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that he is there, is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true. We all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this. Death at any turn. Halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way. Horror should be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. It's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. As well as Psycho's superb storyline, both of which I adore, I believe there formats are the best horror has to offer. To me Halloween and Psycho are the best films I have ever seen and I will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.\", \"This was a movie that I had heard about all my life growing up, but had never seen it until a few years ago. It's reputation truly proceeded it. I knew of Michael Myers, had seen the mask, saw commercials for all of the crummy sequels that followed. But I was growing up during the decade where Jason and Freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game, and never thought much of the Halloween franchise. Boy, how I was being cheated with cheap knock offs.  Halloween is a genuinely terrifying movie. Now, by today's standards, it isn't as graphic and visceral, but this film delivers on all the other levels most horror movies fail to achieve today. The atmosphere that John Carpenter creates is so creepy, and the fact that it is set in a quaint, mid-west town is a testament to his ability. The lighting effects are down right horrifying, with \\\"The Shape\\\" seemingly appearing and disappearing into the shadows at will. The simple yet brutally effective music score only adds to the suspense.  The performances by all the players are well done, with specific nods to Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Ms. Curtis is such a good Laurie Strode because she is so likable and vulnerable. It is all the more frightening when she is being stalked by Michael Myers because the director and viewer have invested so much into her, we want her to survive and get away.  Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Loomis like a man on a mission, and it works well. He adds a sense of urgency to the predicament the town finds itself in because he knows what evil stalks their streets.  Overall, not only is Halloween a great horror movie, but also a great film. It works on many levels and draws the audience in and never lets up. This should be standard viewing for anyone wanting to experience a truly scary movie. And for an even more frightful time, try watching it alone with the lights off. Don't be surprised if you think you see \\\"The Shape\\\" lurking around in the shadows!\", \"John Carpenter's Halloween  Is it the greatest horror film of all time? no .. maybe not to everyone, but to me it is and always will be. The film is sheer genius and will always hold a very special place in my heart.   It's unfortunate I didn't get to see this film until twenty years after it's release, but even twenty years later after so many slasher copy cats had come and gone the film still gave the same impact as it must have done then. My father suggested before I go see Halloween H20 that I whip out and rent Halloween's 1 and 2 to get the full story, and after watching Halloween it was quite clear that it defined and set the Slasher Genre.  The film's plot is simple, In 1963 Michael Audrey Myers killed his sister Judith in cold blood with a large butcher knife. Incarcerated for fifteen years where he was treated by Dr. Sam Loomis, he escapes and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield where he begins stalking three young girls: Laurie Strode an innocent bookworm, Annie Brackett a tough talking sarcastic and Lynda Van Der Klok a beautiful and sexually vigorous young girl. Dr. Loomis tracks Michael here where he enlists the help of the town Sheriff Leigh Brackett whom remains skeptical of his story about the psychotic killer. Michael watches the girls mercilessly and begins killing them off one by one, until only sweet innocent Laurie is left who is the prime target on Michael's list.  The casting of this film was brilliant and all the actors and actresses gave top notch performances, Jamie Lee Curtis was stunning in her first film role as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance gave a thrilling performance with his small role as Loomis. Nick Castle who portrays Michael did an outstanding job as the soulless and evil killer, and his walk and body movements were perfect.  One of the great highlights of this film is it's chilling score done by John Carpenter himself who created one of the most recognizable horror themes known today. The Blue Lighting was creepy and effective and one of the great moments in this film is when young Laurie is cowering against a wall after seeing her dead friends, and in the shadows behind her Michael's face materializes before he strikes. Michael's mask was one of the thing's that sent chills down my spine the most, the white emotionless face worked perfectly.  What makes this film so great is that it is not a gory film unlike the cheesy Friday The 13th films, in fact there is little blood in this film at all and works instead on suspense and tension.   It became so clear that Halloween spawned movies like Friday The 13th and characters like Jason Voorhees, whom he is a mere rip off of Michael Myers.  To sum it up, I suggest you see this film at least once in your life as it is a landmark in film making and is without a doubt if not the greatest then one of the greatest horror films of all time.\", \"Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. He takes out his problems on his older sister, whom he murders at the beginning of the film. This is just the start of things to come from Michael Myers.  Donald Pleasance plays the doctor who's been studying Myers for years. He knows that something is different about him, something mysteriously evil. This evil will not be contained, and it cannot be stopped.  After an escape from an institution, Myers tracks down his younger sister. If he kills her, there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy. But he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way. He manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needs.  There have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting hacked to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer. But this one started it all, sort of. If you think about it, most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have Freddy Kruger or Jason chasing around half naked girls. Well, if it wasn't for Halloween, those characters wouldn't have haunted our dreams when we were children.  Halloween's director, John Carpenter, got a lot out of the horror movies of the '50s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late '70s. This films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer.  This film may seem clich\\u00e9 today, but back then there wasn't much out there like this. It's been copied from and ripped off of, but Halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie. It still gives you chills listening to Carpenter's thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy Michael Myers.\", \"I must admit, this is one of my favorite horror films of all time. The unique way that John Carpenter has directed this picture, opening the door to so many mock-genres, it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth. The sound, the menacing horror of Michael Meyers and the infamous scream of Jamie Lee Curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era. I love the music, I love the characters, the familiar yet spooky setting, the simplistic nature of the villain, and the random chaos of it all. There is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film, giving us a taste of Michael's true nature. Is he insane, or in some way just a very brilliant beast? That question may never be truly answered, but Carpenter gives us his 100% and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece.  John Carpenter is the master of horror. While lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were (see Ghosts of Mars), Halloween began his powerhouse of a career. This is his ultimate film. While he did release other greats, I will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights, beware when babysitting, and check behind closed doors, because you never knew where the evil would appear next. Carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves. With the power of his camera, he places these images of Meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you. I loved every scene in which we panned back and there was Michael, watching from the distance, without anyone the wiser. That was scary, yet utterly brilliant. I loved the scenes in which Carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air. There you would be, minding your own business, when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere. Like the characters, you too thought it was just a trick of the eye, but that is where Carpenter gets you, it isn't. Michael isn't a ghost, he is a human being (or at least we think), yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters. This leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism, but even without that, this is a spooky film.  Then, if you just didn't have enough of Michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house, Carpenter adds that chilling theme music. I still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind, constantly wondering if Meyers is looking at me through the window. Carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next. It is lethal, and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today's Horror Hollywood could muster. Carpenter's Halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year, with actual scares being replaced by Paris Hilton, you know that the quality isn't quite the same.  Finally, I would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling. The use of the \\\"clown\\\" mask sent shivers up my spine. The way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child's mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever! It completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film. You have the babysitter theme, you have the childish behavior which carries with Michael throughout the film, and you have the art talent of Carpenter all rolled into one. I could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film, but instead I would rather go watch it again. It is worth the repeat visit many times!   Overall, I think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history. Skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight Carpenter and the slasher film genre. This singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films, and still continues to be an influence on modern-day horror treats. The lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer, the powerful cinematography of the events (which normally doesn't amount to much in horror films), and the beauty of Jamie Lee Curtis is exactly what makes Halloween that film above the rest. Sure, Freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for Jason, but Michael is real, he is troubled, and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters. What can be better?   Grade: ***** out of *****\", \"Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. It's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance. It is a simple movie told very well. The music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores... If you haven't seen this movie yet, you must check it out. The cast is all terrific. I wish they had never made sequel after sequel. The first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She hasn't seemed to age (she's just as gorgeous today, without the hairdo and seventies clothes). The scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever!\", \"Halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep! It is in my opinion, the scariest movie of all time. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman ever! He was just so terrifying! What makes Halloween so special is that there was no special effects where you can tell how computer animated it is, this was on a low budget and had a one note score, yet managed to scare the Hell out of people. 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in '78.  It's about a boy Michael Myers, he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the mental institution. Dr. Sam Loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back, since he describes Michael as \\\"...pure evil. The blackest eyes, the Devil's eyes\\\". Michael is on a mission though, to kill his other sister, Laurie, played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis. She has to babysit on Halloween, while her friends are out partying and of course, we know the rules, they get it! But Laurie may stand a chance since she's the virgin. ;D   Halloween pays many homages to Psycho, we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, the daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is an absolute terrific movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock the doors, bolt your windows, and turn off the lights! \\\"They're gonna get you! They're gonna get you!\\\". Halloween, the ultimate horror film!   10/10\", \"Brutal, emotionless Michael Myers stabs his sister to death at age six on Halloween night in 1963; on October 30, 1978, he escapes from a mental institution and institutes a new reign of terror in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. He is pursued the whole time by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence) who knows just how evil this young man is.  It opens with a bang, and sets up a genuinely suspenseful and atmospheric chiller that is actually superior to the many slasher pictures it helped to inspire. It's subtle compared to the nasty bloodbaths many of those subsequent movies were; subtle, and scary. It retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated viewings. How many movies are there, really, that can continue to be frightening even after one has seen them before? Not very many.  Pleasence is great in what was probably the definitive role of his career; Jamie Lee Curtis, in her motion picture debut, became a bona fide scream queen after acting in \\\"Halloween\\\" as well as a few subsequent slasher pictures, and she is an intended victim worth rooting for.  Co-writer / director John Carpenter knows what works in this movie, making excellent use of shadows and dark skies; notice how most of the movie is set after nightfall. With this picture, he and his former collaborator Debra Hill created a franchise that has spawned seven sequels, many imitators, and an upcoming \\\"re-imagining\\\".  It's very quotable - who could ever forget Dr. Loomis' (Pleasence) speech in which he describes Michael Myers to the sheriff (Charles Cyphers, a reliable repertory player in several of Carpenter's earlier works)?  It's fantastic, and worth seeking out. This is my favorite John Carpenter movie of all time.  It's not totally infallible - there are script holes, after all - but overall it makes a solid impact.  9/10\", \"My personal favorite horror film. From the lengthy first tracking shot to the final story twist, this is Carpenter's masterpiece.  Halloween night 1963, little Michael Meyers murders his older sister. All-hallows-eve 1978, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove sanitarium. Halloween night, Michael has come home to murder again.  The story is perfectly simple, Michael stalks and kills babysitters. No bells or whistles, just the basics. It's Carpenter's almost over-powering atmosphere of dread that generates the tension. Like any great horror film, events are telegraphed long in advance, yet they still seem to occur at random, never allowing the audience to the chance to second guess the film.  The dark lighting, the long steady-cam shots, and (most importantly) that damn eerie music create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I have yet to see in film. There is a body count, but compared to the slew of slashers after this it's fairly small. That and most of the murders are nearly bloodless. The fear is not in death, but in not knowing.  The acting is roundelay good. PJ Soles provides much of the films limited humor (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis turns in a decent performance and then there is the young (at the time) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. Her performance at first seems shy and un-assured, yet you quickly realize that it is perfect for the character, who is herself shy and un-assured and not at all prepared for what she is to face. And of course there is the perfectly cast Donald Pleasence as the determined (perhaps a little unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace Mr. Pleasence.  If the film has a detrimental flaw, it would be the passage of time. Since the release of this film so many years ago nearly countless clones, copies, rip-offs, and imitators have come along and stolen (usually badly) the films best bits until nearly everything about it has become familiar. Combined with the changes for audience expectations and appetites, one finds much of the films raw power diluted. To truly appreciate it in this day and age, it must be viewed as it once was, as something unique.  Never the less, I have no reservation with highly recommending this film to anyone looking for a good, scary time. Highest Reguards.  10/10\", \"John Carpenter's Halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece. It tells the immortal story of escaped mental patient Michael Myers, who returns to his hometown on Halloween night to stalk and kill a group of babysitters.  This was the first and without doubt the best in the Halloween franchise. Carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters; unusual for a horror picture.  Even more unusual is the non-existence of blood and gore, and yet it remains the scariest Halloween to date. Get that!   Halloween marked the film debut of Jamie Lee Curtis and a defining point in the late great Donald Pleasance's career. A true classic.\", \"Halloween is not only the godfather of all slasher movies but the greatest horror movie ever! John Carpenter and Debra Hill created the most suspenseful, creepy, and terrifying movie of all time with this classic chiller. Michael Myers is such a phenomenal monster in this movie that he inspired scores of imitators, such as Jason Vorhees (Friday the 13th), The Miner (My Bloody Valentine), and Charlie Puckett (The Night Brings Charlie). Okay, so I got a little obscure there, but it just goes to show you the impact that this movie had on the entire horror genre. No longer did a monster have to come from King Tut's tomb or from Dr. Frankenstein's lab. He could be created in the cozy little neighborhoods of suburbia. And on The Night He Came Home...Haddonfield, Illinois and the viewers would never be the same. There are many aspects of this movie that make it the crowning jewel of horror movies. First is the setting...it takes place in what appears to be a normal suburban neighborhood. Many of us who grew up in an area such as this can easily identify with the characters. This is the type of neighborhood where you feel safe, but if trouble starts to brew, nobody wants to lift a finger to get involved (especially when a heavy-breathing madman is trying to skewer our young heroine.) Along with the setting, the movie takes place on Halloween!! The scariest night of the year! While most people are carving jack-o-lanterns, Michael Myers is looking to carve up some teenie-boppers. Besides the setting, there is some great acting. Jamie Lee Curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine, Laurie Strode, a goody-two-shoes high-schooler who can never seem to find a date. However, it is Donald Pleasance, as Dr. Sam Loomis, who really steals the show. His portrayal of the good doctor, who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of Michael Myers and feels compelled to send him to Hell once and for all, is the stuff of horror legend. However, it is the synthesizer score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film. Once you hear it, you will never forget it. I also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture. Nowadays, they seem to sharpen up the image of every movie, giving us every possible detail of the monster we are supposed to be afraid of. In Halloween, John Carpenter never really lets us get a complete look at Michael Myers. He always seems like he is a part of the shadows, and, I think that is what makes him so terrifying. There are many scenes where Michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens (unbeknownst to them), which adds to his creepiness. If you think about, some wacko could be watching you right now and you wouldn't even know it. Unfortunately for our teenagers (and fortunately for us horror fans), when they find Michael, he's not looking for candy on this Halloween night..he's looking for blood. Finally, Michael Myers, himself, is a key element to this movie's effectiveness. His relentless pursuit of Laurie Strode makes him seem like the killer who will never stop. He is the bogeyman that will haunt you for the rest of your life. So,if you have not seen this movie (if there are still some of you out there who haven't, or even if you have), grab some popcorn, turn off every light, pop this into the old DVD and watch in fright. Trick or Treat!\", \"I have just recently been through a stage where I wanted to see why it is that horror films of the 90's can't hold a candle to 70's and 80's horror films. I have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like The Haunting and Urban Legend and such. I feel that they (and others like them) don't know what true horror is. And it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films. I already own all the Friday's so I rented The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the original Nightmare On Elm Street, Jaws, The Exorcist, Angel Heart, The Exorcist and Halloween. Now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that I want to tell you about Halloween. Because what Halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do, and that is it uses subtle techniques, techniques that don't rely on blood and gore, and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you. I was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as I knew it was, I wanted to look behind me to see if Michael Myers was there. No movie that I have seen in the last ten years has done that to me. No movie.  John Carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers. He showed that you don't need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience. Because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens, but what is about to happen. What was that shadow? What was that noise upstairs? He knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that I think you can use. I even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today. But they don't. No one uses lighting and detail to provoke scares, they use special effects and rivers of blood. And it is just not the same. You can't be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall. It's the moments when the killer is lurking, somewhere, you just don't know where, that scare you. And Halloween succeeds like no other film in this endeavor.  In 1963 a young Micael Myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life, silently locked up in an institute. As Loomis ( his doctor) says to Sheriff Brackett, \\\" I spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out, because what I saw behind those eyes was pure e-vil. \\\" That sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants. And all he wants here is to kill Laurie. No one know why he wants to kill her, but he does.( Halloween II continues the story quite well )  What Carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score, mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror. There is one scene that has to be described. And that is the scene where Annie is on her way to pick up Paul. She goes to the car and tries to open it. Only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house. She gets them, comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys. The audience picks up on this but she doesn't. She is too busy thinking about Paul. When she sits down, she notices that the windows are fogged up. She is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist, and then Myers strikes, from the back seat. This is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail. We know what is happening and Annie doesn't. But it's astute observations that Carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond.   Halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background, it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall, dark rooms, creepy and haunting music, a sinister story told hauntingly by Donald Pleasance and a menacing, relentless killer. My advice to film makers in our day and age is to study Halloween. It should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about. After all, Carpenter followed in Hitchcock's steps, maybe director's should follow in his.  Halloween personifies everything that scares us. If you are tired of all the mindless horror films that don't know the difference between evil and cuteness, then Halloween is a film that should be seen. It won't let you down. I enjoy being scared, I don't know why, but I do. But nothing has scared me in the 90's, except maybe one film ( Wes Craven's final Nightmare ). If you enjoy beings scared, then Halloween is one that you should see. And if you have already seen it a hundred times, go and watch it again, back to back with a film like Urban Legend. Urban Legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie. Halloween will have you frozen with fear, stuck in your seat, not wanting to move. Now tell me, what horror film would you rather watch?  And just to follow up after seeing Zombie's version, it makes you appreciate this that much more. This is a classic by definition. Zombie bastardized his version, but it doesn't take away from the brilliance of this one.\", \"I do admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view, nearly 30 years after the making of this movie and at the time of its conception, it may have been a brilliant horror/thriller movie.  Beginning on Halloween night 1968, 6 year old Michael commits the brutal murder of his 18 year old sister. Michael is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later escapes and returns to his home town to murder again.  From this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable. The beginning of every scene is easily predictable in the way it will end whilst the music for each scene containing Michael (the murderer) is exactly the same throughout the movie, thus alerting the viewer to the likely events to follow.  For the horror/thriller enthusiast, there is a severe lack of blood/gore compared to modern day films although I am not akin to the amount that is displayed in this day and age. A happier medium could have been found.  From a half hour into the movie, not one scene is unexpected. The acting for a horror/thriller film is fairly typical of the era and thus lacks any punch for the modern day enthusiast.  A positive for the film is its lingering camera shots and dark lighting which creates a frightening atmosphere. A second positive would be the character of Michael's doctor, who provides clues to the probability of where the story may lead.  However, it is clear that the star, in Jamie-Lee Curtis, is in the infancy stages of her acting career and thus fails to provide a truly frightened central victim.  It is hard for me to rate this film as it was in its day, but from other horror/thriller films of indeed the 80s and to a lesser extent, the 90s, it falls far short of a truly great horror/thriller film.  I suggest you move on and find a classic from the 80s. Cheers!\", \"Perhaps one of the most overrated so-called horror classics ever made, Halloween does feature the memorable Michael Myers and some great acting by Jamie Lee Curtis.  However, its rewatchability factor is very close to zero, as there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on dullness/culmination to the actual events.  This is the sort of movie you can walk away from to microwave popcorn and not miss anything at all.  How it spawned so many sequels, I will never comprehend.  Thank God Rob Zombie is remaking this. And generally, I hate remakes.  Surely he will more than compensate for all the random time-filling gaps with some quirky points of interest that the original severely lacks.  This is a movie we feel we have to like, much like the way we're taught that we SHOULD enjoy Dickens.  Don't assume this is a classic.\", \"What the hell is in your minds ? This film sucks ! Each minute I was getting more and more bored. I strove to watch the end because I hope something at least would at last happen ! But instead of that, I got amazed how dull the end was treated... What is this story about this bloody \\\"bogeyman\\\" ? How comes he doesn't die ? He is a bloody human being for God's sake ! A mere boy that killed his silly sister 15 years ago. Then what ? His stay on a psychiatric hospital made him immortal ? This film a fascinatingly stupid... It's a must of silliness. I'm gonna resell it right now to some silly guy who will understand this silly film.\", \"I'm sorry, but this may have been scary in 1978 when it came out, but in modern times it just doesn't hold up. The only interesting scene in the entire movie is the opening scene where Michael kills his sister, Judith, wearing his Halloween mask. The most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter. The film goes downhill from there and doesn't pick up until the last fifteen minutes, but by then it's too late, we the audience have lost all interest in the story. There is barely any character development, and people always rave about Laurie being such an exceptional heroine, when there really isn't much to her. I'm sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie, but if you want a great horror movie go watch The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. Those are the two best horror films ever made. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. I can't believe Roger Ebert gave it four stars, for there is no way this film could ever deserve such a high rating.\"], \"review_score\": [10, 10, 8, 10, 10, 10, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10, 9, 10, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1], \"review_category\": [\"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 8.5}, \"Hannah and Her Sisters\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0091167\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Hannibal\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0212985\", \"total_review_count\": 10, \"total_rating_count\": 10, \"review_content\": [\"The only reason I didn't fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not that comfortable. Hannibal is BORING>BORING> BORING and BORING!!! This film is just dreadful, not because of any violence or graphic mutilations. It's actually quite tame in that regard. The story moves at the speed of a lazy snail. I have the feeling that director Ridley Scott just phoned this one in. The actors are all fine they just needed some direction. The music score is also very annoying. It's especially noticeable since so little is going on in the film. It does look good but that's not enough reason to see it. By the way did I mention that it's BORING?  \", \"Well, 1st off I haven't seen \\\"Silence of the Lambs\\\" yet.... but, I think that I would have become sick if I would have seen it before this piece. Not from the gruesome violence but, from the lack of everything else. Anthony Hopkins was very good as Hannibal and I really believed that he was as psychotic as he played himself off to be but, from the reaction of the audience around me, the film was filled with cliches from \\\"Silence\\\" which left me lost at points where others were laughing at what was on the screen.  Now, I heard that the movie would be very gruesome and if the director wanted to gross folks out... he did it... but, only in 2 sequences? I mean, if you want it to be gruesome and I mean, so gruesome that you're going to play the film off of that... you need more than 2 sequences.. I always see it as a film has to either become that cinematic jewel which will ultimatley take you to another place and time or either go over the top (which most of the time is done in bad taste). But, this film left me sitting in my chair and falling asleep at times.   Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore are the stars of the movie, right? Well, with the exception of Hopkins, I didn't feel that way.. Who cared about the stupid Italian police officer? I definatley didn't. So, really the film is left with a big hole talking about a guy who dies anyway. I mean, come on.. who cares?  In a nutshell, the movie is good if you want to see Lector and Starling once again but, if you're going for a really good thriller... you'll jump once and be grossed out maybe twice. Depends on your level.  Thinking about how much money this movie will bring in... there will probably be another \\\"Hannibal\\\" made and this movie probably won't be on video until the fall. If you must see it.. wait and save the $3.50 - $4.00 and get it on video. Don't spend the big bucks on this film.\", \"I completely understand WHY this movie was made. Silence of the Lambs was an incredible film - a gruesome thriller with a superb story and high jump-factor....  What I don't understand is why THIS movie was made... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed to reprise his role as Hannibal the Cannibal in this terrible and dissatisfying film.  There's no possible way to spoil the movie any further than going to see it could, but for those of you who prefer to waste your money, DON't READ ON. The film is absolutely horrible. It's so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore becomes a non-issue.   The only way to truly enjoy the film is to set your watch and leave the theatre exactly two hours into the film, because up until that point, it's quite an interesting thriller. The reparte between Moore and Hopkins is comparable to Hopkins and Foster, and the performances by the other characters are pretty good. But literally at the two hour mark, the film degrades into nothing but a cheesy D-grade horror flick...it's sick, and it's stupid and almost like the crew ran out of filming time, and threw together an ending in one day of filming.  Initial buzz over the Thomas Harris' book's unsatisfying and bizarre ending led director Ridley Scott to order a re-write... and, honestly, having seen the film AND read the book's finale, I don't know which is worse.  Please - don't waste your money OR time on this film, unless you're prepared to leave EXACTLY at the two hour point, because that's the ONLY way you'll feel satisfied about the saga of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter... continuing the mystery that made the first film, and the wait for this one, so great.\", \"I'm a big fan of Thomas Harris,I read all his novels at least 5 times and Hannibal's the book I really love the most.Therefore the movie was my biggest disappointment and I really don't get it why some folks here give it a nine or even a ten.Either their demands are very low or they haven't read the book or both.Even if I hadn't read the book I'd still consider the movie as absolute average and I'd give it a five. The creepy,mysterious atmosphere from the novel doesn't appear one single time in the movie,when I saw it first in the cinema I even fell asleep.Why was Margot Verger, a very important character, totally omitted? Why was Barney shown as a dumb ignorant whose only ambition is to earn money? And most of all, why was the psychological process Starling went through in the end,caused by the drugs Lecter applied to her,descended? Not to speak about the fact that the ending was omitted,too,and totally changed? Well, the reasons why Jodie Foster refused to play Starling again are well known and I accepted it,although like surely many others I'm very disappointed 'cause I identified Starling with her.For stories like Red Dragon,The silence of the lambs or Hannibal that possess such psychological depth, it is very important to identify with a character when they're adapted for the screen,but as the Germans say, that's \\\"snow of yesterday\\\". Ridley Scott did some incredibly good movies but with this one he doesn't live up to his name. Jonathan Demme had exactly the right feeling for the plot, the characters and their relationships towards each other in The silence of the lambs, he should have done Hannibal,too.My only comfort is that I've seen the movie only two times,it's long ago and thank god for that reason I'm able not to see the scenes from the movie when I read the novel. I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.\", \"One of the worst theatrical movies of the year, if not all time. Anthony Hopkins belittles himself by even appearing in this joke. I can't believe David Mamet and Ridley Scott's name appear on this travesty. The best career move Jody Foster ever made was turning this one down. Julianne Moore was as emotionless throughout as a female Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was of course, his brilliant self. He is a crippled victim of Hannibal and the make-up is so good, I didn't know it was Gary until the final credits. but eaten by trained boars??? Give me a break! Rumor has it that he didn't want his name even mentioned in the credits. And frying and feeding his own brain to Ray Liotta...I was laughing at the absurdity, no make that stupidity of this flick at this point. I haven't seen so many people walk out of a movie since Who's That Girl.  Pay someone else to go for you if you must, but miss this one AT ALL COST!!!\", \"*Hannibal SPOILERS* Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is back... for a travesty of a movie! Now he's in Italy, appreciating our food (including people, such as Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini)), but comes back to the States for Clarice (Julianne Moore) and to even the score with a former victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman).  Let me tell you, this movie does not deserve to be spoken of along with Silence Of The Lambs and Manhunter, because it's truly, completely, absolutely, totally BAD.  I mean, the scene near the end with Ray Liotta's cranium being opened and him forced to eat part of his brain saut\\u00e9ed? WTF? Then, why the HELL was everybody so annoying (including Clarice)? And why did the story keep going nowhere? I suppose that this is the 'teen' chapter of the Hannibal series; terrible, stupid, gory for gore's sake and totally embarrassing.  Don't watch it, especially if you love any other of the Hannibal movies (SOTL, Manhunter, Red Dragon, Hannibal Rising).  Hannibal: 1/10.\", \"Hannibal must be the most God-awful movie I have seen in a long time. In fact, I want my money back. What a waste of time. No plot, minimal character development, questionable motives, poor dialogue, sub-standard acting. What else can I say? If you haven't seen it don't bother. I wouldn't even hire out the video and if you happen to come by it on TV... change the channel. The only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see whether the gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype (which quite frankly is why they added it). If you want to see some gug eating his own brain, then fast forward to that bit.  What was the purpose of this movie? Its like someone just asked 'I wonder what Hannibal is up to these days' and we just went along for the ride. He is free in the beginning and he's free at the end. In between is a lot of self-indulgence on the part of Anthony Hopkins and the film makers. Julianne Moore tries valiantly to inject some life into her Clarice, but they gave her a sub-standard script and as far as I'm concerned she was set up to fail.  In my opinion this is just a very very bad story in every sense of the word. The only reason it made so much money was because of the senseless violence they added, which at the end of the day leaves you more with a feeling of contempt than the horror you are supposed to feel.  I give it a big fat RASPBERRY!\", \"Synopsis: the sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal is a big budget production that totally fails to deliver; not only is it not as clever as its predecessor, it is not even a splatter or suspense or horror movie, just a totally boring time waster. Do not be fooled by the media hype, and particularly the stories about people throwing up in cinema and being mentally scarred for the rest of their lifes because of the brain - eating scene: in the movie it just comes across as laughably bad SFX. Why so many people in this forum are claiming that H is \\\"not all bad\\\" and \\\"worth watching on the big screen\\\", etc., is beyond me; and it is not \\\"so bad it's good\\\" either, it is just plain boring. I normally respect other people's opinion, but in this case I have to say that they clearly can not tell **** from Shine - Ola. Maybe they have fallen prey to the media hype, maybe they have never seen a Ridley Scott movie before and were impressed by his excessive use of back lighting, smoke and the ubiquitous AC fans. H is totally devoid of suspense; instead we get endless scenes of Lecter swanning through an English - speaking Firenze, a totally unconvincing and uninvolving plot with more holes than a fishing net (after seeing H, I actually lay awake half of the night trying to find all the holes in the plot, and when I wrote them down I quickly filled 6 pages in small type before forcing myself to stop). Rather than wasting your time and money on seeing it on the big screen, I would advise you to wait until it comes on TV in a couple of years; and then to go to bed early.  1 / 10.  Below are a couple of extra bones I have to pick with Hannibal:  - H _is_ the sequel to SOTL, despite what some people in this forum are claiming. And even though SOTL was a very tough act to follow, there are sequels which _are_ en par with their predecessors (SOTL itself was the sequel to Michael Mann's \\\"Manhunter\\\", based on Thomas Harris' \\\"Red Dragon\\\", and even though the first episode was a very enjoyable film, SOTL was even better; another example would be the Alien series initiated by H's director Ridley Scott -- so much for the theory of diminishing sequels). In any case, being a sequel is no excuse for a film being utter crap.  - This movie has a renowned director, it is based on a novel by the same author as SOTL, the cast is strictly A - list, great cinematography, big budget, first - rate script writers, yadda, yadda, yadda, and the end result is simply a fart in the church. So what went wrong? I think a lot of the blame has to go to the film's producer, Dino DeLaurentiis. Here is my interpretation: DDL produced \\\"Manhunter\\\", which, despite of all its qualities, was a commercial flop. Disappointed, he gave the rights for the Hannibal Lecter character to Orion -- for free, allowing Jonathan Demme to make SOTL, and the rest is cinema history. DDL then had to wait for ten more years (he is now 81) until Thomas Harris finally came up with the sequel novel. I think at this point DDL had lost all interest in making a good movie and was desperate to finally get his slice of the the cake before he pops his cork.  - Another aspect that I find thoroughly annoying about this flick is that it is being given so much undeserved hype in the media; I mean, it is boring, yet one of the highest - grossing productions ever, so there is no need to give it free publicity. And while most reviewers harp on about how Dantesque the scenes in Firenze are and why Jodie Foster did not participate, the simple fact that this movie is an utter, utter, UTTER flop goes unmentioned. But there is more: not only is Hannibal being hyped through the roof, it is also being used as a media agenda setter for a plethora of \\\"documentaries\\\" (usually the left - overs from similar productions in the wake of SOTL) about serial killers, cannibalism and profiling. However, not only does H not even pretend to be realistic; Lecter has also ceased to be a serial killer (he now only kills out of necessity, or to help Clarice Starling), profiling is not even mentioned (because we already know HL, so there is no need to create a profile) and there is also no cannibalism: Lecter feeds the drugged - up Paul Krendler his own brain, so that makes it (erm) unaware vivo - auto - cannibalism. Try making a documentary out of that.  - Much has been said about the acting: mainly whether Julianne Moore can replace Jodie Foster, and Anthony Hopkins (who plays the lead Hannibal Lecter) is usually given a lot of praise. I think all of these discussions are moot. There are several of my favourite actors in this movie (namely Liotta, Oldman and Moore) but the script simply does not give them anything to work with. Same for Hopkins: there is no development in his character, and he is not being challenged in any way. And by the way, he plays nearly identical characters in all of his movies, only that in H he has to do the odd bit of murder and is getting paid the tidy sum of $ 11 Million to do it.\", \"I have witnessed some atrocities of cinema. In the past couple of years, it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity. Hannibal was not an exception. I wasn't expecting much, when I went in to see the movie. The book was ridiculous, and the saying, \\\"The Book is always better than the movie\\\" did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash. But what I came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison.   Usually, when I see a terrible movie, I find myself more amused than anything else. Sadly though, I could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a film that Hannibal is. The movie was filmed with promise, I guess. It had Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, and Gary Oldman. And for directing, there was Ridley Scott. There have been movies with significantly less talent that have been tremendously better. There was so much I would have cut from this film that I doubt anything would have remained. It was pathetic. The storyline was so ludicrous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it. What's worse is that the book was even crazier, and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included, which is sad in the case of a movie where  ***SPOILER AHEAD***   Ray Liotta's brain was being cooked in pieces. That scene more than any other made me want to cry, because it tarnished its predecessor to such a monumental level. Silence of the Lambs was one of my favorite films of all time. But Hannibal was a two hour plus joke. This movie should only be watched, if people want to learn how not to write a good movie.\", \"Hollywood has churned out yet another garbage that's wildly overhyped and underwhelming on a first-time viewing basis. Hannibal is bad, terrible, inept, lame, droll, idiotic, contrived, laughable and utterly atrocious (no pun intended). Minor spoilers follow...  This movie has huge logic holes - more than any Bruckheimer/Bay movie - or for that matter - any movie that exemplify the indulgence of Hollywood exaggeration. It's a slick Hollywood production designed to cash in on Hannibal Lector mania, directed by \\\"so-somber-he-takes-this-way-too-seriously\\\" hack director Ridley Scott and produced by a hack Italian producer with an inflated ego whose credo is \\\"doesn't matter whether film is s**t, money is good\\\".  I can't get over the fact that acclaimed screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote this tripe adapted from a lame and pretentious book by a good-novelist-turned-hack-author Thomas Harris. David and Steven - well-known and immensely talented screenwriters - wasted their effort on a poor screenplay in exchange for fat paychecks. Another factor in the disappointment of this film.  There are too many ludicrous scenes to list that are laughable in clunky execution and poor logic e.g. Starling/Pazzi cell-phone in the midst of Lecter pursuit that turns up Inspector Pazzi as the victim. Not to mention laughably bad dialogues delivered by Tony Hopkins with a smirk and Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta and others who cannot act with the straight face. Hopkins gives the true meaning of \\\"scenery-chewing\\\" along with hammy acting by Gary Oldman as a deformed psychopath bent on exacting revenge against Lecter.  The gore effect is good, but only serves to repulse rather than provide suspense which is notably absent from Hannibal. The predecessor - Silence of the Lambs - is more believable with tension and suspense. Suspense is what made Silence of the Lamb work as a spectacular mix of psychological horror and thriller, not to mention superbly written and tensely directed. The \\\"brain dinner\\\" sequence is so laughably fake it borders on self-parody.  The ending is kinda blatant and idiotic - are we supposed to believe that Lecter is still a menace to society with the last shot establishing his glittering eye glaring at you?

All the spin offs of the new hellraisers are a big dissapointment. It's no longer fun to watch. I recommend seeing \\\"the devils backbone\\\" instead.\", \"The original two Hellraiser films are absolute classics, and while I quite liked the boisterous third part - I'd really rather they stopped making sequels after Hellbound. You really can't go into any post-Hellbound sequel expecting anything resembling a good film, and that is truer than ever when it comes to the ones directed by Rick Bota. The first film I saw from him was the eighth part, Hellworld, and I don't rate it too highly - however, it's certainly the best one he's done. Hellseeker sees the return of Ashley Laurence to the series in the role of Kirsty, and the good news is that she still has the charming good looks that made her role in the first two films so good. The good news stops there, however, as just like the rubbish seventh part; Hellseeker sees Rick Bota in dull mystery territory once again. The plot sees Laurence killed in the first few seconds, and we then follow her husband (played by someone called Dean Winters) as the world around him is turned on its head. He's surrounded by slutty women, and the cops think he killed his wife...maybe he's in hell...  What's really annoying about this film is that buried somewhere beneath the messy screenplay, is the grounds for a fairly good plot. When the film finally reveals itself in the final ten minutes, the short sequences that put everything together are miles better than the rest of the film, and it makes me wonder why the writers decided to make the film work from the standard hallucination filled plot when there's was a far darker, much more interesting and, most of all, far more relevant to the series, story waiting in the wings. It's obvious that whoever's in charge of these new Hellraiser films doesn't give a damn about the series and the fans...but what doesn't make sense is that, if a good one was made, word of mouth would get round and more profit would eventually be made. It's a massive shame really, as the original Hellraiser deserves better than crap like this. Anyway, the film is boring, features hardly any horror and even the best part of the film - namely the last ten minutes - is dogged by the fact that the film could have been a million times better. Overall, unless you're a real hardcore fan of the series\\u0085this really isn't worth ninety minutes of anyone's time.\", \"I had the opportunity to watch this movie as a screener and was not shocked by its disappointment. This movie reunites Kristy Cotton(Ashley Lawrence)and Pin Head (Doug Bradley) for the 4th time and hopefully the last. The plot revolves around Kristys husband Trevor and his abnormal life after a car accident. Flashes of the cenobytes and pinhead and the fact that he cant remember the previous month causes Trevor to go insane. No one has seen Kristy for since the accident and the cops are thinking that foul play was involved and Trevor is their main suspect. Later on you start to realize what pain and anguish you have to go through to get \\\"all problems solved\\\".  The problem with this film is that its lacking in what made the first 2 films popular. Pinhead and his cenobytes are rarely seen in this film and it lacks the hellish looks. The film starts to resort to nudity to help keep interest in the plot. The series would of been better if the creators would of stopped at bloodlines. It seems like the produces are milking this for all that its worth by coming up with plotlines that have almost nothing to do with the original film. There are no morals to the story and there is nothing you can gain by watching this film. One thing that this film can be praised on is the used of special effects and the sound track, which is a rarity in most direct to video releases. In conclusion I would say watch this film if your a huge fan of horrible rip offs of great 80's horror movies. If you liked this film I would suggest Texas Chainsaw Massacre 4 The Next Generation.\", \"Where to start? This is my first \\\"review\\\" here, so I apologize if I start to ramble. I saw that SOMEHOW this movie was receiving good review scores and had to come put a stop to it. All in the deed of saving your souls, of course.  First off, this movie is even worse than Inferno. For those of you who follow the series like I do, you'll understand just what this means. Yet again, the movie has nothing to do with hell, demons, pain, or psychology. Like Inferno, it again POORLY relies on some kind of \\\"inner mind struggle.\\\" Granted, this might be a cool concept but it is just done so wrong.  The movie is almost impossible to watch too (not just because it sucks). It's one of those ridiculously stupid \\\"flashback/dream sequence\\\" flicks. You know, where you're watching for 10 minutes, the character wakes up, takes a couple steps forward, then wakes up again 10 minutes earlier. It then tries to piece together the amensia of the main character through flashbacks, but these scenes never add up to any kind of plot/insight because yet again you don't know if the character is dreaming or if it really happened. The flashback never really progresses futher either. Let me just reiterate: I know that previous statement might sound like a good concept (and it could be) but it just was not put together well at all.  Gore? There really isn't any. You get a pretty cool lobotomy scene at the beginning, but that's about it. A couple more people die, but it's not violent, gory, or interesting. And yet again, since the character decides to keep dreaming the whole darn movie, the people that die are alive in the next scene.  Concerning Pinhead, I really have no idea why Douglas Bradley still does this crap. Like Inferno, he's reduced to nothing and has no thought provoking lines at all. What ever happened to his perfect speeches in Hell on Earth or the best scene in movie history: the mock crucifixtion? To be honest, I turned off the movie with 15 minutes left, so maybe he gets something out of his mouth at the end, but I really didn't see it happening.  Cenobites? Again, unless they come out in the last 15 minutes, you see one in a 5 second flash sequence and the other for about .2 seconds.  Well, I'm probably running out of space, so I'll sum it up. This movie sucks. It is a blasphemy to anything the Hellraiser series was. The Lament Configuration opens hell and you die, not you open the box then have a headache for an hour and half. It is OBVIOUS that the writer and director of this movie had only seen Inferno when they made this garbage. The only two lines that hearken back to previous flicks I'm sure was just told to them by Ashley Laurence. I mean, there's even little things like Pinhead pulling out one of his nails and there's no maggot at the end (sorry to keep referring to 3, I love the series up to 4). Pinhead has no decent dialogue and the Cenobites are inexistant. The story is stupid, utterly confusing and being smart does not help piece it together any better. Ashley has the leading name in the title credits and is in the movie for about 5 combined minutes. Getting her back really could have made a great movie, but they completely wasted her (she's only in those damn flashbacks which are pretty much the same scene over and over). Shame on all the people that made this movie and I plead all of them to have nothing to do with the next 2 that have been greenlighted. If you possess any intellect at all, do not even rent this movie. If you're one of those people that would give nonsense like this a 10/10, then I just feel sorry for you.\", \"Atrocity is the one word definition for this film. I dare say even Hellraiser: Bloodline and Hellraiser: Inferno are better than this film. While Pinhead's greater presence in this one than in the last is a welcome change, the Hellraiser movies were never originally about him or the Cenobites, even though they seemed to have evolved in that direction, which, with proper directing and writing, could have been a good thing.  Where to start? The acting is subpar at best, even compared to B-movies, even Ashley Lawrence, who did an excellent job in the first two films, delivers an underwhelming performance, let alone the job done by the protaganist Trevor. (I'm sorry I've made no reservations to learn any of the names from this film.)It's not to be blamed all on the actors, though. Sometimes a great actor or actress is hindered by the writing (i.e. Natalie Portman by George Lucas' dialogues, see her in The Professional or something else). And a warning, the writing is indecent, jerky and unnatural. The movie also doesn't feel quite at home carrying the Hellraiser title, aside from Pinhead and the Cenobites' presences and the occassional flash of the Lament Configuration. It doesn't possess the masterful storytelling of Clive Barker's imagination. Warning to the die-hard fan, your nit-picking will be far worse than this general, though wordy, comment (such as Pinhead's costume, if you're very observant, you'll know what I'm talking about). If you're hoping for a return to the roots, prepare for disillusion. I've loved all the Hellraiser movies, thus far, except III, which I've yet to see, but even this one wrenches my gut. Save your money and your time, go to the movies and put down the eight bucks for \\\"Red Dragon\\\" or whatever else floats your boat.\", \"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Oh boy. Okay. Where do I begin? Oh, yeah. It sucked. It was awful, horrible, etc. Especially for me, being that I've been looking forward to this movie since they began talking about it. I am a huge Hellraiser fan, I own the first 5 on DVD, but I somehow doubt that I'll be purchasing this one, maybe ask for it as a gift (but only to complete my collection.) So what else can I say about this movie? Well, I have to tell you, just seeing Ashley Laurence as Kirsty helped me get through the film. I always thought she was a talented and attractive actress, and I can see even 15 years later, she is still talented and beautiful. For the VERY limited screen time she has, she made me smile. Especially the sceenes in which she holds the puzzle box and talks to Pinhead...almost made me forget how much the rest of the movie blew. Almost. Let's see:the guy who played Trevor, Dean Winters, can not hold a movie by himself. He's not a terrible actor, but come on, he has no emotion. At all. But he was not the thing that pissed me off the most. What did that was the plot. This is NOT a Hellraiser movie. This is Dimension's way of trying to make some quick cash off of a once noble series. Come on, 1 and 2 are classics, 3 was average, 4 (though it got terrible reviews) was kinda fun, 5 was depressing but smart, but this: I can hardly describe this mess. Cenobites randomnly show up and disappear, Pinhead talks from in a puddle (?) and Kirsty is second billed in the credits, is in two scenes and about seven flashbacks. Amounting to about 10-12 minutes of screen time. (Also, the back of the box says she is trying to stop Pinhead, when she actually is very civil with him, in one whopping flashback.)*Spoilers Ahead* I have to admit, one of the reasons I kept watching this was to find out if Kirsty was really dead. I kept doubting it, and I guessed the ending (mainly because a flashback in the first 20 minutes showed it)and was happy she lived. But am I really supposed to expect that she killed those people? Is that even what did happen? It was all very confusing. *End of Spoilers* In conclusion, this is a movie you might (but probably won't) enjoy if you are not a fan of the early Hellraisers. I give this 2/10, just for the smile that Ashley Laurence brought to my face.\", \"Why does it seem like the Hellraiser films are slowly becoming morality tales? I am starting to think that. Inferno was mostly morality and i could deal with it because it was something different but in hellseeker, we have \\\"Lets make a deal\\\" Kirsty and a cheating spouse and also a tale of greed. Cmon now. This movie basically said in only a few words, if you cheat or your greedy you will go to hell. To top it off, not enough of Pinhead. Ugh. Definitley wouldn't suggest this.\", \"I'm a GIANT fan of the original story by Clive Barker and I think the first two Hellraisers were the greatest horror films ever to be produced. But, ever since Hellraiser 3, untalented directors wear out the name and use the villain-icon Pinhead as a marketing instrument to tell lame and inferior horror stories. Hellseeker ranks as the sixth episode in the series and it is - along with Inferno - the weakest effort so far. The original charm has faded away completely and the tone and atmosphere doesn't come near the morbid and raw originals. The story of Hellseeker has got nothing to do anymore with the original characters Clive Barker created and they might as well could have given this movie a completely new surrounding. Heroine Ashley Laurence is dragged into this film for no particular reason. She doesn't show any resemblance with her original character and even Pinhead himself has gone through a complete metamorphosis. He once was a true symbol of all that represents evil but, after 6 episodes, he merely looks like a lame philosopher who prefers to plea instead of to kill. Hellraiser:Hellseeker is an extremely boring experience with only a few remarkable scenes. And those particular scenes are in fact just a shadow of the ones in the original Hellraisers. It's nothing more than a mediocre attempt to build up a mystery tale. The first hour of this film is a series of hallucinations and illogical dream-sequences. Director Rick Bota constantly tries to fool the audience with plot-twists but, actually, the audience doesn't give a damn! The last 15 minutes of Hellseeker are the only ones worth seeing. Both Kirsty's and Pinhead's screen time are entirely in those minutes and it's the only time the script actually makes a bit sense. If you manage yourself to struggle through the first hour, you'll see a more or less satisfying ending. If the rumors are true, there will be two more sequels coming out in 2004 . Knowing myself a bit, I'll most likely see them...but my expectations have never before been so low!\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Hero\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0299977\", \"total_review_count\": 4, \"total_rating_count\": 4, \"review_content\": [\"It is impossible to avoid comparing Zhang Yimou's `Hero' to Ang Lee's `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.' They were both big-budget Chinese kung-fu films with breathtaking cinematography of Chinese landscape and a cast of super-stars. But aside from the obvious, there is in fact nothing else to compare. `Hero' fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters, proving that big-name stars, beautiful scenery, and action effects are no replacement for a director's artistry and vision.  All the marketing hype preceding the premier of `Hero' has done nothing more than make its failure a spectacular one. Much anticipated, `Hero' drew movie-goers in throngs when it first opened at theaters in mainland China and Hong Kong, making it an instant box-office success. However, though the script pleased government censors, Chinese audiences went to newfound heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their disdain. On-line critics, both professional and amateur, proclaimed the film `ideologically disturbing,' `from the viewpoint of deep servitude,' written `either by an amateur historian, or someone with ulterior motives.' One article was simply titled, `Hero, you make me sick!'  The deepest failing of the film is in its plot, which is not only morally reprehensible, and based on unforgivable historic fallacy but - worst of all for a film - is boring! All blockbuster epic films are known to take some liberties with the facts of history, but `Hero' goes beyond artistic license into unforgivable ignorance when it attempts to glorify an emperor that was as brutal as Stalin or Hitler. `Hero' does not make up for this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or fun. Instead, it is makes a woefully poor attempt at being `deep' and merely manages to be pretentious and preachy.  Though historians agree that the First Emperor of China was ruthlessly violent, Mao Zedong was known to have admired this ruler - no surprise, given Mao's own tyrannical rule. Likewise, the Communist government in Beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the First Emperor and its own iron-fist methods, so they were particularly pleased with this latest work by Zhang Yimou. Tony Leung, one of the stars of `Hero' remarked during an interview to promote the film that the Beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 by crushing the student demonstrations, because it was needed to maintain `stability' in China. For these remarks, Tony Leung received shocked criticisms in his home city of Hong Kong, but he merely stated out loud the underlying message of the movie.  Director Zhang Yimou has stated that his goal was to surpass the values of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung-fu novels and movies, to reveal a higher wisdom. Unfortunately, his version of `wisdom' turns out to be: THE OPPRESSOR IS RIGHT. In China, where thousands of years of historical reality have rammed this message through, art was the last sanctuary where the individual could actually find freedom from such tyranny. The great popularity of the kung-fu novel can be explained by its ability to provide an escape into an alternate world: one where kung-fu warriors roamed the country seeking adventure and fighting for justice, free from fear and winning against all odds with their super-human skills. Only in the novel did the individual ever win over institutionalized power in China, and only in the novel did the oppressed find their champions. Going against this tradition of the kung-fu hero, Zhang Yimou has not gone upwards towards a higher truth, as he had hoped, but downwards, to the level of government propaganda. It's no wonder the government was so pleased.  Some film lovers may secretly wonder, `All moralistic judgments aside, is it at least entertaining?' Fortunately, the answer is a resounding `No!' Because the same tale is told over and over with only slight variations, it becomes tedious to watch. Moreover, the three conflicting versions of the same story serves only to confuse the character development, since it leaves precious little time for the viewer to feel any sympathy for any of them once the `real' version emerges.  The film is not without its beautiful images. However, all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect to or enhance the storyline. The use of different colors to distinguish the separate versions of the tale comes across as simplistic and contrived, and the cinematography appears self-consciously rather than truly beautiful. Great for a trailer, but a disappointment once you are there to watch the entire film.  For those in China who showed disdain for `Crouching Tiger's' unrealistic kung-fu, much was expected from `Hero.' Jet Li, who plays the title role, is a real kung-fu artist who held national titles before beginning his career as an actor. His previous movies have revealed limited acting abilities, but many hoped that Zhang Yimou could use Li's lithe body movements to full effect while casting him properly in a role that would not task his acting abilities. But it was not to be. `Hero' attempts to go beyond the kung-fu genre, so there are not many fighting scenes, and Jet Li is expected to perform a difficult piece of acting: an inner transformation leading to profound wisdom and self-sacrifice. As the casting director ought to have expected, Li fails miserably. Meanwhile, the only fighting scene that reveals any true kung-fu skill is the first one of the film, between Li and and Donnie Yen. All the scenes that follow are a disappointment, so `Hero' fails to satisfy, even on that level.  Though most audiences outside China are unlikely to be aware of the historical mangling of the story of the cruel First Emperor, it seems even more unlikely that they would accept Zhang's version of `Chinese wisdom,' which is anything but. Perhaps the only time an audience coming out of a screening of `Hero' was seen smiling - instead of yawning or frowning - was at the special screening for Chinese government officials.  \", \"Impressive vision indeed, and some hot chicks with swords flying around, oh and those hypnotic Chinese violins too... Let me think, \\\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\\"?  I kinda liked CTHD, with its down-to-earth simplicity and well developed characters, that still left enough room for you to enjoy the vision without having to think about the DEEEPAA Meaning of it.  \\\"Hero\\\" on the other hand is painfully pretentious and demanding both visually and conceptually. The larger-than-life moral was horrible. I mean, sacrifice your life, sacrifice your beliefs, sacrifice your love so that your mighty nation can succeed???? WTF??  No, thanks.  But, hay, Mao and G.W.B. would be proud!  Viva\", \"The message of Hero is quite clear: the idea of Greater China is more important than the death and the suffering of millions. At a time when China is dangling its war toys over Taiwan, it is unacceptable for Western viewers to endorse this piece of over-produced, government-sponsored, dogmatic trash.  Particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media. Roger Ebert of Chicago Tribune, David Edelstein of Slate, Charles Taylor of Salon, and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed Hero. In so doing, they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message. The only critic (that I know of) who saw through the film's glossy facade was J. Hoberman of The Village Voice, who wrote of the film's \\\"sanctimonious traditionalism\\\" and its \\\"glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness.\\\" I, for one, sign my name under Hoberman's final pronouncement: Hero is nothing more than \\\"fascinating fascism.\\\"\", \"As a native Chinese, I can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a 'better world'. I said 'better world' because it is a lie that Chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousand years!   I guess most western audience may don't know Qin Shihuang(means the first emperor), the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient China. The Tianxia(Chinese word was spoken by the king, means 'the land and the people') spoken from his mouth is totally lie. From then on, one after another, all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they said.  Another fact is, Qin Shihuang's empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by people.  Well, I do like the beautiful scenes of this movie, but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant.\"], \"review_score\": [1, 1, 1, 1], \"review_category\": [\"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 1.0}, \"Hider in the House\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0097503\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Hostage\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0340163\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Hotel Rwanda\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0395169\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"House on Haunted Hill\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0185371\", \"total_review_count\": 14, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"But the ending? What the hell was that about? A load of swirly black shadows and faces never scared anyone, and doesn't explain anything either!  Although I did find it quite scary (I cope better with films like Saw than films involving ghosts/zombies/mutants/mental patients), it left me un-satisfied and a little ticked off that a film that started out quite well ended up so crappily.  As well as that, I watched the film knowing nothing about it. I thought it would be a proper haunted house (not a mental institution) so the fact that it was a scary place where the criminally insane had rebelled against their psychotic, mental patient butchering doctor was quite a nice surprise.  But apart from that, I didn't enjoy it much at all.\", \"By definition, I'd really refer to this as a shocker film rather than as a scary movie. This film prefers special effects and disturbing, bloody scenes to say suspense or good writing. The acting was sub-par at best, though I would say it may be Chris Kattan's best job yet. Average cut between shots has to be in the milli-seconds. The shot selection bounced so much I began having a headache. The only movie with more cuts was probably Domino. The ending was sub-par. The movie seemed to want to incorporate too many themes for one horror movie: killer husband/wife, haunted house, deranged surgeons, ancient evil, etc. The best part of the movie was that at very least they had the decency to set the tone early to let you know what was going to be coming at you. That being said, I did watch it all the way through, so it clearly wasn't as bad as it could have been.\", \"When I first saw this I wasn't much of a fan, and that wasn't due to comparing it to the original, as I hadn't seen Castle's 1958 version. Again while it isn't boring, due mainly to Geoffrey Rush's effectively diverting Vincent Price send up, and a saucy Famke Janssen. What we get is something of pretty sub-standard quality that heavily relies on glossy special effects, nasty blood spatter and contrived shocks of the tiresome kind. Dick Beebe's screenplay of Robb White's original story ups the twists, and unpleasant nature in a straight laced supernatural story. Even with its constant twists, it felt like they were there to cover how slight the premise was. The angle is more so serious and dark, though at times with a somewhat mock attitude compared with the plain outlandish, and overly campy style of the original. Which did make that one far more enjoyable, even with the usual haunted house devices. Here director William Malone goes about things in a conventionally slick, ultra-kinetic manner where it was just too streamlined (this being the art direction of the sombre looking house) and packed with many unconvincingly elaborated twists, and heavy handed jump scares that lacked any sort of unsettling punch. The basic \\\"let's go for something that sounds really scary\\\" music score, couldn't escape its generic notes of telegraphed predictability. At least the deaths are fairly twisted, and the morbid flair of Rush and Janssen's interplay is an unpredictable delight. The special effects weren't terrible and there a few well pulled off moments (like the jittery ghost doctors), but overall it didn't enhance or cook up much of a lasting atmosphere when they finally pile it on far too much. The final 15 minutes is a fine example. Ali Carter aggregately fluffs around, and Taye Riggs pretty much has that concerned face throughout. Peter Gallagher, Bridgette Wilson and Max Perlich make up the numbers. Jeffery Combs also appears in a spooky cameo part, that called out for more screen time.\", \"To be quite frank with you, I'm not really into horror movies at all. Though I wasn't held at gunpoint to see this movie, but I was persuaded by my friends instead. Let's get straight to the point by saying, that \\\"The House on Haunted Hill\\\" isn't remotely scary at all. In fact it is less scary than entering a haunted mansion at an amusement park. In fact if anyone wishes for me to see this movie again, you better pay me $1 million, because I just won't do it.  Now that I got that out of the way, let me break it down by examining the plot. Five guests have to spend one night in a burned down, condemned mental hospital in order to earn a quick million. If anything should happen to the guests, the money would be split among the survivors. The sole aspect that freaked me out was that it was set in a condemned sanitarium.And even that was not entirely convincing. I wasn't expecting Oscar-winning performances here, but the acting was purely banal, with the exception of Geoffrey Rush, who always cashes in terrific performances. Even though Chris Kattan was right up there with the other moving mannequins, he at least had some humorous lines. Scary doesn't describe my feelings about the movie, uncomfortable is the right word.   Many elements of the movie that I found distracting is that since the house brings all the mental patients together under one leader, why are they not inflicting pain on each other as well? Also why does the ghostly monster has to break down doors and floors in order to get to the heroes and yet the mortals get thrown through walls. It also bugs me that they must walk into a person's office when they're lost, especially since they know where it is and in spite of a few of them being killed along the way. And finally, with only a little time left to collect their cash winning prizes, the guests decide to make up their own quest by attempting to escape the house instead.   With these nuances I am convinced that those who have not seen it, are actually doing themselves a favor. I wanted at least the phantom-like monster to be scary as well, but that didn't happen either. In the end I was utterly exhausted and very frustrated by the whole, movie. Those who've seen it, tell those who never saw \\\"House on Haunted Hill\\\" to avoid it all costs. It wasn't scary or satisfying.\", \"What is this, after all? A remake in color of a schlock 45-year-old Vincent Price horror movie (not very good to begin with) featuring a cavalcade of special effects.  A rich amusement park owner (Geoffrey Rush) and his cynical -- and very tall -- wife (Famke Jannsen) invite half a dozen friends to spend the night in a deserted mansion. The survivors will get a millions bucks apiece. It's particularly spooky because the building is an ex psychiatric hospital in which the owner years ago went mad and slaughtered staff and patients alike. \\\"He out-Mansoned Manson,\\\" Peter Graves gravely intones on television.  At first it all seems like a kind of practical joke perpetrated by Rush, who is given to scary stunts. But then the house evidently locks itself up and nobody can get out or communicate with the outside, not even Rush. Most of the lights go out and the guests are stuck with the task of poking around with flashlights in the crumbling rooms filled with electronic torture devices.  It all gets pretty routine. One of the guests is a black guy and I figured him for an early victim. It's that kind of movie. There is a vat of what looks like boiling blood and someone gets pulled into it. There is a fake death. Falling skylights. Two pistols are produced, one supposedly loaded with blanks. And all kinds of mysterious goings on, go on. And -- and -- zzzzzzz.  I can see where someone might enjoy this. It's all formulaic, and it's a remake to begin with. But it's creepy, scary, and bloody enough to satisfy the kinds of desires generated in a mind whose cinematic faculty is as empty as a ping pong ball.  Want some spooky movies that embody some originality? If you haven't seen any of Val Lewton's tiny masterpieces -- \\\"The Cat People\\\" or \\\"I Walked With a Zombie\\\" -- or, say, \\\"The Haunting\\\" or \\\"Carnival of Souls,\\\" try them instead.\", \"From the beginning, you think that maybe this movie will develop into something really scary and frightening, hopefully breaking free of the rash of boring horror movies released over the last few months. Nope. It's got alot of goth-horror goriness for shock value, but it pretty much falls flat on its face two thirds of the way through.  The plot isn't too bad to begin with, but then it is neither explained nor developed... In general, the movie was lame, stupid, dumb, idiotic, ridiculous, pointless... what else can I say? I don't even want to type anymore because it isn't worth my time. I want a refund.\", \"This is one of the worst films of the year. There is no screenplay to speak of. There was not enough scares. They didn't need all the gore that they put in this film. The characters are so paper thin that they could float away. G. Rush overacts big time in this film. This was a complete waste of my time. Even the \\\"surprises\\\" in the film aren't clever or they are completely wasted in the next scene. This was a poorly done film with scenes just thrown together to make a movie. AVOID THIS!!!!!!!!!!\", \"I wanted to give this movie a 2 out of 10 rating for some interesting special effects, but I just can't. The fact that it was even made while other scripts (any other scripts) were passed over is a crime. None of the characters interested me, the story was boring, and the movie seemed to end abruptly. It started out bad and went downhill from there!\", \"This film had very little to offer anyone that appreciates good movies. It might seem silly to say, this being a remake of a haunted house movie, but there was no plot to be found, nor were there any worthy likable characters. It is just another bad remake. Hopefully producers will start actually trying to find new scripts to shoot.\", \"There are no real thrills in this movie and the missing storyline leaves you kind of empty and disappointed at the end of the movie. The plot is so weak, that it is not worth calling a horrormovie and the fact there are no boundaries makes it even more lousy. There where so many unexplained things happening (e.g. why is all the \\\"souls\\\" locked in one room?). It seemed like an okay movie at first, when they showed the black/white clips, but after that it went downhill and hit the bottom hard. My overall rating of this movie is lower than \\\"Scream 1+2\\\" and \\\"I know what you did last summer\\\" (and believe me, they rated really low!).\", \"Before I can begin to review the \\\"remake\\\" of House on Haunted Hill, we must first throw the plot, effects, and script out the window, because the movie does a pretty good job of that by itself. The only reason (and there really isn't ANY) that you should see this film is for the performances by three lovely and talented actresses: Ali Larter, Famke Janssen, and especially Bridgette Wilson. They make the film worthwhile, or at least the scenes that they're in. [SPOILER ALERT!!] The main reason I wanted to see this movie was because one of my favorite actresses, Bridgette Wilson, was in it and I was excited about seeing her camping it up in a horror movie like she did a few years ago in I Know What You Did Last Summer. And sure enough, there she is, with video camera in hand as pseudo-celebrity Melissa Margaret Marr, the best dressed and biggest ego of the group. Just when I think the movie might not be so bad with her in it, what happens? She dies! That's right. Within the first forty-five minutes, Bridgette Wilson is already gone and there's nothing left but Famke Janssen, who does all she can as Geoffrey Rush's psychotic wife before she herself too, dies, and Ali Larter, who deserves so much better than this movie and can be seen in a much better movie right now, Final Destination. As for the scares, puh-leese. The only frightening thing is that people still pay to see movies like this. The cheesy original was scarier, anyway, and had more fun with its cast. Nothing is truly scary at all, although it is a little gruesome at times. So while I wait for Bridgette Wilson to do another horror film, I'll have to say that HOHH is one of the worst movies I have EVER seen.\", \"PWT! Poor White Trash! the must ridiculous movie i have ever watched. It was so unbelievably pathetic, inadequate, and so lame! the story line was stupid, the characters were DUFF! Geoffrey Rush did not to well. The ONLY thing i liked in this movie was his quote: \\\"So much for a Ph.D in engineering!\\\" but that could not save such horribly boring ridiculous stupid lame material. And how did the patients come out of their \\\"cells\\\" to attack Vaancut or whatever his name is. And how did they manage to stab 3 (three) 18.9 mm long pencils THROUGH his neck in ONE drive? And then again, the pencils aren't long enough to get all the way through still being able to have a grip on it! By the way, how come there were tv monitors everywehere? Nothing had been changed in it! Why didn't they use the guns? Why didn't they stick together? Don't watch! Bad stuff for kids! (I'm one..) 13 years old. I love Kubrick and Spielberg!\", \"I saw the trailer for this film at the cinema and was impressed by the special effects. When i actually watched the film on DVD this week i soon realised that the decent special effects featured on the trailer were in fact the only special effects in the film. Though i quite like the original, i absolutely hated this movie, and if it is true that Dark Castle productions are indeed planning to remake a whole host of William Castle movies then i hope they do a better job! The script was perhaps the worst i have witnessed in a long time, the characters were all so instantly annoying that i found my self wishing them dead with in the first fifteen minutes. It actually took me two sittings to watch the movie, it was either that or i would have found myself fast forwarding through it. The plot, what there is of it, doesn't make much sense and the film doesn't explain why certain things are happening, Price's wifes relationship with one of the guests for example. This movie was so bad i ended up feeling frustrated and cheated, it actually made me so angry. Avoid this like the plague.\", \"When five strangers are mysteriously invited to a party held at a haunted asylum, strange things start to unravel.... and everyone in the audience starts to fall asleep.  This movie is everything a movie should not be. It is a horror with no real scary parts in it. It has plenty of gore, and some good special effects, but aside from that, this movie has nothing in its favor. Maybe that's all you need to scare eight year olds and idiots, but for the average viewer, that just isn't going to cut it.  The characters are completely one-dimensional and have no motivation for anything they do. They are so undeveloped and stupid, you actually find yourself happy when they are killed. The plot, too, is undeveloped. What could be a great psychological horror falls short when the writer decided to tell nothing about what is happening and why. Why are the patients revolting? Why is the doctor commiting these horrible crimes?  Chris Kattan from Saturday Night Live makes an appearance, and this brought my hopes up thinking he would provide some sound comic relief, but instead he spends the whole movie ranting about how \\\"the house is alive,\\\" something we have known since the first five minutes.  Avoid this movie at all costs, it has enough holes in it to drive a Mack truck through.

SENTENCE FOR HOUSE OF THE DAMNED:BAD\", \"\\\"House of the Damned\\\" (also known as \\\"Spectre\\\") is one of your low budget haunted house horror flicks, filled with mediocre performances and cheap effects. It is about a family that inherits an old Irish mansion, and after moving in begin to experience strange phenomenon and ghostly apparitions, including the ghost of a young girl who was murdered and buried within a wall in the mansion's basement. The couple's young daughter is then whisked away into some other dimension and they seek help from a group of paranormal investigators for help.  The ideas this film borrowed from the 1982 haunted house film \\\"Poltergeist\\\" are obvious. I will say that this movie does have some slightly creepy sequences, but it is sometimes very, very boring. The acting here is nothing special, the mood is alright, the score (which was mostly this dramatic Irish opera music) was somewhat annoying, and the CGI special effects are really horrible. I mean, it was 1996, you would think they could have done a little better than they did. The ending where the house was on fire was the poorest special effect I've seen, very very cheap. But hey, this was a cheap movie.  Also, the translucent monster wolf thing that their daughter sees looks horribly fake. And what was it's significance in the film anyway? What the heck does a wolf-monster have to do with a haunted house? The special effects in here are what really ruined this movie. The acting was pretty bad too. I usually enjoy many low budget horror films, but not this one. \\\"House of the Damned\\\" is nothing special at all, only consider watching it if you have nothing better to do. But you'll probably want to pass on it. 4/10.\", \"Strange things happen to Americans Will (Greg Evigan), Maura (Alexandra Paul) and their young daughter Aubrey (Briana Evigan, Greg's real life daughter) when they move into a large, newly inherited house in Ireland. Crusty corpses are found in the cellar, a turkey squirts blood, furniture moves and the ghosts of a dead child and a cackling old lady show up to scare the little girl. Paranormal investigators are eventually called in to banish the evil spirits, but Maura becomes possessed anyway and chases everyone around with a meat cleaver.  This film is full of cliches, but there's a standout performance from Alexandra Paul... too bad it doesn't belong in this movie (nor any other I can think of off hand)! She can barely keep a straight face and her over-emoting and hysterical screaming tantrums are a joy to behold. In any case, she's a lot more interesting to watch than anything else in this movie.  Score: 3 out of 10\", \"New Year's Day. The day after consuming a few too many vodka martinis and Cosmopolitans mixed with a bunch of bubbly at midnight, my wife and I discovered the local cable company is offering up the digital specialty channels for free for the month of January. We had a choice - do we make use of the freebie channels or do we start watching the eight seasons of X-Files on DVD that we received from our daughter for Christmas?  We elected for the digital freebie since the DVDs are going nowhere and we need something like ten twelve-hour days to watch all the X-Files beginning to end. The Drive-In channel was offering a horror classic three movie marathon: Asylum (1972), House of the Damned (1996) and The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). Asylum is well-reviewed here and the Pit and the Pendulum was on too late for us to watch which meant we could really only be properly critical for House of the Damned.  To be honest, we tried to be serious about the movie since its stars have reasonably good acting credentials - Greg Evigan (William Shatner's over-written Tekwars) and Alexandra Paul (the only Baywatch babe who could act although she has the body of a ten-year-old boy). Unfortunately, we soon dissolved to giggles, under the influence of a little hair-of-the-dog, as we each shouted out the names of movies from which this dog borrowed its scenes: Poltergeist, The Shining, Hell House, House On Haunted Hill, Ghost Busters!  The acting, especially by Evigan's real-life daughter, wasn't too bad considering the silly script they had to work with. The CGI, for 1996, was hilarious - at its worst point in the final scene when it should have been the most horrific it was so bad my wife and I dissolved in laughter.  Overall: Acting 4/5, Script 2/5, SFX 0/5\", \"This movie is a clumsy mishmash of various ghost-story and suspense-thriller conventions, none of them fully realized and all of them rather irritating. The script was perfunctory. The acting, ditto. The scary FX were mostly laughable except for one exquisite seat-jumper moment that scared me even though I saw it coming a mile off. Now, explain to me someone why you would need ghosts, AND black magic, AND arcane ritual objects, AND Count Crapula CG boogeymen, AND psychic investigators, AND family curses, AND Irish superstitions, AND bowls of milk left out for the supernatural beings, AND possessed dollies, all in the same movie? With all that you would expect more than one good moment of horror, but this movie is lame, lame, lame.\", \"This was a letdown in many ways. The location filming in Ireland, though quite beautiful at times, cannot save this uninspired flick. Greg Evigan and Alexandra Paul, as the married couple trying to get their marriage back on track and who inherit a haunted mansion, just aren't interesting characters. Paul, towards the end of the film, becomes incredibly annoying and one wishes she would just close her mouth and shut up, as it seems she is screaming as if it has just become an Olympic event! Other problems with this film are odd segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film, such as the opening sequence with two cleaning women and the woman in a bed with a severed hand climbing over her writhing, naked body. Although the woman is quite adequate doing this it does nothing storywise. One is left thinking the production team needed to pad out a short running time and just tossed in some padding and a bit of T and A. The CGI effects are cartoonish as well and the fiery finale rivals co-executive producer Roger Corman's much earlier and far superior film The Fall Of The House Of Usher in all its ineffective cheapness. Any attempt at true tension and suspense, and as a result chills, are thrown out the window in this low budget bust. If you like images of Ireland you might find something here but you would do better renting or buying a travelogue. Skip this unless you are undiscriminating and think plot is secondary. Rent another low budget ghost story(if you can find it) titled The Woman In Black and see how good and scary a movie can be. This was a wasted opportunity.\", \"Given that Roger Corman attached his name to this production, I had high hopes for this film. Corman directed many memorable low budget horror flicks in the 1960's. I particularly enjoyed his adaptations of Poe's stories such as `The House Of Usher,' and `The Pit And Pendulum' and `The Raven' which starred the late great Vincent Price. These films had solid acting, atmosphere, suspense, strong characterization, intriguing plot development and delivered some chilling moments. Sadly, `House Of The Damned,' for the most part, sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects, gratuitous nudity and mindless gore topped with cliche fast edits and camera angles.  `House Of The Damned' starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in Ireland, but it's straight downhill from here. Unfortunately, instead of spending some time building atmosphere, creating characters we might care about, or building suspense - the director opts to begin running up the body count. After a brief introduction to the lead characters, a young couple and their daughter, the audience spends the balance of the film being bounced from one `spooky' event to another which, in this film, substitutes for coherent plot development. The lead characters are so ill conceived and are so badly acted - the audience doesn't care what happens to them. To make matters worse, the `spooky' events are either utterly clich\\u00e9 or unconvincing due to low tech - low budget special effects. The soundtrack has been lifted from `The Omen.' The plot, what little there is, borrows heavily from `Poltergeist' and `The Legend Of Hell House,' but lacks any of the qualities which made these films convincing.  If you interested in seeing well done haunted house flicks, I recommend you check out classics like `The Haunting (1963),' `The Innocents (1961) or look into Corman's early American International films and pass on `House Of The Damned' unless you're masochistic or mindless.  3 \\u00bd out of 10.

This is in-the-face parody at it's worst, everything is overdone from acting to scenery to story. I absolutely despise movies with Jim Carrey but compared to this movie, they are actually quite passable. You know which movie came to mind watching this? > The original Charly and the Chocolat factory. Mind you, that is a children's movie.  Who in their right minds can endure movies like this? No character is likable for it is not a character but a cartoon-figure, every turn in this so called story can be seen coming miles away and slapstick really had its highpoint way before even my former life started.

The movie itself is a farce. It borders on utterly ridiculous at times even by the standard of farces. There are enjoyable story arcs and a bit of workable humor, but the few redeeming elements (namely the love arc) of the movie are completely crushed by a rushed and largely unresolved ending. It's the most unsatisfying satisfying ending to a movie I'll ever seen.  I won't pretend that there's no entertainment value to the movie, but it can't be taken seriously on any level and it ultimately ends up being an overall let down.  If you like fantastical Broadway-type entertainment with no value placed on story, then you will probably like this movie. Otherwise, skip it.\", \"Set in 1959, \\\"The Hudsucker Proxy\\\" has the feel of a 30s comedy, or it seems to be trying to have that feel. There are some great visuals, but the whole thing left me cold. If this was supposed to capture the fun and repartee of the 30s comedies, it failed miserably for me. Lots of those old comedies had some unbelievable stories, but the character development was such that you had some identification with the people. And the actors had such grace and charm (think Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn) that you couldn't help but be captivated. Here the story and characters have no basis in reality whatsoever. And you have Tim Robbins giving a performance that looks like he just got out of acting 101. Paul Newman goes through the motions and Jennifer Jason Leigh does a Katharine Hepburn imitation that made me weep with longing for the real thing. Charles Durning is wasted in his two absurd appearances.  There were so many things in this movie that made me physically cringe that it took some time after it was over to recover my equilibrium. There is a guy who does a parody of Dean Martin in a scene that comes out of nowhere; I asked myself why that scene was in there, and I found myself asking that about most of the scenes in this movie. There is a bellhop who is a Red Buttons clone and is every bit as irritating as the real person. A scene in a beatnik bar is so clich\\u00e9d that I feel ashamed to have seen it.   \\\"The Hudsucker Proxy\\\" did serve one purpose for me and that was to make me realize that those old 30s and 40s comedies are special. They come from a time and a place that can never be duplicated, with actors for whom there is no replacement.  A quote from Paul Newman in this movie summarizes my reaction, \\\"This is embarrassing.\\\"\", \"It's interesting to note, having read some of the comments posted here that cinema does have an influence on people's lives. How could anyone explain why Hudsucker Proxy made some people so enthusiastic unless it be that it reminded them of It's a Wonderfyl Life? Capra's movie was seriously overrated because there is a need around the Christmas holiday for people to feel good, be close to their families and friends and so on, things they generally do bad or unconvincingly around the year. The 40's and 50's which inspired this movie had something that the Coen's didn't have: a good crew of actors.   How can anybody compare Gary Cooper, Carry Grant or Jimmy Stewart with Tim Robbins?His character is badly written. What should I think of him otherwise that he is an imbecile \\\"with a heart\\\". I am appalled at this clich\\u00e9 Hollywood has been throwing at us for decades with the dumb guy that manages to teach the bad guys a lesson, get the girl and save the day. Are we to think that Hollywood encourages people towards tolerance? Don't make me laugh. The story doesn't manage to be more than trivial but some people like it because they are conditioned by years and years of watching junk in the cinema that this is what a masterpiece should look like.   The story is trivial and the fantastic element is embarrassing even for a kids movie, something this could never be given the tendency of most everybody to commit suicide.   The acting is awful, but considering the actors didn't have what to play it's understandable. Tim Robbins is nothing more than a cartoon. What do we know about his feelings, about his background...about him as a HUMAN BEING? He is just a Hollywood clich\\u00e9 supposed to be funny and prompt sympathy. I think Tom and Jerry had more humanity than him. Paul Newman was unbelievable...in a bad way. I don't understand what was in his mind that made him accept this part. He made some good movies in his life, did he really need the money. maybe a subscription for retired actors would have suited him better.  Having seen all the Coen's movies I am left with a bitter taste after this one. Astonishing pair of movie maker, sometimes lamentably fails... Hey even Orson Welles or Kubrick had their drawbacks. This shouldn't discourage anyone from enjoying their movies (I recommend Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink and Fargo). However, seeing their more recent productions such as Intolerable Cruealty or The Man Who Wsn't There I have to notice that their talent seems to slowly go down the drain and maybe they just got lucky a few times.

Now that I have, I can only express my disappointment. I don't think the slightest attempt was made to capture the romance, the passion, and the pure ambience of the story. Now I do concede, as has been said many times, that if a novel is good enough to be made into a movie, it's probably not even worth it. It's old news that the book is always better than the movie. I grant this, but much more still could have been done with it. This movie should have been an homage to the novel, but it was in fact a disgrace.  However, as a film it did have some redeeming qualities. The cinematography was beautiful, the acting superb. Tom Cruise is in his element here (larger-than-life characters) and they don't get much larger than the Vampire Lestat. I cannot envision anyone else take on the role the way he did. Pitt I was surprised and impressed with, though I was doubtful at first of his being cast. Kirsten Dunst shows amazing talent. I have a common gripe \\u0096 Banderas as Armand. Though, incredibly, he does some acting, he's a terrible choice for the part. And I would have liked to hear them all adopt a French accent.  The ending was horrendous, the worst possible example of creative license I have ever seen, and gave an awful impression of the real story.  Definitely read the books; don't bother with the movie if you're looking for more than performance. It is truly not worth it.  \", \"To call Tom Cruise and \\\"actor\\\" is generous at best. He appears in movies, and because he is pretty, people watch. He doesn't have enough talent to occupy minor character roles, and if he weren't so pretty, we would never have heard his name. But he is, and here he is, without enough horsepower to drive Ann Rice's seminal character, Lestat.  But, as bad as Cruise is, he is Olivier compared to Pitt, the other megastar pretty boy non-actor. Pitt can't act his way out of a paper bag, and frankly, if you watch the plastic bag scene in American Beauty, you'll see a bag doing a better job at acting than Pitt will ever do.  Neil Jordan decided to downplay the homosexual aspect of Rice's decadent vampires. Given the meager talent of the two leads, there isn't much left. Cruise and Pitt preen and pose through endless costume scenes and the obligatory vampire touchstones like fangs and blood, and it is mediocre beyond belief.  Thank god for Kirsten Dunst. She is spectacular as Claudia, the young vampire denied the chance to grow up physically, but who becomes more wise and mature than any human adult. Without her, there would be nothing but air.

First, the plot is seriously screwed up. The entire movie is totally unbelievable and abysmal-tastic. (A trip to the Bahamas? Uhhh...) I really wonder about who-the-hell-ever wrote the script. The only thing the movie actually succeeded in doing was showing off Jennifer Love Hewitt's body. This dumb attempt to sell the film quickly becomes stupid and laughably pitiful-licious. The movie's ending was drivel and did *nothing* to explain what had been going on, not to mention how the evil fisherman (ahem) keeps coming back. They could have used the best actors in the world (which they certainly did not), and the \\\"story\\\" still would have dragged this down. So, to sum it up: the acting is beyond stupid, the plot is terrible, and the entire movie is, all-in-all, quite absurd. There are many things that could have been done better, but weren't. I Still Know screams \\\"not good enough.\\\" Rent it if you want a few laughs, but personally I pity anyone who could take this seriously. Like they say, \\\"been there, done that.\\\" And who in the hell think \\\"Ben Willis - the lamest and most insane horror villain to come along in decades!\\\" - ah, forget it!\", \"I went to this movie with the stupid hope that it would be good. Not a chance. Kevin Williamson refused to write the script because he was satisfied with his ending. There is really no reason for this movie, and it is at times boring. Sure, it is a wee bit entertaining, but I was laughing more than anything. In fact, I never got the least bit scared, not even a rapid heart beat. My God, \\\"Showgirls\\\" was scarier than this. The title is outrageous. Wasn't it two summers ago? Or did we stay in the same year. A much better title would have been \\\"I Still Know\\\". And that should've been it. That would have been perfect. Don't blame the creators of this for wanting to make moolah, but please, don't watch this movie. I gave it a 5 out of 10.\", \"Ha! Ha! What a joke. A killer guy in a raincoat goes on a killing rampage is the stupidest idea in the first place. This is the worst movie idea since Uncle Sam.  This film is only scary for little babies. If this movie scares you, you probably get scare so easily.  Come on! This guy kills people with an hook. Thats a big rip-off of the great horror hit, Candyman.  No-- I didn't liked the first movie, I'd think the entire thing about the man in a raincoat with a hook is so stupid in the first place. I've seen horror movies that went only to video is better than this movie.  So, I gave this movie 1/2*\", \"I liked the first movie. This sequel was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The first one actually occasionally made the viewer frightened and feel some suspense. This one was basically just watching the characters be frightened and people being gored to death. I never once felt scared. There is also an amazing lack of humor in it. Whomever wrote it should never write another movie ever again. The actors were sleepwalking through it. Same with the director. The producers should be gauged with a hook. None of these problems were the fault of Jennifer Love Hewitt's breasts though, which is why I rated the film a 2 and not a 1.\", \"What a waste. I was hoping for this film to recreate the kind of claustrophobic terror that was the only reason to watch the first film, but instead, the entire film is an excuse for Jennifer Love Hewitt to show off her body. The plot is so pathetic it's not even worth mentionning; ditto for the script, characters, settings, acting, directing, production values... Brandy Norwood's \\\"performance\\\" here wasn't even worth the money it cost to the producers to fly her to L.A. for a meeting to ask her to star. Her dialogue doesn't make her character seem very stupid, but since she is, she makes everytihng and everyone around her look and act dumb, but once she's gone, they all seem smart. Only Matthew Settle brings any minimal charm to his character, but he does have a lot of the script's worst lines. The mentionned third entry in this series, once again featuring Ben Willis, will confirm this series the 1990s equivalent to \\\"Friday the 13th\\\"... People will be going to see these movies to see who gets mangled, and how badly, not for plot, suspense, character, etc... Grade: F\", \"This film marks the end for the teen horror come back.  In this baffling mess of a film, Jeniffer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Junior return to escape the hook of a fisherman with a new breed of fresh faces all doing their best to get written into a possible sequel. From the beginning you know what going to happen. If you've seen any shlock horror film you'll be ahead of this mess from the beginning. But these criticisms can be explained with the past record of director, Danny Canon. He directed Judge Dredd but even this is new ground for this untalented hack.  There are two redeemable characters in this film and their planted on Jeniffer Love Hewitt's chest. They truly deliver exceptional performances and apart from their occassional freedom the film doesn't add up to much. In an attempt to pull in profit though they are given \\\"ample\\\" of screen time, a factor which encouraged a second viewing on video.   Brandy is the only speaking character that leaves an impression. She is a wasted talent in this movie but the girl fights to rise above the horrible material. The rest of the performances are wooden and simply going through the motions. And what a motion for Hewitt!   Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date with the slow motion button on my VCR. Grade - D+\", \"I can't bear him anymore!  \\\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\\" was OK, specially because of Sarah Michelle Gellar (the most beautiful woman in the whole world). But this sequel is very very bad.  The screenplay is just terrible. I can say the same thing about the actors. Jennifer Love does not convince (one more time) as the silly, boring and annoying girl named Julie. Freddie Prinze Jr. should get real - he's awful! And Brandy should just sing.  There are some scary moments but that's all.  I think I gave a 7 out of 10 for the first film, but this one doesn't deserve more than a 2 out of 10.  I won't be surprised if in the year of 2027 we see something like \\\"I Died On The Last Movie, But Now I'm Alive And I Remember Everything Clearly. So I Continue to Know What You Did 30 Summers Ago\\\".  Rating: 2/10\", \"  Standard, and worthless, sequel to standard original has Hewitt back as Julie James, who is still haunted by the events of the original. When she wins a vacation to the Bahamas, guess who follows her there? Havoc ensues. Death after death proves tiresome after a while, while the usual dumb characters become more annoying as the movie drags on. On the plus side, it has more scary moments than the first one (if you can get through a dreadful first half). Hewitt is excellent as usual, while Brandy brings a freshness to the screen as her best friend. Prinze, Jr. is hardly in the movie until the end (and what a lousy ending!). RATING: 4 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and strong language.\", \"I should have (still) known or remembered what a poor movie the first 'Summer' was. 'I still know' makes the original seem like a classic. I wouldn't even know where to begin picking this one apart. Why can't the producers hire some decent writers, I know you are supposed to suspend your belief when watching horror movies but it would be nice to see a more believable plot and maybe a few better written characters.  Jennifer Love Hewitt is certainly easy on the eye and Im sure she has more talent than the filmmakers allowed her in 'I still know' Shes pretty much reduced to walking around aimlessly wearing as many low-cut, two sizes too small T-shirts as the makers can cram into an hour and a half of film.  George Romero's 'Dead' series and 'Candyman' aside I dont ever recall any strong black characters in a horror film, Moesha & the fella out of 'High School High''s character's were terrible. It's got be insulting to the Afro-American community when they are mostly portrayed as Jive talking, foul mouthed and overly horny people in this type of movie.  As for the horror element? well... need I say more than killers walking around with plastic cable ties in their pockets in case they want to 'suntan' a pretty young girl to death on a sunbed. Did anyone ever think of simply reaching out and turning off the sunbed's power during all the screaming and panicking in this ludicrous scene. This series is truly looking like its going to be the 'Friday the 13th' of the 90's. The worrying reality is that its just as stale and crap.  \", \"I hope this is the end of all the Scream rip-offs. So much hype and nothing to show for it\\u0085what a disappointing flick.You guys want 4 lines, and this film is not worth even that. Moesha, you can do so much better than this. Jennifer Love Hewitt I don't know what's the big deal with you. Please, no more!!\", \"This movie is a crock of garbage, folks. It's movies like this that give true horror films a bad name. Nothing is good about this movie except the highly attractive and extremely beautiful Jennifer Love Hewitt. Other than her, you wish this movie would take a long walk off of a short pier. Nothing except JLH could save this sorry excuse of a movie, and it's also a waste of your time and a waste of film to make the movie with. Get this for a FREE rental only. DO NOT buy it. I guarantee that you will be sorry\", \"Oh geez! What the hell were they thinking when they came up with this one? This is one of the most... stupid movies I've ever seen. This is absolutely nothing below-average direct-to-video 80s slasher-crap made in the 90s. I swear, I think Columbia Pictures must have had about 10-million dollars laying around the studio that they didn't know what to do with, so they made this piece of garbage.  The story, oh geez the story, is just so out-there unbelievable. GET READY FOR SOME SPOILERS, THOUGH I MUST SAY IT ISN'T SPOILING MUCH. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Brandy win a trip to a sorry tourist island by answering the radio station question \\\"What is the capital of Brazil?\\\" with \\\"Rio.\\\" Oh please! I'm not going to lie, I'm a pretty smart person, but anyone with a sense of geography knows that just ain't right. Brasilia, dammit! Like a person that has been faking his death for a year would manage to dig up the money to send four people to the Bahamas. Yeah sure. I'm going to get revenge on the people (a pair of whom are dead) that hit-and-run me two years ago by sending them on a bit of a vacation first. What a nice serial killer am I? STUPID! Which reminds me, why is it called \\\"I Still Know What You Did LAST Summer\\\"? Sorry, Ben Willis, you're a couple of years behind. Anyway, for a reason I have yet to figure out, Jennifer Love Hewitt runs in the rain wearing a sweater and bikini bottom to tell Brandy and the rest of the victims that she ran over Ben Willis 2 years prior and that he went after her and Ray and killed 2 of her friends last year. In one seen, that I think is incredibly stupid, Jennifer's character is in a tanning machine when the psychotic Gordon's fisherman locks her in with one of those cable ties and turns the machine to full blast. As stupid as her friends are, they waste time breaking the machine when they could simply pull the plug. HELLO? Anyway, people die, killer dies, the end. And if that ain't bad enough, now we have the cast.  Jennifer Love Hewitt, as lovely as she and her assets are, is not enough to save this film. Neither are Freddie Prinze Jr. and Mekhi Pheifer, who, despite the terrible story, do a good job. And as for Brandy, oh poor Brandy, as much as I like her music, the girl can't cut it (no pun intended) in cinema. Sorry girl, stick to your day job.  Basically, this is a terrible film that only has 2 good points: a scene that I must admit surprised me, and 2 likeable characters, and no I don't mean Jennifer's breasts. For these two highlights and the fact that this gives people who like bad movies another one to watch, I give the film a 2/10. If you must see it, I suggest you wait until someone else rents it from the 99-cent rack and mooch off of them.\", \"This is the worst scary movie I have ever seen! The first one was good, but what the hell happened when they made this one. I mean, come on! How scary is it when a man runs around (or should I say, WALKS around) and kills characters that only have 2 lines, or less. And the end is really sad. not boo hoo sad, just sad! Julie shot the man like 7 times and he still has enough energy to not die, follow her to her house, crawl under a chair (like he would fit), and then pull her under it! I'm sorry But this movie sucks! I Know What I Did Last Summer when I watched this movie... I slept!\", \"Captain Hook's retarded cousin Ben Willis comes back to finish of everybody except Julie,in case this film would become a hit,you know.He immediately thinks of a plan so cunning,so genius,so brilliant...no wait,my bad,it's the worst plan ever.  Willis apparently found out where Julie lives and where she goes to school.Immediately,he goes to get his son out of nowhere and gets him to go to the same school and make friends with Julie.Then he fakes a radio show(I think)and lets Julie and her roommate,played by Brandy of all people,win it by guessing the capital of Brazil(to win a trip to the Bahamas,is this still making sense to you?).Meanwhile,Julie's old boyfriend who now has the promising career of ah,fish gutter or something,has to be eliminated so Willis throws a dummy in front of his car and then doesn't kill him,making room for his son who got the weird pseudonym Will Benson(wouldn't it be safer to give him a name that doesn't contain Will,Ben or son?He should have given him a name that's harder to figure out,like John Killer)and they all head to the Bahamas.So Ben is now paying for their holidays or something?Yeah,that'll teach them.  When they arrive,turns out it's the rain season.Why would a radio station give people tickets to the Bahamas in the rain season?Can't they just like,call the station and try to change the date or something?Freddie Prinze Jr.(he has a name,but unlike Ben,I don't still know)also heads for the Bahamas right after waking up from a coma or something to save the day and he kills Ben once and for all,after Ben killed his own son by accident,cos he apparently never watched pro-wrestling.  So the happy bunch returns and then Ben attacks Julie in her apartment.I hate to be a wise-ass,but why didn't he do that all along?Why putting in the whole Bahama-thing,which actually complicated everything?On the other hand,I didn't go to psychopatic weirdo-university.My parents were all like,we think it's too expensive for learning so little. This movie is utterly insane,but amazingly,I still don't like it.It's just hard to enjoy a movie about Jennifer Love Hewitt not being killed I guess.\", \"*I Still Know What You Did Last Summer... I read The SPOILERS*   Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt, who is as one-expressioned and scenery-chewer in this as she is in 'Ghost Whisperer') has changed college from the first movie, and is still obsessed with The Fisherman (Muse Watson, who has been given way better material in 'Prison Break' and 'NCIS'), who pays her a visit in the Campus' Disco (hey, Fishermen just wanna have fun!). In the meanwhile her Match-Made-In-Heaven Ray (Freddy Prinze Jr., whose status as the best actor of the bunch says much about the other thespians involved) is not going to be with her for whatever reason, and her friend Karla (Brandi Norwood, who is as insipid an actress as she is a singer) wins a trip to Bahamas for four people by answering a question which asked her which was the capital of Brazil (Brazilia) WRONG, and she does not see anything wrong with that, nor does she understand she gave the wrong answer.  Karla brings her boyfriend (Mekhi Phifer, who plays basically the same character he will play on 'ER' a few years later, and just as annoyingly), and Julie brings friend Will Benson (Benson - Ben's Son, geddit?) (Matthew Settle, who really did his best in a thankless role), since Ray is unaccounted.  But when they get on the island, it's rain season, and as the killer murders... people we don't give a darn about (which could very well mean any character), including a scary rastafarian Mary Jane smoker (Jack Black?), our core four begin to find out they should have paid attention in First Grade Geography Class, and begin to act stupid (if they ever stopped), which leads to the most stupid scary movie I ever had the displeasure to watch, and to a good thing; Mekhi Phifer's and Jennifer Esposito's characters' death.  Then the killer gets Julie, and she has the most unbelievable fight ever - Miss Fraily Girl managing to overpower two strong men? Big no no...  By the way, why take the characters out to Bahamas to kill them? Why not murdering them on the spot? And why did The Fisherman not kill Ray? One more question: why did Mandalay greenly this script? It has been written by someone who didn't know anything about writing stories, much less screenplays.  In short, this movie deserves completely the title it has been given in Italy: 'Incubo Finale' ('Final Nightmare'), because it IS a nightmare of a movie, and to use a pun, it's not a horror movie, but a horror of a movie.  The Fisherman is cool, though. I was rooting for him in this movie.  I Still Know What You Did Last Summer: 1/10.\", \"One of the disadvantages of films no longer having all the credits at the beginning is that you now have to wait till the end for clues that the film in question may suck - the appalling film of \\\"The Saint\\\" a few years ago had Leslie Charteris' name nowhere in sight, and similarly \\\"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer\\\" credits neither Kevin Williamson (writer of the first film) nor Lois Duncan (author of the book that it was based on), although they could both lay claim to having originated certain characters. Perhaps they declined to have anything to do with it on seeing the script by Trey Callaway, who also had a hand in the mercifully short-lived ER-in-space TV show \\\"Mercy Point.\\\"  And I can't blame them if they did - the first film was no classic but I can see why it was a hit (it did have some real jolts, it was less self-referential than other recent fright flicks, and the pairing of Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar was a gift to guys everywhere, even if SMG did get killed). But this time it's idiocy all the way, from the title (the most inaccurate title for a sequel since \\\"Rambo III\\\") to the climax featuring the world's only six-shooter that fires eight bullets, while Danny Cannon's direction and John Frizzell's score duke it out to see which is the most OTT (the music wins). And the ending may as well have had the words \\\"Julie James will return in 'I Still Know What You Did Three Summers Ago'\\\" splattered across the screen - it would have been more subtle.  Jennifer Esposito is good as the bartender in the karaoke bar, though it's hard not to think \\\"She left 'Spin City' for THIS?\\\" - and at least we were spared Brandy singing over the credits (for those of you who leave before the end, Jennifer Love Hewitt does that job). But basically this is a waste of time for fans of good movies, although the delicious Miss Hewitt is as fanciable as ever (which is why I gave this film 2 out of 10 instead of 1).\", \"I'm looking at all of the positive comments made for \\\"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer\\\" and I have one question: Where are your brains? This movie was absolutely horrendous, an insult to the intelligence, without any wit, logic, or reason for being.  Let's start with all the holes in the plot: How did Ben Willis know where Julie's boyfriend (Freddie Prinze Jr.) was going to be driving? Why did Ben Willis pay so much money to drag Julie and company all the way to the Bahamas only to kill everyone else there, and especially if he had access to kill Julie the whole time she was at school? Are there really exact days that resorts in the Bahamas have a hurricane season? How could the filmmakers believe that audiences are so witless as to not know that the capital of Brazil is NOT Rio de Janeiro? If Ben had access to Julie's room the WHOLE time, why didn't he just kill her? Why did that voodoo guy return to the hotel after we saw him start to escape off the island? Why didn't Julie ax Ben Willis when he was trying to break through the door? And what is with that pathetic ending?  Oh, there are so many questions I had about this movie and to no avail. After awhile, I realized that I was putting more thought to the film than the makers did! The filmmakers were so bankrupt of imagination that I guess they had to settle for just killing everyone off that wasn't essential to the story (a la Friday the 13th). This movie has no reason for being, only to pocket the money of those unfortunate enough to sit through this mess. If the movie was a bore to sit through, the ending was infuriating. It totally demonstated that the filmmakers have absolutely no regard for the audience and Jennifer Love's character all along. Nothing is worse than the old is a dream sequence or not? routine. The \\\"surprise\\\" in the film was only a surprise for people who lack the intelligence of putting a 10 piece jigsaw puzzle together.\", \"I must say teen slashers used to have some appeal, but this film probably hit the lowest of the Hollywood lows. The only redeeming factor of the entire film was the fact that Jennifer Love Hewitt is in it, giving it some aesthetic appeal at least. But then the story gets under way and it's the most predictable thing EVER. The acting was horrendous, the plot pointless and the gore non-existent. In every one of these dumb slasher flicks there's a scene where the murderer is down for the count and can easily be taken advantage of, but for some reason unknown to man, the \\\"good guys\\\" don't seem to realise this. But \\\"I Still Know what you did last summer\\\" has possibly the worst one I have ever seen. What it lacks in gore it definitely makes up for in logic...oh wait no, they have NONE! Here's the situation, the murderer has fallen through a ceiling or something and he's unconscious. One of the girls has a great big fire axe in her hand. What would most sensible humans do? That's right, swing that axe lots and lots of times, making sure his head and body are separate entities, and why not his limbs as well. BUT NO! She doesn't do anything of the sort, instead she uses the axe to break into a greenhouse and then...THROWS IT AWAY. Clever girl! She may be dead but at least she got the moral high-ground.   N.B. If you're ever stuck in a slasher situation, KILL the murderer when you get chance, and use a bit of logic. Then again if that happened the film would last about 15 minutes, which would definitely have been a good thing.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Isle of the Dead\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0037820\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"While I'm a large fan of horror and Karloff, this one failed to really hook me.

While quarantined on a Greek island, the Plague is not the only thing you have to fear. This chilling story does its job in short order...72 minutes. Great half of a double feature.  Mark Robson directs and Boris Karloff leads the cast that includes Ellen Drew and Jason Robards, Sr.\", \"This picture contains a few nice atmospheric bits, but nothing much happens. There's very little tension, and what there is comes only at the very end.  More could have been done with the mythic Greek elements of the story, rather than falling back on Edgar Allan Poe's \\\"The Premature Burial\\\". I'd recommend this picture only to hardcore Karloff fans and aficionados of Val Lewton (although many Lewton fans agree that this is one his weaker pictures).  Definitely not one to keep you on the edge of your seat, but not exactly boring.  One bit doesn't make sense. Karloff comes to the island with the journalist, and then destroys the rowboat to keep everyone from escaping. How did the rest of the people get there? Well, let's assume he wrecked the other boats, too, although one of the characters says, \\\"He's wrecked the only boat on the island!\\\"\", \"The 1945 Val Lewton ISLE OF THE DEAD is, regrettably, aptly titled: the film itself is a dead, awkward thing and largely devoid of the style that made such Lewton films as CAT PEOPLE, I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, and THE BODY SNATCHER so memorable.  The story concerns a 19th century Greek military commander (Karloff) who visits his wife's grave, located on an island described as a cemetery. But plague breaks out--and in order to prevent its spread the commander quarantines the island. Even as various residents fall ill and die, others attribute the deaths to a Greek-style vampire; to further complicate the story a premature burial leaves the prematurely buried considerably annoyed, to say the least.  The basic problem here is the script, credited to Josef Mishel and Ardel Wray: the dialogue is incredibly awkward and the overall story is at best vague, at worst incomprehensible. Karloff, having just given the performance of his career in the earlier THE BODY SNATCHER, now gives what may be his weakest performance of the 1940s with this film--and frankly he looks incredibly ridiculous with curly hair. But Karloff is not alone: the entire cast is truly at sea, their performances clashing at every possible stylistic level, and director Mark Robson is unable to chart any direction that might give these issues any interest.  Lewton was greatly admired for his skill in turning low budgets into memorable horror films with unexpected poet flourishes; he was, without doubt, one of the few genius producers of the 20th century. But ISLE OF THE DEAD does him no credit. Although it will be a must-see for Lewton and Karloff fans, they will be tremendously disappointed--and all others are warned off.  Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer\", \"The filming of this picture was interrupted on two occasions, one from an old back injury, Karloff was rushed to the hospital for an emergency spinal operation and Actress Rose Hobart was replaced in the role of the cataleptic (Mrs. St. Aubyn) by Katherine Emery. This so called \\\"horror\\\" film had a great lack of action and was a drag, even its suspense only mildly was interesting. Even Boris Karloff fans will note the tired way he performs through the entire film. This picture takes place during Balkan War of 1912, General Pherides (Boris Karloff) rows to a tiny Grecian island to visit the grave of his wife. Oliver Davis (Marc Cramer), an American newspaperman, accompanies him. After finding the coffin looted by thieves, they accept lodging in the household of Albrecht (Jason Robards Sr.,) father of Jason Robards Jr. an antique collector. But they soon discover plague has infested the island. Kyra (Helene Thimig), superstitious old crone, believes Thea (Ellen Drew), an attractive Greek girl, is a vampire and responsible for the deaths. This film is not one of Karloff's best performances. However, it is a Classic and a must see film for all Karloff fans !\", \"I saw this film a couple of years ago as a young teenager. I enjoyed it, and remembered it, but never really realized the full effect of the delightful terror in it. I saw it again today (shocked that I was able to find it at a local library), and I have been totally and completely blown away. This film boasts one of the most imaginative and solid plotlines I've ever seen in a shock flick. In the first twenty minutes, there is really nothing to distinguish it as a \\\"horror\\\" movie, more as a kind of suspense thriller. But the writers take the story into a whole other realm of reality, and this results in the most satisfying and eerily spooky thriller that you can imagine. A rare gem also, in that the film is practically unmentioned now. But despite its age, it surprisingly isn't in the least bit dated or campy, which many Karloff pictures have become, at least in the minds of the more close-minded horror buffs who wouldn't touch a vintage piece like this one with a ten-foot pole. Sad, really. If Hollywood still had the capacity to produce quality films like this, motion pictures would see another Golden Age. At any rate, do yourself a favor and sample this macabre bill of fare! It's almost certainly to be worth your while.\", \"Boris Karloff gives a good performance as General Feredes,one of several people he quarantines on a small island where his wife is buried. Suspense builds as each person is struck-down and the superstition of Feredes begins to grow,fuelled by the malevolent housekeeper. An interesting sub-plot is that one of the victims suffers from catatonic trances,and is mistakenly buried alive. Claustrophobic and atmospheric,guaranteed to send a shiver down your spine.\", \"I saw this movie when I was a teenager and totally dedicated to being scared by most horror films I saw. This movie, I well remember, gave me some great chills which built to the end.  I bought the DVD recently, especially for Halloween--which of course, it arrived 3 days after. Anyway, I was not disappointed with the movie. It moved along nicely from somewhat sinister settings and a mismatch of people who become isolated due to the threat of plague. The man in charge, a Greek general (well played by Boris Karloff) takes over when he suspects the possibility of passing the illness to his troops on the mainland. What interested me most was not that the picture wasn't as well done as I originally thought, but that the characters had so much more depth than I imagined. The general was not an evil tyrant and the housekeeper was not an old witch egging him on out of her envy toward the lovely, young woman. She still seems like an old witch, but this time around I felt her belief in the supernatural and understood her fears which she passed along to the general who had been brought up with the same superstitions. As the first victim succumbs to a mysterious illness and then his wife apparently dies of the same the general's mind becomes affected by the old ways and he falls prey to imagination.  It was not the all-out scary picture I remembered, but it was certainly well done (good old Val Lewton and company). It moved along smoothly and swiftly and built to a very rational and chilling end. I enjoyed it immensely.\", \"Boris Karloff stars as a Greek general in 1912, trapped on an island in quarantine with a house full of people trying to avoid the plague. And is there an evil spirit at work also? This film is a horrifying journey from reason and faith to superstition descending into madness. Wonderful performances by all, but especially Karloff, help to carry this movie. But the setting and the camera work do wonders as well. From a gritty, yet realistic and lighter background initially to a much more dark and Gothic atmosphere in keeping with the story line and the characters' mental state, reminiscent of the subtle, yet terrifying atmosphere of Cat People, the mood of the film is both effective and frightening.  I can think of few things worse than being quarantined after exposure to a deadly pestilence with limited medical resources...relying only on hope to save me, which quickly turns to despair as those around me fall into the darkness. Or the horror, which would almost certainly drive me mad, of being buried alive.  Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and will definitely watch it again.\", \"From watching Val Lewton's films, it seems that he was fascinated with dichotomies. For example:  \\\"Cat People\\\" explores self-repression vs. uninhibited passion. \\\"Curse of the Cat People\\\" explores reality vs. fantasy. \\\"The 7th Victim\\\" explores the desire to live vs. the desire to die.  Lewton's movies are usually very rich in these psychological themes, but \\\"Isle of the Dead\\\" may explore more dichotomies than any of his other pictures. Here are just a few of the themes dealt with:  *protection vs. domination *cold-hearted rationalism vs. illogical compassion *science vs. superstition *faith vs. superstition *fighting fate/death vs. accepting fate/death *control vs. helplessness  As far as the story is concerned, General Nikolas Pherides (Boris Karloff) and reporter Oliver Davis (Marc Kramer) follow a pleasant and mysterious singing woman's voice to a remote house. Their interaction with the house's occupants generates an eerie, compelling story. I won't give away anything more than to say the plot revolves around the superstition of the Vorvolaka--a Greek \\\"nightmare figure\\\", as the Foreword describes it, that can slowly drain the life from its victim(s) and even cause plagues and epidemics in a community.  I don't know how many dozens of Boris Karloff films I've seen, but this is one of my favorites. In \\\"Isle of the Dead\\\" he is never someone we are allowed to identify with, but he still manages to make us understand his every action. His character undergoes several developments, and they all seem perfectly logical and understandable within the context of this twisted character's worldview.  Though no one in the film really seems Greek--more American and British, in fact--it doesn't really matter where the film takes place or what culture it's in. This is a secluded world that only exists in the movies, but it's a powerful world that forces us to confront our fears in a very real way.  \\\"Isle of the Dead\\\" isn't a monster film or a jolting shock-you-out-of-your-seat jolt-a-minute horror movie, but it's definitely creepy, unsettling, and even scary at times. Is writing is at a much higher calibre than most horror movies, and if you let yourself really get into the story and contemplate the ideas presented, you will find yourself captivated.\", \"This horror movie is quite typical for '40's standards. Horror movies from the '40's were often movies that were slow in its build up and also most often picked a realistic approach, with its unlikely subjects. It also often implied more than it actually showed on the screen. \\\"Isle of the Dead\\\" is just a movie like that and for the fans of the genre simply a great one to watch.  The concept is kept quite simple but it works out effective, when a small group needs to remain in quarantine on an island, when a mysterious deadly plague suddenly sets in. The movie often implies a lot and the movie spend most of its time building up things, which in the long run might make this movie a bit unsatisfying for the average viewer (because not a lot is happening) but for those who are familiar and like these type of movies it's quite rewarding movie. Certainly not the best that the genre has to offer but it's simply all good enough.  Of course the movie is also being uplifted by the fact that it has Boris Karloff in the main lead. Once again he proofs that he actually was a great actor, who got stuck in the horror genre. Who knows, maybe otherwise he would had been respected more for his talents, had he starred also in some acclaimed drama's and such.  It's a movie that relies mostly on its atmosphere and main concept and it does this well. \\\"Isle of the Dead\\\" might not be a classic, it certainly is still a fine example of '40's horror.  7/10\", \"Boris Karloff's name is what brought me to this picture, and without him, I think, the film might have been just another B movie programmer from the Forties. I've just learned a little about producer Val Lewton, and their collaboration here is what gives the picture some of it's momentum. While watching however, I never really got the impression that this was going to be much of a horror film. Yes, there's mention of evil spirits and malignant forces, and even a word about the dreaded vorvolaka, an undead vampire-like creature that's part of Greek folklore. But even with a mysterious Madame Kyra (Helen Thimig) professing such belief, and others in the story buying into it, the production makes it pretty plain that the reason folks are in danger is because of a plague that has infected the island. The attempt to link Thea (Ellen Drew) to malevolent forces didn't really work for me, she was just too wholesome and good looking to imply a serious threat. That role should probably have gone to Madame Kyra, perfect for someone warning about vorvolakas to actually be possessed by one.  What works best I guess is the way General Pherides (Karloff) slowly unravels from a man of strong principal and belief in science to a mad man intent on eliminating a superstition come to life. It's that psychological aspect to the drama that holds more water than the implied horror component, even if Mrs. St. Aubyn escapes from her coffin. Enough explanation revealed her bouts with cataleptic trances and fear of being buried alive to make that an expected part of the story, and one would presume that that was enough to put her over the edge with the old Poseidon sword.  Nevertheless the film is enjoyable on a number of levels; for one, lovers of old films will delight in the great ambiance of an isolated, wind swept island and the dark, moody atmosphere of the Albrecht home. The characters never wear out their welcome, and as others on this board have suggested, those that might have make an early exit. Be prepared though for a Karloff you haven't seen before, all the while I just couldn't get used to seeing him in a military uniform with curly hair.\", \"Just watched this, the second of Boris Karloff's collaborations with producer Val Lewton, on YouTube. Karloff plays General Nikolas Pherides who is visiting, with American reporter Oliver Davis (Marc Cramer), a Greek isle in which his wife was buried. Turns out the graves were opened with many bodies burned due to the war situation. Also there is a plague that causes a quarantine of the house the General and Davis are staying in which also houses a man named Albrecht (Jason Robards, Sr.), an army physician named Dr. Drossos (Ernst Deutsch), a married couple (Alan Napier and Katherine Emery), a superstitious woman named Madame Kyra (Helene Thimig), and a beautiful young woman named Thea (Ellen Drew) who takes care of the invalid named Mary St. Aubyn played by Ms. Emery. I'll stop there and just say what a compellingly atmospheric drama this was especially near the end. Karloff himself plays a much more sympathetic role whose decent into partial madness is understandable here. Everyone else here also provide their own moments. Director Mark Robson, like other Lewton filmmakers Jacques Tourneur and Robert Wise, provides just the right touch of suspense to keep one riveted. So on that note, I highly recommend Isle of the Dead.\", \"Isle Of The Dead is set on a Greek isle during the First Balkan War in 1912\\u00961913. When General Nikolas \\\"The Watchdog\\\" Pherides (Boris Karloff) and American war correspondent Oliver Davis (Marc Cramer) visit the isle, they find that Pherides' wife's tomb has been desecrated and the body gone. Upon hearing the sweet singing of a female they are led to a household consisting of the Aubin's, St & Mary (Alan Napier & Katherine Emery), Mary's nursemaid Thea (Ellen Drew), archaeologist Albrecht (Jason Robards) & his housekeeper Kyra (Helene Thimig), and salesman Andrew Robbins (Skelton Knaggs). As the talk turns to a mysterious Greek vampire called a vorvolaka being responsible for bad deeds on the isle, a septicaemic plague breaks out. Pherides sends for Dr Drossos (Ernst Dorian) and promptly quarantines all on the isle. But as the group wait and hope for the wind to come and blow the plague away, death and madness starts to take a hold.  We open with a scene in Pherides' shadowy tented command point. Dark unflinching eyes stare out at the soldier in front of him, Pherides doesn't utter a word, he merely pushes a pistol forward, holding his gaze. The soldier takes up the pistol and leaves the tent, the outcome we know from Pherides' manner is obvious. The moody marker has been set, this is a Val Lewton {producer} & Mark Robson {director} picture.  Working from a script from Ardel Wray that was inspired by Arnold B\\u00f6cklin's painting of the same name, this was the fourth of five pictures Robson directed for Lewton, and the first of three pictures that Karloff made with the talented producer. Originally titled \\\"Camilla,\\\" the production was not without problems. Karloff suffered a back problem that required surgery and thus delayed the film for a while and a central female character called Catharine was jettisoned from the original script. So not without problems it seems, but it doesn't show because Isle Of The Dead ended up as an atmospheric pot boiler dripping with the sense of unease so synonymous with the Lewton/Robson partnership.  No doubt about it, this is a very talky piece, with the makers choosing fright suggestion and mooted superstition over actual actions for the most part; with Robson deliberately keeping the pace claustrophobic-ally sedate. It all then comes alive with horror relish as a premature burial {the audience are aware of this fact} brings about an upturn in pace. Which simultaneously gives the horror genre one of its best and most unsettling sequences from the 1940s. We then blend seamlessly into the last quarter of the piece where the mystery and horror unfolds amid shocks and hypnotic like fulfilment. 8/10\", \"Leaving his Frankenstein monster portrayal behind, Boris Karloff shows in this film that he can act and do a good job of it. He plays a Greek General trapped on an island with others fighting the plague.  A young girl, Thea (Ellen Drew) is thought to be a vrykolaka, a harmful undead creature in Greek folklore, by an old peasant woman (Helen Thimig). It has similarities to many different legendary creatures, but is generally equated with the vampire of the folklore of the neighbouring Slavic countries. While the two are very similar, blood-drinking is only marginally associated with the vrykolakas.  The tale is a mixture of folktale and virus, of medicine and miracles, of superstition and madness. Karloff carried the film with marginal assistance from the others. Worth a watch to see his acting.\", \"I do like Val Lewton's films. This one begins in an interesting setting with a war correspondent talking to a military man, Boris Karloff. He is a cruel and driven man, a total follower of military rule. Through a series of circumstances, a group of people end up quarantined from the plague. Karloff asserts his military power, forcing the people to do as he says, but some don't have the \\\"proper\\\" respect. He also shows himself to be very superstitious, believing in some old Greek werewolf stories. He directs his attention toward a young woman who defies him and gets people to believe that she is sort of an angel of death. As people begin to expire, he gains more and more power, but there is another woman who is, for all practical purposes, his equal. The movie is a moody portrayal of what people can do to each other when they are frightened. It's a good role for Karloff and comes off reasonably well.\", \"***SPOILERS*** Owing much to Edgar Allan Poe (as do several of his \\\"budget\\\" pictures), Val Lewton's production of ISLE OF THE DEAD has it all: the fear of premature burial, the fear of contagion, the fear of the undead; the fear of madness... Center stage (which is exactly where he belonged all along) is Boris Karloff. Not for the final time does he steal the show in a Lewton production. Hardened by the horrors of war (including the plague that follows close on its heels), his character is driven to the brink of... Well, see for yourself. Suffice it to say that the \\\"Lewton unit\\\" strikes gold again. As absorbing (and as unique) as its predecessors, ISLE OF THE DEAD belongs among the first rank of fright films.\", \"\\\"Isle of the Dead\\\" was the second of three films that Boris Karloff made for famed producer Val Lewton in 1945-46. It has all of the Lewton trademarks, darkness and shadows, mystery, horror and good performances. The film was directed by Mark Robson but follows Lewton's proved path to success. The film has an aura of impending death throughout. It also has more on screen violence than most Lewton films but it still manages to play with the audience's emotions and imagination.  The film opens during the Balkan War of 1912 in a Greek army camp commanded by General Nikolas Pherides (Karloff). There is a particular gruesome scene here as the General walks through the camp. We see wagon loads of dead soldiers being drawn by other soldiers to a mass burial. It seems that a deadly plague is sweeping across the country.  Located on an island across from the camp is an island on which Pherides' wife is buried. During a lull in the war, General Pherides and a reporter Oliver Davis (Marc Cramer) row over to the island. There, they are drawn to the haunting voice of a young woman.  Investigating, the pair come upon the home of an antique collector named Albrecht (Jason Robards Sr.) who offers the men lodging for the night. There they meet the St. Aubyns, British diplomats (Alan Napier, Katherine Emery), a young girl, whose voice was heard earlier, Thea (Ellen Drew) and a mysterious old lady named Madame Kyra (Helene Thimig).  When St. Aubyn falls ill, Pherides sends for his medical officer, Dr. Drossos (Ernest Drossos). The doctor diagnoses the illness as the plague and the diplomat soon dies. The General quarantines the island allowing none to leave. We learn that Mrs. St. Aubyn is susceptible to cataleptic seizures and that she has been befriended by Thea. Madame Kyra believes that Thea is a vampire and that she is responsible for the plague on the island. She manages to raise doubts in the mind of the General who confronts the young girl one night in one of the film's key scenes.  More deaths occur including the \\\"apparent\\\" death of Mrs. St. Aubyn. When she awakes..................  Lewton and Robson again play on the audience's fear of the unknown. Is Thea really a vampire? Is Mrs. St. Aubyn really dead? and the ultimate fear of being buried alive.  Karloff gives another outstanding performance as General Pherides, who tries to be the protector of the small group. Of the rest of the cast, Helene Thimig as the superstitious Madame Kyra and Katherine Emery as Mrs. St. Aubyn, stand out.  Followed by Lewton's final RKO \\\"B\\\" horror film, \\\"Bedlam\\\" (1946).\", \"I'm still not quite sure what I saw in Isle of the Dead. I do know it succeeded in giving me the willies.  Several people gather on Greek Island during the Balkan Wars when a type of plague strikes and folks die one by one. One old peasant woman, Helene Thimig suspects young and pretty Ellen Drew of being a monster called a Vorvola which was part of the old Greek religion of Zeus and the rest of the folks from Olympus. The problem is that she gets old Greek general Boris Karloff, a brooding and suspicious man to start with, believing it as well.  Imagine Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None laced with the atmosphere of a horror film and you've got Isle of the Dead. At the end of the film you're not even sure what's happened, but the mood created in you by producer Val Lewton will linger on.  I'm not sure what a guy like Val Lewton would have done with a big budget in a studio like MGM or Paramount. Those recycled RKO sets with the proper sinister lighting were a signature with him.  So was there a Vorvola? Watch and judge for yourself.\", \"This slow, moody little film is more an interesting set of character studies than a horror movie. The script is thoughtful, and the players, especially Katherine Emery as the British consul's wife, Ernst Dorian as the military doctor, and Jason Robards, Sr. as the archaeologist, are all pretty good. Karloff tends to take the stage most of the time with a quiet, but riveting performance as a Greek general slowly crumbling into madness. An excellent performance by Helene Thimig as a sarcastic, bitter old peasant woman, is remarkable for the way she arouses intense dislike in the viewer, and yet is a believable, human sort of villain. The film's atmosphere is dark and filled with gloom, appropriately reflected in the foreboding cinematography. Practically all the action takes place at night, on the confined space of a small island. The sense of fear and hopeless dependence on fate to rescue the trapped people is extremely well portrayed. Not a true classic, perhaps, but well worth seeing.\", \"This seems to me to be unjustly neglected among Lewton's oeuvre; likewise, Boris Karloff's performance here is one of his most underrated. I've always loved the film and, while I concede that it moves rather slowly, the atmosphere it conjures up is simply marvelous (Jack Mackenzie's cinematography is outstanding) - with the island setting recalling I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE (1943), but given added strangeness by being played out against a backdrop of war.  Its central situation - that of a stranded group of people fighting the elements (in this case, the plague) and a dangerous enemy (the vampire-like Vorvoloka who saps their energies) - has been done to death since, but at the time it was still relatively fresh (and may well have been inspired by John Ford's classic Western STAGECOACH [1939], especially in the way the heroine is shunned by some members for her 'corrupting influence'). The vampire lore put forward here is certainly one of the most original approaches to this perennial theme in classic horror cinema - and its presentation is undoubtedly among the most literate and engrossing ever. Actually, the film looks forward to \\\"The Wurdalak\\\" - the episode in Mario Bava's compendium-film BLACK SABBATH (1963) which stars Karloff himself!   The film also takes care to throw in a favorite Poe element - premature burial - for good measure; of course, this added flourish pays off in spades in the form of a terrific - and quite unsettling - finale. Besides, the deliberate pace does allow for well-rounded characterizations (in all the major parts): especially interesting is the relationship between the Greeks (Karloff and the sinister Helene Thimig allowing superstition to get the better of them, thus distrusting and ultimately threatening innocent Ellen Drew), and also that between paganism (as represented by Jason Robards Sr., who lights a pyre to appease the old gods so that they ward off the plague) vs. science (as represented by Ernst Deutsch, who eventually succumbs to the disease himself). Unusual for horror films at the time - but typically for Lewton - special consideration is given to the feminine roles: the afore-mentioned Drew and Thimig, but even more so Katherine Emery (playing a character suffering from a particular 'ailment' and who comes to the fore during the climax, lending it unexpected irony - especially with Karloff's final remark, \\\"I've seen the Vorvoloka!\\\").  Unfortunately, the side of the disc which houses this title is completely bare-bones: the most regrettable aspect to this Box Set, apart from the somewhat disappointing transfers (including this one), is the fact that ISLE OF THE DEAD does not have an accompanying Audio Commentary; for a rarely-seen film like THE GHOST SHIP (1943), which is not even really horror to begin with, that's quite understandable - but Karloff's involvement and the vampiric theme here should have provided ample material for discussion (is it possible there are few admirers of this one, then - Lewton himself, reportedly, considered it \\\"a complete mess\\\"?!)...\", \"For my money this is one of producer Val Lewton's greatest pieces and is, I fear, strangely undervalued. We often hear of great moments in 1942's 'Cat People'; most specifically the swimming pool sequence and an almost heart stopping moment involving a scary walk and a bus or we may further be reminded of great scenes of psychological terror in Lewton's other movies, notably 'I walked With a Zombie'(1943) and 'The Body Snatcher' (1945), but we seldom hear of the sense of impending doom and escalating terror evoked during 'Isle of the Dead' which comes to head when we realise that one of the primary characters has been buried alive and it's her consequent insanity blended perfectly with an eruption of repressed superstition that chills the viewer in the final fifteen or so minutes. Indeed this sequence was only ever equalled once; towards the end of Corman's 1960 'House of Usher' which dealt in part with similar themes. Boris Karloff acquits himself well as the troubled General Pherides, a man who has attempted to detach himself from aspects of his own past and that of his country but for whom spectres of both will arise to haunt him before he inevitably joins the soul of his long departed wife on their lonely island cemetery. Robson's direction, apart from the brilliant scare moments, may seem little more than adequate but successive viewings suggest a gradual and intentional turning of the screw with only one or two really pedestrian scenes required to move the plot and characters forward. By today's standards the movie may seem tame, 'stagey' and slow but if you sit there with the lights off and the volume turned up and prepare yourself for some old time atmospherics and chills rather than shocks and gore, you're in for a real treat.\", \"This Val Lewton produced film from the mid-1940s isn't fast-paced but it is very effective. Boris Karloff turns in yet another unforgettable performance--this time as the Greek General Pherides who tries to battle a plague and defeat it as he would vanquish any other enemy. But is it really a plague that threatens the lives of all the characters in the film or something more sinister?? Maybe Madame Kyra's vorvolaka? Often surreal in look and atmosphere, this is a wonderful gem of a film filled with creepy and effective little moments.\", \"What makes this one very interesting to me is that it's hard to categorize. In fact most of Lewton's films are (it's a shame he died so young). Even though Lewton was a mere producer he co-wrote this one along with the two other Karloff film. The writing is where these Lewton films excel. This one starts off as a war movie, then moves to what appears as a horror film when they land on the island (an island cemetery - not too hard to imagine for Greece). Then it becomes a psychological mystery followed closely by what seems to be a vampire movie - but then it changes to what appears to be a faith vs science story. Finally, it becomes full fledged horror but surprisingly it's non-fantastical. The movie is firmly based on the real world. It keeps changing gears so that you never know what to expect - some viewers will be put off by this since it doesn't follow the rules of the majority of films. The drama is not overly exciting until we approach the end - everything is very low key, again some viewers may not appreciate this. Karloff gives a good performance - no one else stands out really but the writing is excellent and the actors are propped up by it. Finally, I have to say that some of the scenes in the vault were very creepy even by modern standards - reminded me of some of David Lynch's films.\", \"Not the best of the Val Lewton horror series, but it has its moments. When I think about it, the plot seems very good. A small group of people quarantine themselves on a small Greek island when they discover that one of them has the plague. Boris Karloff stars as a Greek general who becomes cruel when trying to keep order. After the army doctor dies, he becomes superstitious along the lines of an old woman who is also on the island. Somehow, the characters and the situation never come off especially well. It's never bad, but it's never great, either. The finale is quite effective, however. 7/10.\", \"Wonderfully atmospheric film with a unique sense of place and well-drawn characters. Karloff's performance here is excellent, yet very different from his work in other films. You may be disappointed if you go in expecting something like his horror classics for Universal. This one is suggestive rather than shocking, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the subtle horrors of Cat People, The Innocents, or even Rosemary's Baby. Because of its literate script and interesting character development, Isle of the Dead may also appeal to others who don't usually like horror.\", \"When searching and looking up movies on the IMDb I'll often come across movies and think to myself that 'this one should be a little bit higher,' or 'that one should be a little bit lower' -- generally speaking I'm pretty comfortable with the ratings that I see. Every now and then though I find a rating that just absolutely mystifies me. Did the people who voted watch the same movie that I did? The number is an extreme from where I think the film actually belongs. For me, Val Lewton's 'Isle of the Dead' is one of those films. It currently has a rating of 6.4 and when I saw that I was stunned to say the very least.  I first saw this movie on late night BBC (I was living in England at the time) a couple of years ago. It has stayed with me ever since. I love old movies and horror movies are one of the kinds of film that I actively seek out and watch. 'Isle of the Dead' had a lot of competition if it wanted to have any lasting impact with me. It left a great impression and is the reason that years later I've sought out the rest of Val Lewton's work. 'Isle of the Dead' remains my favourite and I truly hope that people will give it another look.  Let me start with the setting. When I originally watched it I thought it was so fresh and original to set a horror film during the Balkan's war in 1912. I can't think of any other films that have done that before or since. You get a very morbid opening scene that reveals a great deal about Karloff's character. He doesn't instruct a sub-ordinate to commit suicide, but he publicly humiliates them and pushes a revolver towards them after making it quite clear that their military career is over. He has an extreme sense of duty, justice and obligation. Fail, in his eyes, and you'll pay a deep price. He's also very protective in his nature -- especially of the men who he commands. He is modern in his approach. Reason and logic are his weapons but superstition and a sense of obligation are his foundation. This is the man who will be trapped and quarantined on an island with a group of travellers and strangers while a plague, or something more sinister, slowly kills each of them off.  The movie is extremely claustrophobic and very well done. They can see the mainland but can't go to it. They are trapped in their own rooms -- alone -- or in the house with the other quarantees. The doctor will try to save them. Science, reason and logic -- the General's core -- will protect them. But when that core begins to fail, he is influenced by superstition, folklore and hysteria ... and acts accordingly. It is a terrific part for Karloff and the General is a great character study. The psychological depth is wonderful. There MUST be a rational explanation for the deaths. They try, and fail, to fight plague-like symptoms by using plague preventative techniques. He is so wedded to finding rational solutions that when confronted with their failure, paradoxically, he decides that the rational solution must be supernatural agents at work.  'Willing Suspension of Disbelief,' seems to be an unfamiliar concept for some of the film's naysayers. The film is unbelievable because people from different countries appear to be able to converse -- without difficulty -- in one language. It is in Greece and the only non-Greek characters are a British diplomat and his wife (may we presume that being a diplomat to Greece, knowledge of how to speak it MIGHT be advantageous?) an American reporter covering the war and a Greek general (since he doesn't have an interpreter, MIGHT he not have some knowledge of the language?), an ex-pat archaeologist who has been there for over a decade (he's probably had NO opportunity to pick up ANY of the language then, eh?) and a travelling student who is eager to return home (that classical education of Greek likely being of no use to him). People don't like the costuming either -- Karloff's wig being such a distraction that it makes the film unenjoyable for them. I really have no way of responding to what seems like an infinitesimally small and nit-picky criticism. The core of the story is whether or not as a horror film and a character study it successfully builds tension and depth from beginning to end. Do consequences of actions have meaning? The tension is high from the opening scene and the stakes only get higher through the film until the final bloody conclusion. The scares are fantastic -- particularly one in the shadows and who comes out of them. There is a tremendous scene with a coffin that is the very height of anxiety, despair and cinematic tension. Is that scene predictable? OF COURSE it is! That's what makes it's eventual occurrence so intense! It is a huge pay-off that is advertised with great skill and execution. This is one of the best films that Mark Robson ever directed and I think he graduated to A-list director largely because of it.  'Isle of the Dead' is under-watched, under-rated, and a gem of cinema intense in it's own beauty. It might be my favourite horror film of the 1940's through 50's.\", \"Plague victims are dropping like flies in this somewhat sluggish, Mark Robson-directed entry in the Val Lewton horror cycle. This one isn't as well-written as the earlier films in the series, and the isolation, while nicely suggested psychologically, fails to cast the spell of hopelessness and despair it ought to. The movie is too genteel to be frightening, and lacks the fine tuning of a director like Jacques Tourneur, who surely would have made more of it. Boris Karloff is quite good in the \\\"lead\\\", however, and the supporting cast is competent if unexciting. By today's standards, there's not much to be scared of here, and though it works up a nice head of steam near the end, it succeeds more as a mood piece than a horror tale.\", \"Scary, fascinating tale set in 1912 Greece. A bunch of people are quarantined on an island (which contains a graveyard) by the plague. A general (Boris Karloff) is in charge, but people dying from the plague, the isolation and close quarters begin to eat away at him. He starts to believe a young, healthy woman among them is a vorvolaka (a vampire). And there's the woman who has an extreme fear of being buried alive...  Quick paced and very literate horror film. There's lots of dialogue about faith, wars, superstition--all of it interesting. The settings are very dark, eerie with a spooky wind always blowing. There are scary moments throughout but they really shift into high gear during the final 15 minutes.  This movie gave me nightmares when I was little! The cast is adequate (except for Jason Robards Sr.--boy, was he annoying!) but Karloff and Katherine Emery were excellent.  Truly frightening old horror film. A definite must-see.\", \"In 1912, a stern old Greek general finds himself trapped on the ISLE OF THE DEAD after an outbreak of the dreaded plague.  When the front office at RKO Pictures informed producer Val Lewton that Boris Karloff had been procured to appear in his next suspense film, he wasn't entirely pleased. Karloff was famous for his portrayal of horrific monsters & mummies, sensationalist creations not at all in tune with the psychological thrillers for which Lewton was noted -- with very low budgets, he was able to fashion fascinating films in which the atmosphere was every bit as important as the plot.  Luckily, Karloff turned out to be an inspired choice. Determined to show that he was a skilled actor (actually, he was a very fine & talented performer) he was completely in sync with what Lewton envisaged, giving a nuanced portrayal of an essentially decent man who finds himself slowly driven to a sort of despair by the forces around him. He becomes the heart of a film which wisely saves its shocks for the last few minutes, having built up to the eerie climax slowly & inexorably.  Lewton was very pleased with Karloff's work and arranged two more collaborations. With only two weeks left in filming ISLE OF THE DEAD, Karloff had to be hospitalized for serious back problems. On his release from hospital, he found Lewton was all prepared to film THE BODY SNATCHER (1945). Karloff gave another wonderful performance, before finally finishing ISLE OF THE DEAD. The following year Karloff starred in Lewton's BEDLAM (1946), completing the trio of very tidy thrillers.  Karloff's co-stars give him good support, especially Ernst Deutsch as a military doctor; Alan Napier & Katherine Emery as a British consul and his invalid wife; Helen Thimig as a superstitious Greek peasant; and little Skelton Knaggs, who in a tiny scene with only a few words is able to make his Cockney tinker character come alive.  Ellen Drew & Marc Cramer handle the romance, which fortunately does not intrude too much on the story.  The viewer, in the course of watching ISLE OF THE DEAD, will discover much about the medical state of catatonia, as well as the monstrous vorvolaka, part vampire - part werewolf, which haunts Greek nightmares.   Lewton based his ideas for this film on a painting he had seen as a boy in Russia, Arnold B\\u00f6cklin's darkly allegorical Island of the Dead (1880), which is shown behind the opening credits of the film. This somewhat sinister painting was also the inspiration for Sergey Rachmaninoff's celebrated symphonic poem, \\u0091The Isle of the Dead' (1909).  Incidentally, the conflict which is the background to the film was the Balkan War of 1912, in which the Balkan League (Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria & Montenegro) attacked the Ottoman Empire and destroyed most of its hegemony on the European continent. Begun in October and ended in December, it was short & bloody. However, troubles in Constantinople started hostilities up again in January of 1913. It finally ended in May, with the Turks once more decisively defeated. Although the Empire was left very much weakened, the War solved very little else. In June, the victorious parties began fighting amongst themselves, with Greece & Serbia trouncing Bulgaria by August. Greece ended the two short Wars with Crete and parts of Macedonia & Epirus added to her territories and the new state of Albania was carved out of old Ottoman lands. But ancient animosities were aroused and the entire Peninsula lay waiting for the next international incident, which obligingly took place 10 months later at the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"It's a Wonderful Life\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0038650\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Jaws 2\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0077766\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Jaws 3-D\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0085750\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"  Garbage.The word fits this film to a tee.Jaws was the cinematic masterpiece.Then you look at this film.I watched it often as a teenager.Same goes for all the Jaws movies.I see the trouble with all the sequels in this genre and hollyland.YOU CAN NEVER REPLICATE THE ORGINAL FEARS,SUCCESS,AWARDS.Jaws3 misses the boat for these reasons:No plot,no action,no directions.Jaws3 and Jaws4 are two films they should never have made period.I am of the firm opinion Jaws and Jaws2 are the only Jaws films every made.Hollyworld less is sometimes MORE.  -33 out of 10.\", \"I gave this movie a 2 rating and that is only because of the abortion that followed it deserves a lower mark. The shark looked fake, the actors looked embalmed...even Sea World looked stupid. I remember when this movie came out and my parents took me to Sea World because they had all the props out used in the movie...I was embarrassed to even be in a picture with that stupid looking shark. I saw it in the theater with my sister when it came out and the only thing that was worth the money was the 3-D effects...this crap was on TV and I feel the need to vent because it's 2 hours of my life that are gone forever. I'm waiting for Crow and the MST 3000 gang to light into this...\", \"3-D in 1983 was a big concept and another money making gimmick but it just doesn't stand the test of time. With todays studios turning out computer animated effects and creatures, this movie is just plain cheesey by millenium standards. Mostly it's just one of those movies you would watch on cable when reruns are in season-and the reruns suck would you watch it.\", \"The shark looked totally fake, especially right before it crashed into the glass window under water. The film, characters, and dialogue were boring and uninteresting. But no matter how bad it got, I still liked the Under Water kindom idea and when the shark was swimming around it and scaring all the people. A particularly funny(that's right funny) part was when the shark trapped a group of people and they were all moaning and crying. Jaws was good. Jaws 2 was somewhere between horrible, painful movie and OK movie, but closer to horrible, painful movie, this was OK, as for Jaws 4 let's not even go there.\", \"Part of the appeal of 3-D is that can lift a relatively boring movie to more than it should be. That is the case in Jaws #3. Having pretty much gotten all they could from the creature from the deep franchise the producers were left with no other choice than to attach a gimmick to this movie to draw an audience.    All I can remember about seeing Jaws 3-D in the theaters was that I had a lot fun. Being young I didn't care much for plot or characters. All that mattered was that I was entertained and I was. I just saw the movie recently on tape and it was all I could do to stay awake. It was just a ripoff of the original and all it's clones. If the tape had been in 3-D I might have been more alert.    The only good thing that I can say for the film is that if you can't go to Sea World you can at least get an idea of what it is like from this movie.\", \"Here is where the Jaws franchise takes a downward plunge. The story in this one is that Dennis Quaid plays the now adult son of Roy Scheider, whom played the police chief in the first two films. Quaid takes a job working at Sea World in Orlando, and begins to strike up a romance with Bess Armstrong, a dolphin trainer and biologist at the water park. A maintenance worker gets mangled and killed in a late night attack by a baby great white. When the young shark is discovered, it is captured with plans to exploit it for more tourist dollars. Then the baby dies. And momma gets ticked. Very ticked. When Momma shows up, I have to say that the deaths are done well. Especially the poor guy whom gets chewed up, and we see (and hear) the carnage from WITHIN momma shark's mouth.  The rest of the movie follows Quaid, Armstrong, and a few other noteworthy thespians such as Lou Gosset Jr., and Lea Thompson, as they try to outwit the momma shark's vengeful streak.   This movie was released in the middle of the 3-D revival of 1983, and several scenes are effective (the floating arm comes to mind), but many are just window dressing (the submersibles), or just painfully goofy (the shark approaches the camera head on, but DOES NOT swish it's tail back and forth as it swims. The shark looks like a plastic toy moving on a track!)  Just forget the earlier two films, and just turn your brain on auto-pilot, and you'll enjoy this film just fine.   I just have one question, to anybody whom may know... When I first saw the film in the mid 80's on BETAMAX (!!!), the title logo of \\\"JAWS III\\\" was animated in a cool red and yellow 1950's scifi lettering style, and they \\\"chomped\\\" at the viewer to the accompaniment of a rocket-like swooshing sound and a loud CHOMP!!!   Viewing a videocassette made in the mid 90's, the swooshing sound is there, the CHOMP sound effect is there, but the cool 3-D animated logo is gone. It is replaced by a still frame of \\\"Jaws III\\\".   That opening gripped me when I was a kid... where did it go?        \", \"Jaws 3-D is a trashy second sequel to Jaws that's more likely to turn viewers' stomachs over rather than keep them on the edge of their seat.   The premise sees biologists Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong capturing a great white shark to hold at Florida's Seaworld. However, the manager (Louis Gosset Jr.) makes a careless decision and the shark dies. Within hours, the shark's mammoth-sized mother has arrived on the scene for bloodthristy revenge.   Dan, on the previous page, clearly stated the mystery of Carl Gottleib, co-writer of Jaws and Jaws II, coming up with this idea. Actually, it probably seemed a good idea at the time which explains the presence of such established stars like Quaid and Gosset Jr. But, it turned out to be a thumbs-down. The film is daft and unexciting and relies more on blood and guts coming out of the screen than on suspense. The shark is bigger but no match for the two that took residence at Amity, it looks fake, roars and swims (or rather crawls) at a snails-pace and misses out on most of its potential-victims due to its clumsiness. But, of course, its just a model and so the direction is really to blame.   Fortuanately, its quite fast-paced so watching it doesn't really do any harm. Its just a big shame that Joe Alves has taken things so far off the rails.\", \"DUM,DUM,DUM,DUM.....Just when you thought you were safe from sequels... Comes this second dreadful,horrid,and poorly acted film.Louis Gosset Jr. sports a terrible ghetto accent thoughout the film,probably hoping he won't be recongnized.James Bond Hopeful(at the time)Simon McQuade plays a Costeuo-like Documentary filmaker,Mr.Fritz-Royce who*spoilers ahead* gets swallowed whole by Mrs. Bruce.Bess Armstrong(High Road to China) plays the love interest,but hey, at least she's better than Karen Young in Jaws the Revenge.Dennis Quaid(The Parent Trap,The Right Stuff,Dreamscape) is the now grown up Mike Brody,who with Martin Brody out of the film,is the hero.John Putch is Shawn still afraid of the Deep Blue Sea(get it?)In case your wondering the *cough* \\\"plot\\\" is set at SEA WORLD FLORIDA,not AMITY ISLAND,like in first two and \\\"the revenge\\\". A major plot point from the british sci-fi classic \\\"Gorgo\\\" is reused. What this film needs the most is to be released in Widescreen at it's 2:35.1 aspect ratio(plus with the 3-D process)on DVD. Hopefully if the Jaws 2 Special Collecter's Edition released this coming summer is a success,we might just see that,until then,avoid the atrocias video and Television Versions,Catch this fish at your nearest revival theater and enjoy some cheap thrills in 3-D.\", \"OK... First of all the Jaws series doesnt need a plot. Who said all movies are supposed to make you think. I love all the Jaws movies. Given, the special effects in Jaws three were poorly done, thats the beauty of it all. Its an old movie. Just enjoy it!!! It has more of a plot and storyline than Jwas 2 did. And do you really want to question a killer shark. That was the only movie I had to close my eyes during, IT had more to do with my great fear of sharks and anything resembling them, but still. I thought the part where you are looking from inside his mouth was Exqusite. How many other older horror movies were good to you peoples standards??? (Directed at DAN GRANT and other people who hate this movie, for other reasons than not liking sharks) Why wouldnt Carl Gottleib want his name on this movie?!?! I would die to have made a jaws movie. Well maybe I will make JAWS 5... I mean how can there be like tons of the other horror movies and this one be bad. Can anyone really tell the difference between all the Screams and I know what you did last summer??? I dont think so. Well I better wrap this up i dont know how many words I have and I dont want to break 250... but might have so bye...\", \"Why follow a bad sequel with another even worse one ? GREED!! 3d was lame .. Only relation to JAWS are Chief Brodys sons. Mike now works at Seaworld and Sean shows up to visit his brother. No references to Amity or their mother or father . No originals appear in this movie which is a blessing . And once again as in Jaws 2 is continuity problem , Mike and Sean are considerably older than what they should be . This movie is supposed to take place 8 years after Jaws . That means they should be 13 and 18 . Instead actors Dennis Quaid and John Putch are in their twenties . Oh well , lousy movie anyway.\", \"You know, they should make a DVD boxset consisting of Jaws 2, Jaws 4 and - Jesus - this crap that is Jaws 3. Why? Well, in simple terms it could be used as an extreme torture device, DVD quality making the pain even worse. I won't say anything about the plot (even though there is not one) but I will say something about the dazzling, state-of-the-art special effects, the only thing that salvages the movie. Basically there is some underwater sea life park and some folks go down to check it out in a little orange diving machine. Unbelievable! You wouldn't think for one minute that they were using a miniature centre made from yogurt pots, or a diving machine so super-imposed one side of it totally disappears in one scene! Nah, great SFX. They could even be compared to the might of the Doctor Who films made in the sixties, with flying saucers on strings etc. Oh sorry, I forgot - they weren't actually made from yogurt pots.  You can probably figure out that I dislike this movie a lot, and you'd be right. But please, take note from this review - when Carl Gottleib put pen to toilet paper we thought we'd have on OK movie. It turns out that looking at a dog turd for 90 minutes would give you more adrenaline rushes than this total tosh.\", \"What can I say? It has horrible acting, beyond amateurish dialogue, sub-par special effects and you know what.....I've seen it about 50 times! It is so campy and awful that it is good! I definitely think this ranks right up there with Showgirls as one of the all time so bad its good movies! Special mention goes to Dennis Quaid, one of my favorite actors, for looking like he's in on the joke!\", \"I don't know why this movie got so much criticism. I thought it was pretty good. Sure, the effects might not have been the best, but it was still a great movie. The original Jaws was one of, if not THE, greatest movies of all time. That's a tough act to follow any way you look at it. Jaws 3 also had some great actors, including Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong. You can say what you want, but I'll always love Jaws 3.\", \"Jaws 3 is certainly an improvement from Jaws 2 and ranks behind the original Jaws as the series best. This third installment finds a great white shark who wreaks havoc at a aquatic Florida amusement park. This Jaws features some great scenes that are very thrilling and chilling the music is great and the setting of this Jaws film is what makes it so good. The acting is at the very top of the scale with Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong let me also mention Lea Thompson all three at this time were very young making this work their earliest roles. As always Louis Gossett Jr. is great. Jaws 3 runs enough on cable at just anytime during the years and try the video store and add this great sequel to your video library collection.\", \"For all those people that did not like Jaws 2, this third installment makes the second look as good as the original! Not worth writing about!!! STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!!!  Grade: F  \", \"I can't understand why people attack this movie. The acting was fine. The SFX and directing are obviously not going to be as great as the original because there is no Spielburg. The shark in my opinion looked good enough. Too many people watched this movie expecting it to by like Jaws (1975). If you lower your standards, this movie is very entertaining. 3 out of 5 stars.\", \"A Nice Addition to One of the Best Series of Horror Films. The Problem is that it Takes Place off the Classic Island, but Just Deal with it. It is Most Certainly not the Best of the Series, As a Matter of Fact, Think it is the Worst one. But, It still is a Good Movie and Certainly worth seeing. 8 1/2 out of 10.\", \"I love the first Jaws-film. That is probably the best film ever done and this is the second sequel and I like it, some of the effects it`s very bad but the film is pretty entertainment. The acting is pretty good and the sharks looks great. This time is the biggest shark ever, a real monster. I hope I will see this film with 3D-effects sometime.  Rating: 6\", \"I give this one 2 points for its narrative attempt at trying to make it \\\"real,\\\" and one point for the filmmakers' truly laudable 'Efforts.'  Four generations of special-effects technology have already passed since J3 was made (maybe more... it was first released in theaters almost twenty-years ago), and the viewer simply can't get over its bad chroma-key mini-sub, cheesy 3-D props, et al.  However, like most badly executed thrillers with substandard \\\"eye-candy,\\\" J3 has a worthy message for all of us: Try to bottle Nature in an attractive Theme Park package, and nature will get back at you in a deadly, often gruesome way.  Most interesting here are the two-dimensional, stock characters. They surprise us in how they eventually evolve as the story comes to its inevitable conclusions...  What we may initially perceive as the secondary Villain (the manager of this aquatic theme park, \\\"Calvin\\\"), turns out to be just an ordinary person at a loss for words, and tries his best to save the endangered tourists trapped underwater. Unlike the previous two films (in which we're subjected to the pig-headed-ness of one dollar-hungry Mayor), Calvin made me laugh when I realized his character was just all attitude and 'talk.' He is speechless when everybody realizes they have a serious situation on their hands: 35 feet of man-eating death!  The heroes (God save what's left of their present acting careers!) also prove brave and honorable.  My favorite character, however, was the calm and rational female tour guide that succeeded in 'tranquilizing' the trapped visitors until rescue divers could successfully bail them out. Here you have this short lady telling the much taller adults and children to conserve their energy and air, so that escape seems all the more possible.  Brief Review: J2 was pretty much along the same lines as its original... except here we have a regatta of mostly teens and twenty-somethings trying to stay afloat, and the shark in question keeps getting bigger by the time we reach J4.  J4 stinks and sinks! Pray that someday we'll all be allowed to go back to our beaches without the likes of Michael Caine and Lorraine Gary polluting our oceans. These landlubbers belong either on the Broadway stage or beside their mogul husbands, sitting quietly counting their box-office money.  See Jaws 3. If anything, it's great watching this truly unique aquatic show, where 'red popcorn' goes flying off into the audience.  \", \"An underwater sea park is attacked by a great white with a bite radius of nearly a yard. When it attacks a underwater tunnel, with many civilians trapped inside, it's up to Dennis Quaid and crew to weld a plate in place of the breach . Simon MacCorkindale portrays a Brit photographer who likes the media spotlight, but courageously offers to be \\\"live bait\\\"(..and is in the film's best sequence as the shark chows down on him with the camera recording this inside the mouth, really a remarkable effect)as a distraction for Quaid to complete the welding task without harm. Bess Armstrong is Quaid's lady love who decides to go down and watch his back just in case the shark swims toward them. Louis Gossett Jr. is the head honcho of the theme park who watches in horror as his dream goes up in smoke thanks to the shark's desire to feed.  The 3D effects just aren't very good..they might've worked in 1983 on the big screen, but just make the viewing experience now a burden. The 3D effects look like just that..separate from everything else. What hurts even more is that nothing really happens for nearly 1 hour and a half until the shark makes it's attack on people in the water(mainly Lea Thompson, the love interest of Dennis Quaid's brother John Putch). The shark effects range from good to awful..especially rotten is the scene where the shark breaks through the glass housing the control room with Gossett Jr and company. The cast, except Bess, are merely going through the motions and it's quite easy to see that the franchise was about finished off..JAWS:THE REVENGE would be the death nail on the coffin of the Jaws franchise.\", \"The sexy shark swam on by, catching me by the eye. A rose for it I had to buy. . . f*ck it. This movie is the dumbest, foulest, arse sponge that ever floated to the top of my urinal. It made me jump once, but with one swift bowel movement it sunk again where it belongs, at the bottom of the sea.  P.S. Australian on a boat SHOULD be drinking. if on boats at all. . .infact forget the boat.  Also, \\\"Open the hatch.\\\" is a guaranteed pick up line.  This movie isn't worth ten lines.  It isn't worth five. *padding out to ten lines COMPLETE*\", \"This may very well be the worst movie ever made with the possible exception of Man's Best Friend. The story is idiotic, the acting is unbelievably bad and the special effects look like a 7 year-old made them on a PC. For example, at one point the shark, which looks like a cardboard cut-out (and probably is!), smashes the plate glass to the viewing area as Sea World and then, as the water rushes through the broken panel, the shark just sits there! All in all, a hilarious movie. I wouldn't have believed that it was possible for anyone to make such a bad movie in this day and age. What amazes me is why Dennis Quaid consented to be in this travesty since he is not that bad of an actor. But I guess to be consistent with the rest of the film, he acted horribly himself. What were they thinking when they made this movie? That is the mystery.\", \"I have to say, you know, it has been my \\\"sequel weekend\\\". Despite repeated warnings from my family and IMDb users to skip this \\\"Jaws\\\" flick, if you even want to really call it that, but I ignored it and figured maybe it's just getting a bad rep because it would be compared to the first and ultimate classic \\\"Jaws\\\". In the words of Nancy Karogan \\\"Oh, why?! Why?!\\\". That was the only way I could describe the film and sitting throw it.  Wither it was the cheesy cheesy cheesy effects, I mean did every horror movie in the 80's have to be 3-D? It's rather, well, cheesy! The plot? Was there a plot I even ask? There was no main story or line for us to follow and I felt the story kept on forgetting to telling us the sub-plot. The acting was horrible, I'm surprised Dennis could even get a career after this. I'm just telling you, please do not be as stupid as me and ignore the warnings! Be afraid! Be very afraid! Of the actual movie that is.  1/10\", \"I haven't seen Jaws 3 in about seven years. Its one of those movies whether sequel or original film dates very quickly. the last time i saw the movie i noticed how bad the print looked (mind you it was a twenty year old VHS copy i viewed) and how i could not care less for what happened to any of the characters.  The Great White Shark when it finally appears (this time its around thirty feet long) is laugh out loud fake and cheap.   Chunks of rubber is a better description for the whole movie.  Awful.  Bloody Awful.\", \"Abysmal. Shockingly awful. Bottom of the barrel. Things can't get any worse than this stink-bomb. I still suffer severe depression when I think about this abomination. 3D!!! They announced. Well it didn't work. The only teeth coming at me in the cinema were the ones that a boy in the third row had stolen from his grandfather and thrown. The fish's head floating, pointlessly, at the start reminded me to buy some haddock on the way home from the cinema. The acting was so wooden that a carpenter in the audience got his tools out. I could feel the audience slipping away into some mass coma. It was heartbreaking. I remember my friend glancing at me, his eyes lifeless and sad. Special Jaws 3 counselling groups were set up in my local area and I attended regularly.This crime against cinema should be battered and fried. Absolutely disgraceful.\", \"This film is about a man who is afraid of sharks. He decides to work in a marina so he can put himself in as much danger as possible with other marine life.  One day, a gigantic rubber shark decides to enter the park to see the sights and stuff. Brody Junior realises this and spends the rest of the movie in the water.  Anyway, after all the nerve biting tension and thrills, the shark is destroyed and they all live happily ever after in 3D.  It's strange how a film can claim to have three dimensions when every character in it only has one...  This trashy, thrown together mess is an embarrassment to the series. How far we have come from great dialogue, great performances and iconic thrills to this piece of nondescript tosh.  Then again, it was directed by Alan Smithee's uncles cousins brother in law, twice removed. So the results were inevitable.\", \"As an ardent \\\"scholar\\\" of B-movies, I found particular delight when happening upon this little piece. Unintentional humor being the requisite hallmark of any \\\"good\\\" B-movie, this film has plenty of it. Dialogue and acting that borders on the truly comedic, ill-defined meandering characters, loads of unexplained shots, scenes, and material-this is not the \\\"best\\\" B-movie I have seen, but it is entertaining nonetheless. The effects are perhaps the most overtly amateurish aspect of the film, and sure to get the biggest laughs (especially the end). But a discerning viewer will find more humor in the dialogue and acting (read: Gosset Jr.), vague characters (read: the British/Australian/Whatever shark killers/photographers), and terribly edited action. So, for B-movie fans, I give this a 3 out of 5.\", \"Jaws 3-D (1983) was not only a sequel to the first two JAWS films, but it was also one of the few movies that took advantage of the rebirth of the 3-D fad that was sweeping Hollywood during the early 80's (see Amityville 3-D and Friday the 13th 3-D). When the film hit the video shelves, they scrapped the whole thing. Why make a 3-D movie in the first place if you're not going to take advantage of it when it's available for the home video market? The video looked bad when it was released as a rental. Many of the scenes that were shot didn't make any sense or were badly projected. The movie did poorly at the box office and after a couple of years, no more mainstream films were presented in 3-D. The movie itself is pretty bad. Only for die hard fans of the JAWS series.  Not recommended, unless they re-release it in 3-D. other than that it's pretty much worthless.\", \"By far, this is the most innovative of the whole series! I mean, come on! SEA WORLD! Terror at Sea World! You don't get any better than this, and I must say, the acting, the score, and the development, all written with intellect! I do not care what any one says, this film is a true piece of work. With the same type of opening, of a P.O.V. shot in the deep blue ocean, which was missed in Jaws 2, this one has a creepy feeling from the beginning. Admittingly, the first two films preceeding this have it beat in many areas, but not all! The very idea of not one, but TWO sharks in Sea World as its grand opening takes place...is just freaky! Special effects will suffer when viewed with out 3-D glasses, however, the film is still enjoyable to watch. Alan Parker povides the film with a new kind of shrieking score that makes the feel a little eerie as the original shark theme is put to the test, and brought to a new level of scary. What most call boring, is the intellectual discussions that the main characters speak of as they, being adults, must deal with the water crises in the most mature way they can. Different ideas of murder, explosions, and captivity are all the order of the evening as the exposition is revealed. Later, the film takes a plunge when hungry mamma is let out, and all hell breaks loose, literally. Not so much the scares, as the shocks, are what draws me to this film, and every minute is worth while. Never trust the ocean, it is always full of suprises, and in all the wrong ways. Yes, the 3rd demension is pure terror, and Jaws 3-D will not fail to serve audiences with a real bang and boom! 9/10\", \"and left the series where it was. This was made in the eighty's a few years after the second one (not as good as the first, but pretty good), the first two were made in the seventy's and the sound effects and shark effects were worse in this. The shark made in this looks like a piece of cardboard that floats through the water, they copied the original score from the first jaws film and if it wasn't for a brody descendant and the score this could've been named something else. It looked so damn fake when the shark went through the glass at the end of this ridiculously bad film. Even Dennis quaid did a bad job in this one, if they kept Roy Schneider it would be worth watching. I only gave this a two because it was suspenseful at parts. A part that bugs me is when they say they are going to bait the shark near the end they are saying they will use a live person as bait, but at the end nobody is used and all the shark does is swim at them and through a glass window and tries eating a bunch of people. I'm tired of great movies being ruined by bad sequels. Jaws 4: the revenge was worse though, its pretty far fetched how a shark would know the brody family and would be stalking them in the Caribbean (jaws 4 plot). Don't see this or part 4 because they both suck.

I was rolling my eyes and smirking almost nonstop. If this wasn't one of the first talking pictures and didn't have Jolson in it, it would have disappeared long ago. Also this (technically)isn't an all talking picture. It has sequences of dialogue and signing from Jolson but it's mostly a silent with title cards and everything.  Cornball story aside the acting didn't impress me. I'm no fan of Jolson. I do admit his acting wasn't too bad but I hated his songs and didn't think he was much of a singer. When the sound came on when he was signing I kept hoping it could switch back to silent! Also he does two numbers in black face. I realize that was considered OK back in 1927 but it comes across as appalling and racist today. The rest of the actors overact to a startling degree--but that was how silent film stars DID act so I can't fault them.  A real bad film but I give it a 2 because it is historically important. Anyone who interested in cinema should see it at least once.\", \"1st watched 8/20/2005 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Crosland, Alan): Sappy introduction to sound from Warner Brothers and Al Jolson. The movie made a lot of money for the studio and gave people the first opportunity to see what sound could be like in the movies. There was actually only one talking scene with sound but also a few musical performances by Jolson and Cantor Josef Rosenblatt. These scenes in itself were monumental to film and the movie has a part in the world of cinema because of this. As for the movie, it's very heavy-laden with sappiness and schmaltz as the son of the Cantor has to decide between singing for the church or taking his show on the road to Broadway. It takes a long long time for him to make a decision and the viewers can't help but yell back at the screen, \\\"Come on just make up your mind one way or the other, PLEASE!!.\\\" The religious family lays on the guilt as his father becomes ill, and the girlfriend and Broadway show director lay their side of the argument on heavy as well. As an entertainment piece, it's nice to see Jolson especially doing his classic \\\"Mamy\\\" near the end but the entire movie would have been better as a video collection. Oops, I guess we'd have to wait another half a decade or so for that and by then both of the singers from this movie were long gone, too bad it would have at least been interesting..

The novelty of being the first sound film having worn off, this movie truly doesn't have much to offer. Al Jolson stars as Jack Robin, the son of a Jewish Cantor, who leaves home to become a Broadway entertainer. This storyline was not much more than an excuse to fill the picture with musical numbers, and even most of those seem bland by today's standards. There are a few good moments, thanks for the most part to Jolson's performance. In one touching scene, Robin serenades his mother with the song \\\"Blue Skies.\\\" This scene contains the only real dialogue in the movie, which just makes the rest of the film seem that much more flat. Jolson definitely has the charm and acting chops of a leading man. He could carry a film if it was worth carrying. Unfortunately, this one wasn't.\", \"What can say this German Count about this film?... what can a German aristocrat say who deeply loves ( besides his fat German heiresses ) the silent cinema?

But then no one would need to see the film. In this sequel, a rag-tag group pays a visit to the island of dinosaurs to rescue the teenage victim of a hang-gliding accident.  ACCESS HOLLYWOOD reports JP3 began filming without a completed script. That explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to demonstrate state-of-the-art special effects. Sure, there are a few clever scenes and some moderately funny bits, but no meaningful plot line to tie them together. The dinosaur puppets and animation in JP3 are very good to excellent, and more numerous than ever. But the overall film experience can not hold a candle to the original JURASSIC PARK or even JP2.  JP3 is a mercifully short 90 minutes -- the last 10 minutes of which is credits. Even at that, I found myself frequently checking my wristwatch. The audience I saw it with left the theater in silence.  A better bet: see the movie LEGALLY BLONDE.  Dave\", \"JP3 lacks the Spielberg touch. It's an all-out assault on the senses featuring \\\"in your face\\\" dinosaurs. Watching this film was a bit like a roller coaster ride from hell.   The script is lame; it simultaneously asks and then leaves too many questions unanswered. Also, we don't really get to appreciate the humans in the film for all they're worth. For example, William H. Macy is too great a talent to have to compete with dino-thugs for our attention. And Laura Dern was especially sympathetic in JP1; in this film, she's barely a blip on the radar screen.  The whole JP3 experience was t o o m u c h. Too much noise, too many surprises, too many characters dying off, too much predictable, gratuitous violence.   Word to the wise: vote yourself off this island.  (I rated it a 3 for special effects; I took off the other 7 points for having absolutely no originality.)\", \"Did people expect \\\"Jurassic Park 3\\\" to be full of surprises? Not one moment of it is worth it. Many elements could easily scare people out of the movies...and it's not the dinos! Tea Leoni...I think she's a great actress, but I'm sorry to say that this time she reached the bottom line. I wonder if she happened to strain a vocal chord while shooting the movie....Laura Dern...she's ok, but why not be more noticeable in the movie, maybe exchange smart dialogs with Sam Neil. Alessandro Nivola - \\\"have you ever heard of something called facial expression? Fellings, emotions...\\\"..he's got to work harder on that! Sam Neil, no big deal. The soundtrack...got to change that record, or you get tired of it. My applause goes to William H. Macy, a talented actor who I've never seen playing a bad role....unfortunately he can't save the movie, nor can the well computer-created dinosaurs.\", \"This movie was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life. From the opening 10 minutes, I was ready to leave. The cliches there slapping you in the face, and the plot was not only predictably stupid, but full of more holes than swiss cheese. I am considering suing for that lost 2 hours, and $6.25 along with the fact that I am now stupider for watching this waste of film. The T-Rex's must be flipping in their graves, so to speak.\", \"How sad it is when a film as wonderful as \\\"Jurassic Park\\\" slowly nosedives into hackneyed and mediocre territory throughout its franchise. The newest sequel, Jurassic Park III, has given no thought to characters, a story, or pretty much a script, and instead relies on non-stop dinosaur action, which is neither thrilling nor very interesting to watch. The dinosaurs seemed to look incredibly fake compared to the 1993 technology, after 7 years of CGI advancements, it only gives you more of the feeling that the film was pumped out for the summer relying only on its name. The introduction of a pterodactyl does not a great movie make.  Go see \\\"Shrek\\\" again.  \", \"Number 1 was really great summer popcorn fun. It was the modern Jaws.  Number 2 is best summed up by Jeff Goldblum in the movie about being the stupidest idea in the history of stupid ideas (or something like that).  Number 3 is the obituary notice...JP has achieved all it ever will.   Once they realized they had no fresh ideas they should have just let sleeping dinos lie.  That said. Movie is ok if you don't mind knowing you already have seen it before.  \", \"I had been looking forward to this movie since Lost World came out. It didn't bother me that Lost World wasn't as intellectual as the original, and here, I was just hoping for a good monster movie. It was all about \\\"Dinosaurs eat people.\\\" However, it was disappointing even on that level.  For starters, there were not enough people to eat, and while I'll keep it a secret how many people get eaten, it was not enough. Also, while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community, there were not nearly \\\"enough\\\" dinosaurs. And many dinosaurs, like the spikey-back-and-has-a-club-on-its-tail-osaurus, just made cameos and didn't do much considering how cool they are.  (START SPOILERS) Then there were the Pterodactyls. The figures I've read put their body weight at about 15 pounds, while the movie made them look closer to 300. Worse, they didn't get to eat anybody, or even splatter them on the rocks by dropping them from high up. There was no ending to the movie, either, it was just, all of the sudden, credits. (END SPOILERS) I'm left wondering if the edition I saw was missing 40 minutes of film.  My only conclusion can be that they taught the Pterodactyls to stick their long beaks stealthily into your pockets and get your $7. Go rent the Carnosaur series; at least you won't be disappointed.\", \"To summarize, my group of friends and I spent about 45 minutes outside the theater sharing our favorites gaffes, plot inconsistencies, untied loose ends, and other ridiculous aspects of this movie. I found the story trite to the point of inconsequential and the plot lines as underdeveloped as the dino embryos still locked in the shaving cream canister from Jurassic Park 1. The editing was poor and none of the characters engendered any sort of sympathy or feeling. In short, this movie lacked any of the suspense and thrill that the first movie provided from a story standpoint  Even the new dinosaurs were few and far between (although I really enjoyed the pterodactyls.) We got several brief shots of the new species and only 2 really were involved in the action.  As a scientist and former childhood paleontologist, the lack of any real scientific content (not that it had to be realistic, but logically formed i.e. how they built the dinos in #1 and malcom's chaos ramblings) was disappointing as well.  In short, the movie seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to trot dinos back on the scene to make some money. I hope that movie-goers don't fall for this trap again (although I did apparently)\", \"(A possible minor spoiler) The first \\\"Jurassic Park\\\" was an effective, but silly film that did it's job and was actually pretty good. The sequel \\\"The Lost World\\\" had a few decent moments, but those were ruined by the lame end portion of the film which had a T-Rex running amok in San Diego. Now in \\\"Jurassic Park III,\\\" what little story there was in the first one and the sequel, has been thrown out the window and replaced by a mere 90 minutes of basically non-stop action, which would have worked had the film not been so poorly done.  Sam Neill is back as Dr. Grant, who is given a proposition by a couple (William H. Macy & Tea Leoni) to come with them to an island to help them find their son, who's been lost for over 2 months. But of course this island just happens to be populated by dinosaurs and of course the plane the are on just happens to crash leaving them stranded with a bunch of dinos after them.  This one was obviously intended as a thrill ride, with no real story whatsoever, but even on that level the movie doesn't deliver. Director Joe Johnston (\\\"Jumanji\\\") somehow managed to take what little magic was left in the \\\"Jurassic\\\" movies and squeeze the life right out of it.   The dinos look okay, though by now they're just standard fair and not very scary. The bottom line is it's not a very good film, even as a thrill ride. * out of 4 stars.\", \"It's clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters. But immediately the story line causes you to dislike the new main characters. The fly-over of the island and dinosaurs below lacked any impact at all and almost looked like a cartoon. The all action entrance to the island is merely a rehash of parts from JP 1 and 2. The story-line is predictable to the point of annoyance and it's entirely unsatisfying end left me feeling cheated. This gave me with no option but to award the film 3/10!\", \"This would probably be a good film to see....provided you've already seen every other film in existence, and thoroughly explored the bellybuttons of yourself and those around you. God, this movie was unbelievably insipid, with some of the worst (or is it nonexistent) writing ever captured on film. There is no saving grace to this film; even the animatronics are kind of lame, and it's just a complete waste of time and money.  Run. Fast. It's beyond horrible.  \", \"You could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie. The first one had an original story, the second stole one from King Kong, and in the end (I hope) of this trilogy the story seemed to have been bypassed altogether. Drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives. That was about all there was to it. The special effects were decent but not worth 8 dollars. If you have a discount theatre in your local area, wait and see it for a buck. I wouldn't even bother renting it. That would be too much money for this unthrilling thriller.\", \"When i went to see this i thought, i liked the first two and thought that they were very suspenseful so this one should be good also.

I remember when i went to see JP as a kid it was my favorite movie and franchise, the acting, the SFX the Music, the direction! all fantastic, JP2 in my opinion was OK pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments (like the gymnast girl kicking a raptor..please!) but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experience.  But the the third one has no point!! It's supposed to be a sequel that Carry's on from JP2 and yet it magically includes brand new things to the franchise that would have been impossible to miss on the previous 2 films! for example: 1) The \\\"new\\\" mega Spinosaurus - Seriously, what the hell!! This thing follows them everywhere they go, they cannot escape it's presence and yet in The lost world (the same island) do you see it once? do you hear it? does anyone even MENTION it? NO!

But then Joanna returns and intends to get her son back, which leads to a cruel custody trial.  Kramer vs. Kramer is a superbly well written and magnificently acted human drama that will only leave the most cold-hearted a viewer untouched. Hoffman's growing relationship with his son is so well portrayed and the film never takes an easy way out. It always feels very real and thanks to the film's low-key approach it makes even more of an impact and can easily work upon multiple viewings, the film's dramatic impact does not lessen.  Easily recommended; 10 out of 10.\", \"What can I say about Kramer vs. Kramer? On the surface it's rather simple but underneath it deals with emotions greater than life itself. It delivers many fantastic moments, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry. You sympathize with the characters and you care about them. Many films fail at this, Kramer vs. Kramer is a success.  I think everyone would agree the acting is superb. Once you watch Kramer vs. Kramer, for some time the acting in most other films starts to feel plastic and unemotional. The actors seem to get along well with their roles and the characters really live on the screen. There's some beautiful chemistry between them. I think the best performance in the film comes from the young Justin Henry. He's different from any other child actor I've ever seen. He's amazingly natural.  Also, there's some kind of neurotic beauty in Meryl Streep. And Dustin Hoffman delivers one of the best performances of his career! The story is very well written. It's simple but complicated at the same time. The concept is the simple part, the feelings associated is the complicated part of it.  If you haven't seen this film yet, you're definitely missing out! See it now!\", \"Inexplicably, I watched this movie for the very first time just a couple of days ago, and understood from the very beginning what all the fuss is about. This movie held my attention from beginning to end, and ran me through the whole range of emotions (and might have helped me discover a few I never knew about.)  Dustin Hoffman absolutely shines as Ted Kramer. He is absolutely convincing as a man having to juggle at least three different challenges in life: jilted husband, workaholic ad executive and loving father. Meryl Streep as Joanna Kramer was less central to the movie simply because Joanna was absent for a good part of it, but when she was on screen she gave Hoffman a run for his money. The true standout, though, (in my opinion) had to be young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer. Children are always the innocent victim in a marital breakdown, and Justin seemed absolutely natural and completely believable in this role as he deals with the conflicting emotions around his mother and his adjustment to life with Dad, only then to have the confusion around why he should have to leave his Dad when it was his Mom who walked out on him. Young Justin didn't seem to miss a beat in this very difficult role.  All in all, this is an excellent, Oscar-worthy movie whose only weak point was what I thought to be a truly disappointing decision to go for the sappy and happy ending, which was totally unrealistic considering the destructive custody battle Ted and Joanna had gone through. But there's not much else to complain about here.  9/10\", \"The Academy Award winning 'Kramer vs. Kramer' follows a snazzy businessman Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) and his divorce with his bored wife (Meryl Streep). One day Ted's wife leaves him and their child in search for a better life, forcing Ted to become closer to his son (Justin Henry). The two bond and become very close (but only after some friction), and just as everything is going perfect Ted's wife comes back to town and wants sole custody of their son. Ted then goes on a mission not to let his son get taken away from him, and fights his wife in court. Dustin Hoffman gives a tremendous performance along with Meryl Streep, and young Justin Henry is impressive. It's a sad emotional roller-coaster of a movie, but it's a very well-made and inspiring film. The film took the Oscar for Best Picture at the 1979 Academy Awards, along with Best Actor for Hoffman and Best Supporting Actress for Streep. If you don't mind a tearjerker, 'Kramer vs. Kramer' is a great film to watch. Grade: B+\", \"KRAMER VS KRAMER won five Oscars, including Best Picture of 1979. This intense and deeply moving family drama follows an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down when his wife of eight years, walks out on him, leaving him to care for his son and build a relationship with him he never had. Robert Benton's incisive screenplay presents us flawed, but real human beings with hearts, souls, and brains. For instance, in the scene where Joanna announces to Ted she's leaving him, she doesn't just storm out the door...she gives him the keys, her credit cards, the dry cleaning ticket, tells him which bills have been paid, and informs him she has withdrawn from their bank account the same amount of money she had when they were married, no more. This decision to leave was not a whim...it was thought about and Joanna felt, with no other option than to leave, if she was leaving she was going to do it properly...and with no specific plan in mind, she did not think it right to take Billy. Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer, a man so obsessed with bringing home the bacon, he had no clue that his life at home was crumbling into pieces. Meryl Streep also won an Oscar playing Joanna, the unhappy wife who we feel sympathy for in the beginning of the film but that all changes when she returns for her son. Hoffman is at the top of his form here. I always tear up during the scene where he tries to explain to Billy (Justin Henry, Oscar nominee) why his mom left and he does it all in a stage whisper or when he meets Joanna upon her return and slams her drink into a wall (a Hoffman moment not in the script that Streep was not told about in order to get a natural reaction). Justin Henry hits all the right notes as Billy, the confused little boy who doesn't know why his mom is gone and doesn't know how to communicate with his father. Jane Alexander also got an Oscar nod as Ted and Joanna's neighbor, Margaret, who has switched allegiances by the film's conclusion. This is an intense family drama but there are laughs to be had here too...Billy and the chocolate chip ice cream...Billy pouting because Ted is late picking him for a party...Billy catching his dad's one night stand (JoBeth Williams) on her way to the bathroom stark naked, but it's the moments of human drama you remember...Ted running through Manhattan with Billy in his arms to get to the emergency room after BIlly falls off the jungle gym...Ted getting fired right before beginning his custody battle and instead of making a scene, he tells the guy in a whisper...\\\"Shame on you.\\\" And of course, the finale where Joanna tells Ted she's not taking Billy, which I found a little hard to swallow. Why would she go to all that trouble of suing for custody and then just change her mind? But this is a small quibble regarding a wonderful movie, masterfully directed by Robert Benton and flawlessly performed by a top-notch cast. A must-see.\", \"This is a phenomenal movie. Truly one of the best movies I have ever watched. I am a serious critic and it takes much to stir me, but this movie had all the right combinations for \\\"stirring\\\". The passion of the actors,without the overacting, the aching for all the characters involved, the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce, all make this a must see movie, despite the fact that it is 1970s. This is definitely not an \\\"old movie\\\", but a classic/vintage movie. I hope you engage with it as I did when you consider how volatile relationships of all kinds can be, when you also consider how deep pain associated with love can be and how the hardest decisions to make will always be the most painful, but once they are made the pain will subside, but only gradually. This movie certainly demonstrates that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that leaving certainly is not synonymous with lost/lack of love. The 'crafting' of this movie certainly emanates from a place deep within someone's heart and mind.\", \"I have seen this film on 3 different occasions.On the first occasion,I was bowled over by this film.It appeared as a very kind film to me.I hated this film as a sentimental garbage on my second viewing.However my third viewing reasserted my belief that it is a good film.There is a lot of emotional power in this film especially scenes of emotional confrontation between Mr Kramer and Madam Kramer.There are some scenes in which Meryl Streep appears a cruel person despite the fact that she is a beauty in real life.Dustin Hoffman appears as a lost hero unable to grapple with the recent task of his child's custody.There was even a controversy on the sets of this film.According to the master cameraman Nestor Almendros there was a shot in which he just escaped getting hurt as the character of Mr.Kramer,in order to show the intensity of his anger,decides to break a glass hard.Luckily nothing happened to Nestor.Kramer versus Kramer shows the destruction of a family structure.It also tells how family must be maintained if there are kids involved.\", \"This is probably the best cinematic depiction of life in a Manhattan ad agency: the pressure to perform; client and agency demands; the parties; the creativity; the money; the cool surface with powerful corporate undercurrents.   Toss in parenthood for Dustin Hoffman.   The movie is textured and deep. It follows his internal relationship as he tries to understand and live with what's going on; his relationship with Meryl Streep (and her friend, who becomes his friend), and his the relationship with his son.   While Meryl Streep was great, did she set the record for least screen time to win an Oscar? She sure can deliver when she is on, though.\", \"Moving beyond words is this heart breaking story of a divorce which results in a tragic custody battle over a seven year old boy.  One of \\\"Kramer v. Kramer's\\\" great strengths is its screenwriter director Robert Benton, who has marvellously adapted Avery Corman's novel to the big screen. He keeps things beautifully simple and most realistic, while delivering all the drama straight from the heart. His talent for telling emotional tales like this was to prove itself again with \\\"Places in the Heart\\\", where he showed, as in \\\"Kramer v. Kramer\\\", that he has a natural ability for working with children.  The picture's other strong point is the splendid acting which deservedly received four of the film's nine Academy Award nominations, two of them walking away winners. One of those was Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor), who is superb as frustrated business man Ted Kramer, a man who has forgotten that his wife is a person. As said wife Joanne, Meryl Streep claimed the supporting actress Oscar for a strong, sensitive portrayal of a woman who had lost herself in eight years of marriage. Also nominated was Jane Alexander for her fantastic turn as the Kramer's good friend Margaret. Final word in the acting stakes must go to young Justin Henry, whose incredibly moving performance will find you choking back tears again and again, and a thoroughly deserved Oscar nomination came his way.  Brilliant also is Nestor Almendros' cinematography and Jerry Greenberg's timely editing, while musically Henry Purcell's classical piece is used to effect.  Truly this is a touching story of how a father and son come to depend on each other when their wife and mother leaves. They grow together, come to know each other and form an entirely new and wonderful relationship. Ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new outlook on life, and slowly comes to realise why Joanne had to go.  Certainly if nothing else, \\\"Kramer v. Kramer\\\" demonstrates that nobody wins when it comes to a custody battle over a young child, especially not the child himself.  Saturday, June 10, 1995 - T.V.  Strong drama from Avery Corman's novel about the heartache of a custody battle between estranged parents who both feel they have the child's best interests at heart. Aside from a superb screenplay and amazingly controlled direction, both from Robert Benton, it's the superlative cast that make this picture such a winner.  Hoffman is brilliant as Ted Kramer, the man torn between his toppling career and the son whom he desperately wants to keep. Excellent too is Streep as the woman lost in eight years of marriage who had to get out before she faded to nothing as a person. In support of these two is a very strong Jane Alexander as mutual friend Margaret, an outstanding Justin Henry as the boy caught in the middle, and a top cast of extras.  This highly emotional, heart rending drama more than deserved it's 1979 Academy Awards for best film, best actor (Hoffman) and best supporting actress (Streep).  Wednesday, February 28, 1996 - T.V.\", \"Ever since `Midnight Cowboy' I have been on the lookout for films with Dustin Hoffman and have mostly not been disappointed. Ever since `Kramer vs Kramer' I have been on the lookout for films with Meryl Streep and have mostly not been disappointed. She gave a superb performance, really one of her best, in `Sophie's Decision' and I lapped her up in `Out of Africa'. That these two actors came together over 20 years ago for `Kramer vs Kramer' was definitely a very good idea: the result is an excellent character drama with a theme which is still very relevant in today's society.  On divorcing everyone has a pretty bad time, though the kids seem to suffer most\\u0085\\u0085\\u0085..Beautifully handled by Robert Benton in some original directing presenting some memorable scenes: even the passageway takes on character and should be included in the cast! And as for the breakfast scene with Billy (Justin Henry), just simply magnificent. Just how do you get an eight-year-old to act? Benton managed it, and of course with Hoffman there seemed to be good electricity: the result is certainly engaging, endearing, and convincing. Justin Henry's performance must rank among the best 5 or 6 kids' performances of all time. The best thing, once again, was the naturalness, there was no going over the top, so frequent these days.  This film came up again on the small screen the other night, though I have had it in my video collection for years: it is still worth watching and paying attention to everything. Around 7\\u00bd out of 10.\", \"Life was going great for New York City advertising artist Ted Kramer. He had a great job and a loving wife. No, actually, his wife wasn't so loving, for when Ted returned home late from work that night his wife, Joanna, had a suit case packed and was heading out the door. He tried to stop her, but she just got into the elevator and out of Ted's life. Well, now in addition to his job he's now got to mind the house as well as their 6-year-old son, Billy; Ted assured his boss that his wife's leaving would not affect his job performance in any way. It did however affect his performance as a father. He blew up when Billy spilled punch on his client artwork! Well, some time later Ted and Billy receive a letter from Joanna, and it was obvious from her letter that she wasn't coming back. Ted was distraught. Well, he was late coming home from work on Billy's birthday, which made Billy sore at him.   Ted was late to work one day and his boss yelled at him because he had missed a very important client meeting. When he got home, he yelled at Billy for sneaking ice cream during dinner. Then later he truthfully told Billy that the break-up between he and Joanna may have been his fault, not Billy's; Ted invited a good friend, Phyllis Bernard over that night, and well, Billy got his first look at a naked woman. When Ted took Billy to the park the following day, he fell off the jungle gym and landed face-first onto his toy plane. Ted literally ran him to the hospital where they had to administer stitches. After that, life began taking a downward spiral for Ted. Then one day out of the blue he received a phone call from none other than Joanna! They met in a corner caf\\u00e9. At first they have a pleasant conversation but then Joanna informs him that she has returned to collect her son and take him with her. Ted would have none of it and stormed out. Well life got even worse for Ted when his boss, Jim O'Connor, took him out to lunch and abruptly fired him. Not only that but Joanna was choosing to sue for custody of Billy, and without a job, Ted didn't stand a chance in hell for winning. He hired himself a lawyer, John Shaunessy, who charged a pretty penny: $15,000 exact change. And that's IF they win.   Ted was also able to find a new job. It was actually a step down from what he used to do with a considerable cut in salary but he accepted with great determination. Finally the court date, January 9, 1980, arrived. Judge Atkins presiding. Joanna took the stand and Shaunessy proceeded to question her about why she left Ted and about her other relationships and how they were failures. The next day, Ted took the stand and Joanna's lawyer really grilled him like a cheeseburger. Ted's good friend Margaret took the stand as well and she really didn't help matters. Well, the judge took some time to think it over and sure enough, one day Shaunessy informs Ted that he lost. Joanna got sole custody of Billy. How typical! Always ruling in favor of the mother. Well, Ted and Billy were just devastated about parting ways. They had a tearful goodbye when suddenly Joanna stopped by. She and Ted have a little talk and well, rather than just give away the ending, let me assure everybody that everything turns out alright for everybody!  This was a very good movie. Dustin Hoffman was very good. He earned that Academy Award. I've also seen him in Hook, Meet the Fockers and Rain Man, which he also won an Oscar for. Meryl Streep was good. She also got an Oscar. Justin Henry was good too, so where was his nomination? I guess the Academy had a rule against giving Oscars to children, but the rule was lifted when Haley Joel Osment came along. This movie has great drama, light comedy, and is very subtle. It does a good job of holding your attention. I was watching Rain Man on TCM the other night then this came on after and I just couldn't help but watch. And that's what you should do. If you like Dustin Hoffman or Meryl Streep or movies of this genre, then I recommend Kramer vs. Kramer! A gripping film about the pangs of two divorced parents fighting over their child. I liked Ted's little speech about ruling in favor of mothers all the time. What was it about sex that makes a good parents? Actually, that's how they have the child. But seriously, he's right. Why always rule in favor of the mother because she's a woman? Also in the cast, George Coe, Howard Duff, who passed away in 1990, and Howland Chamberlain who passed away in 1984. Watch for an up-and-coming JoBeth Williams in the nudity in the hallway scene. Anyway, see Kramer vs. Kramer today!!! Good movie!!  -\", \"Good drama movie about a child custody case with great performances by all the actors.A good example of what an excellent script can do to propel a simple story to a much higher quality.The screenplay was just average though and this is what kept the movie from the list of the all time best dramas.Still,the great acting makes this movie a good one to see if you are a fan of court dramas or a big fan of the lead actors.The movie really should have been a tad longer though for more excellence but that would really be nitpicking......\", \"The child actor certainly deserves a lot of credit. It was a pretty weak field for Best Picture that year. I think \\\"Apocalypse Now\\\" should have taken it, but the Academy probably felt it was too violent and strange, plus Vietnam was still too recent. Meryl Streep was tremendous, as always, playing a very unlikeable character. I don't usually compliment directors, but I really liked that bit with the elevator doors. Grade: B\", \"I remember going to drive inn with my parent and sister. I was in grade 5, and still a kid, and the drive closed down 4 years later, but the film still lingers in my memory. An adult movie, which a kid finds entertaining. That is a mark of excellence. Hoffman is one of hollywoods better actors, and this film proves it. I like the Billy put down the ice cream scene, and I remember the SCTV version in there film I factory myself. Remember Joe Flairty crying. Please email me if you like the SCTV skit. Not a bad film at all, it is a story about a father, and his son. Touching and intertaining, I love the part where Hoffman talks about Killroy, and how the streets change. Worth a second watch. 7/10\", \"If you asked me to pick the best acted movies ever made, this movie would be on a short list along with 1951's Streetcar Named Desire. I imagine i'll discover some others that qualify, but Kramer vs Kramer is an outstanding exercise in naturalism. So its a very satisfying experience on that level: just watching the marvelous, probing performances of Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and the child Justin Henry in particular. One of the best child performances ever.  But I also find it very satisfying to watch, because its such a thoroughly involving story - it always makes me forget my own problems. It has such excellent narrative drive. Once you stick Kramer vs Kramer on, and Alice Kramer leaves Ted to juggle work and their young son, telling him nothing more than she has to discover herself - you keep watching to know that everything turns out okay for them. And even once you know how things do turn out, each moment of the ride just rings so brilliantly true that its a joy to watch it happen again and again.  Make no mistake - Kramer vs Kramer is not light entertainment: its a very realistic portrayal of the effects of divorce on everyone involved.  10/10.  For one of the best scripts (born out of conversations between Benton and Hoffman, who was going through a divorce at the time) ever written, executed and performed beautifully and faultlessly. Not to mention what a great, involving story it is. Put simply, a perfect film.\", \"I thought this film was quite good and quite entertaining for a film heavy on emotion. I agree with what another user wrote about the script being sympathetic to the three main characters. I think that this is what what made the film good. It didn't villainies either Mr. or Mrs. Kramer and it was refreshing, I think, to see two people essentially work the issue out on their own and eventually do the best thing for Billy. And, although it was a little strange, I actually liked the music in this film as well. For some reason the music seemed appropriate for the journey that the three main characters embarked upon. This movie flowed quite well and didn't doodle, like some emotionally heavy films tend to do. It dealt with a serious situation but didn't take itself too seriously. It simply told the story in a straight forward way and it worked quite well.\", \"Normally, movies stay out of the realm of \\\"domestic drama,\\\" and for good reason: who wants to intentionally seek entertainment from a story about what they or those close to them have to deal with in real life? Divorce hurts an incredible percentage of American families of all classes and custody battles are ugly and necessary parts of it. That's not escapism -- the number one reason the average person turns to movies -- that's sad reality.   Normally, divorce or custody is simply part of a greater story and affects the way we understand it or relate to its characters. \\\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\\" focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why that makes it so troubling. That's a challenge for both this film and its audience: turn something so real into something that can capture our attention and then make us not feel spiteful as the mirror is held up to our face. Writer/director Robert Benton definitely achieves both and in impressive fashion in adapting this novel by Avery Corman.  The story, as one would expect, is quite simple: Big business advertising man Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) comes home to find his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) is leaving him and their 7-year-old son Billy (Justin Henry). Ted then must quickly learn to be an active father in the boys' life and as soon as he does, Joanna brings a custody suit upon him.  To make an Oscar-winning drama about something so generic and particularly dialogue- heavy first takes tremendous acting talent. You don't get much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is in his prime in this role: his first Oscar win after three other notable nominations. He creates a thorough character, one whose self-centered and quick-tempered ways clearly change as he learns to be a better father and the sole care-giver. Streep wins her first Oscar in only the second major role of her career as a woman who doesn't get much screen time but must communicate both inner torment at her decision to leave as well as renewed sense of identity when she returns to take custody. Streep does so effortlessly. The young boy, Justin Henry, who at his age was the youngest competitive category nominee in Academy Awards history, plays the embodiment of all 7-year-old children exceptionally well.  Benton's writing and direction takes these performances to the level where we see deeper into this family's troubles than we do our own and thus reconsider our thoughts about love and raising a family. Benton's previous notable credits (\\\"Bonnie & Clyde\\\" and \\\"Superman\\\") wouldn't indicate a strong command of family drama, but the man can flat out write. Numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they depict. The first morning that Joanna is gone and Ted make's Billy french toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent going into this movie in a scene that happens in Americans' kitchens every morning.  You'll rarely see a story as straightforward as \\\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\\" done better. There aren't any surprises at the end or twists and turns that will keep us desperately glued to the screen. The film then has to rely on its talents and they are all sure-fire, delivering a new understanding of a subject that's so familiar.\", \"Certainly when I saw this movie at HBO, I was bit erratic in following the plot, but it catches my attention when seeing Dustin Hoffman in it. Honestly I'm not enthralled watching old movies, but then in the long run it changes my point of view. Seeing this stirring film made me experience once again couching at my seat not noticing my tears suddenly roll down my cheek, and then after, let loose a heavy sigh in realizing the impact of what I've just witness. Kramer vs Kramer was indeed one of the best classical drama movies I've witnessed for a long time that even I, myself couldn't imagine how it touched me. The story was strongly emotional, but is not saturated with such. The characters weren't unrealistic for their roles; they possess qualities that make viewers like them whatever position they have in the film, like the role of Meryl Streep, she was a mother who honestly concede her mistakes at the past but then she's confident to stand up her emotional motives to get what she desires in a fair and square battle. Dustin Hoffman was way too outstanding, I can't even fathom how this guy could play seriously difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role which is completely different, then performed it well. Even though I have already seen the movies a lot of times, when I seat back and lounge at my home scanning worth movies to peer and buy a time for it, catching a glimpse for Kramer vs Kramer will make my experience another worthwhile moment.\", \"Kramer Vs. Kramer is a near-heartening drama about shocking, drastic augmentations of the two subjects of a failed married couple. Meryl Streep, in the throes of her trademark maternal sensitivity, plays an unhappy stay-at-home mother who feels confined to such a role and within the first five minutes of the film leaves her inattentive husband, in a fantastic performance by Dustin Hoffman, to find another role for herself. Hoffman is dumbstruck, having absolutely no idea what to do with himself, having taken so much for granted that he doesn't know the first thing about getting his son to school in the morning.  Hoffman seamlessly characterizes this husband as such a juicy load of setbacks. He is restless, relentless and impatient, but even though the positive side to those three adjectives should include just the opposite, he is unremittingly fixated on whatever he turns his head to. He's been focused on his career in advertising, and when he is left to raise his son Billy all by himself, chaos ushers in immediately. He's the one throwing temper tantrums and quitting angrily halfway through an activity. After awhile, as he befriends his neighbor and Joanna's former friend, played by sexy Jane Alexander, Hoffman cools his jets enough to understand why his wife left. In the meantime, his boundless energy redirects towards raising Billy and he loses his job.  The custody battle of the title is a brilliantly grey circumstance. Even if the ending is a little unmotivated, subjectified for the audience, the last line and the last shot still have that witty screen writing touch that seemed to diminish after the magical 1970s.\", \"I've seen many Dustin Hoffman's movies like Straw Dogs or Rain Man and I liked them, but his characters are much to often calm or even shy persons. I expected him to be in this movie the same as he was in Straw Dogs, but I saw a totally different person. He was much more energetic in this film and kinda reminded me of Al Pacino in Serpico. The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end. I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son. This movie is also revealing. Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.\", \"Kramer vs. Kramer is the story of a marital breakup and the consequences of same. They can be devastating to the partners and even more so to a minor child which in this case is played by Justin Henry.  What I really did like about Kramer vs. Kramer, it's greatest strength as a film is the way that parents Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep are presented to the audience as whole people with many sides to their nature. Though the film is slanted in Hoffman's direction and more about his relationship with his son, he's not presented as any kind of saint, nor is Streep a completely black villain. Hoffman's a career oriented man in the advertising game. He's pretty much ignored his wife's dreams and aspirations, still it's a big shock to him when Streep says the love's no longer there and she wants out. She also wants out of being a mother, at least for a while.  Hoffman and Henry make do the best they can. The pressure of being both parents causes Hoffman to lose his job and he has to take a lower paying one in another agency. At that point after over a year, Streep decides she wants custody.  Both parents make compelling witnesses and state their case beautifully, but in these situations, the tie is always broken in favor of the mother.  Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep won their first of two Oscars respectively for this film, her in the Supporting Actress category. I'm not sure how these things are decided, Streep does get less screen time than Hoffman if that's the determining factor. The film does focus on Hoffman's relationship with his son and his evolving realization that he has his share of the blame for the marriage failure. As for Meryl it's a Hob's choice for her as it is for many women, to balance a career and motherhood. The conflict in her psyche registers for all to see on the screen.  Dustin Hoffman may have won that Oscar partly for the same reason that Spencer Tracy picked up his first, by performing the impossible task of not letting a scene stealing child steal the film. Children with their lack of inhibitions are natural actors and Henry is great because he comes over as a real kid, not a Hollywood kid. I wonder if Hoffman saw Captains Courageous and saw how Spencer Tracy dealt with Freddie Bartholomew. Dustin could have done a lot worse than channel Spencer Tracy in his performance.  Kramer vs. Kramer also won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Benton and Best Adapted Screenplay. It's an intelligent and compelling drama about adults falling out of love and trying to deal as best they can with it for themselves and their child. Don't miss it if ever broadcast.\", \"The marriage of an upscale New York City couple with child falls apart when the wife wants out (\\\"It took a lot of courage for her to walk out that door!\\\" a neighbor tells us); the busy, distracted husband takes on the \\\"motherly\\\" responsibilities and grows closer to his son, but soon the wife returns. Highly manipulative picture doesn't give us a very realistic familial unit (with young Justin Henry certainly not resembling the product of a marriage between Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep!), but the dynamics are intriguing and involving, and director Robert Benton keeps the pace popping with lots of cleverness, marvelous classical music, canny editing and surefire bits of humor. Streep's character is designed to be a cold, self-centered witch, but I was ready to feel a lot more for her than Benton probably wanted. It all has to be painted in terms of black and white, good and bad, with Hoffman learning how hard his wife had it and getting a second chance at being a good parent. The film never falters from its preconceived path, and very fine acting nearly saves it, but I'm not sure where Benton was steering the film in the final act, and the closing scene is awfully abrupt. *** from ****\", \"No, this has nothing to do with the sitcom \\\"Seinfeld\\\" or its eccentric and hilarious character Cosmo Kramer. In reality, \\\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\\" is a fine drama movie, without a doubt one of the finest of its kind and one of the greatest movies ever. I'm glad that it won more Oscars than \\\"Apocalypse Now\\\" because it really deserved such glory.  \\\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\\" is an excellent film, so well made and so perfectly balanced that I wouldn't change anything about it in any way. There is nothing wrong with the film. It's film-making of the highest quality. And it stands the test of time, too. Not only it doesn't look any dated, but also its cultural impact is long-lasting and its realistic story remains just as significant as it was when it came out in 1979. A timeless classic. They don't make movies like this today.  This movie is dramatic, realistic, simple but brilliant, intense, powerful, sweet and even tragic and depressing sometimes. Yet, it has fine humor as well. It has no special effects, but who cares? This is not the movie or place to discuss such thing. For a movie like this, such thing would be pointless and absolutely unnecessary.  The story is very interesting. The actors's chemistry is just perfect. All of the actors are great, but the 3 main ones are the very best. Dustin Hoffman, a brilliant actor, has his greatest performance ever here as the lovable but distant workaholic Ted Kramer. Meryl Streep is great as Ted's wife, Joanna. And cute little Justin Henry is terrific as the loving but sometimes stubborn Billy, son of Ted and Joanna.  The soundtrack is all instrumental and wonderful. The opening song (by the guitarist Frederic Hand) is brilliant. The rest of the soundtrack is mostly Antonio Vivaldi's classical music and is simply dazzling.  This motion picture has also an incredible development of the characters. See the character Ted Kramer: a workaholic who becomes an amazing father after being left with no choice but to take care of his son, trying to adjust these new responsibilities with his job after being left by his wife Joanna. With this, Ted learns about the most beautiful things in life, but also realizes how though life is, with the problems in his job and the return of Joanna, who wants the custody of their son. But even Joanna changes for better and the ending is an unexpected surprise when one sees this for the first time.  This movie has also some though things, such as courtroom scenes where both Ted and Joanna face brutal character assassinations unleashed by the lawyers. Another though thing to see is when poor Billy falls off a jungle gym with his toy (a plane) and gets seriously injured on his face. But then again, the scene is very well made and what comes next is very intense: his father runs quickly and crosses numerous blocks, ignoring the traffic to take his son to the hospital.  Overall, this is a movie which is a good lesson of life.  This should definitely be on Top 250.\", \"I think not! I mean yeah if you compare this film to The Godfather, or maybe a little older film like Casablanca, or maybe even a little newer film like The English Patient. It doesn't have the camera work or the cinematography like these other films, but that doesn't mean that this is a bad movie, or does it? I think the reason why this film is underrated is because a lot of people always compare it to other great Oscar winning films (you should never do that) which makes it hard to understand the beauty and the realism in this movie. In the categories Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, this film really deserved all of them. The magnificent Dustin Hoffman gives us, once again, one of his best performances. A couple of times in this movie I forgot that it wasn't his son because it was just so real! I have never seen a film about relationships in different families where it was so easy for the actors to play that specific role but still so beautiful. So Dustin Hoffman passes the test with flying colors, in my opinion. There are a few actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best: Katherine Hepburn, Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman (I can't help it, I think she's great). Meryl Streep, even though she's in a supporting role, is amazing and real and you just can't help but being drawn ed to her talent and the way she makes it hers and real. Wow, that's all I can say. Justin Henry was great considering his age, his tears and his relationship with his mom and dad was beautiful, so I say good job to cute little Justin Henry.   While I was watching this film for like the third time, alone, I couldn't stop crying. I tried but I couldn't. Thank god I was alone! This is probably the purest film I have ever seen. Other films that were nominated for Best Picture was Apocalypse Now, Norma Rae, Breaking Away and All That Jazz. I'm ashamed, cause I haven't seen any of them, but from what I've heard, Apocalypse Now is great but when I heard about Norma Rae I only thought of Sally Field. I think that considering the other nominees, this film deserved it's five Oscars, and that it'll continue to touch and make other people cry for a long time in the future, just like it has for the past 28 years. Good job all the actors and actresses in this film for giving us great performances and memories from watching this film that we won't ever forget.  Thanks for your time.\", \"I consider myself lucky that I got to view a wonderful movie with two marvelous actors. \\\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\\" was great to me because I think I could relate to it.  Unfortunately, my parents are divorced. Even though I was older than Billy in this movie, I felt his pain and confusion. Having two parents who you thought were happy and end up hating each other is the worst. Through this movie, actually, I think it made me realize that my parents are people too, and they had as just much pain as my sister and I had.  Back to the movie, this was a good one. Yes, it's dated and Meryl and Dustin are very young. But I would recommend this for a lot of people, because I think most can relate in some way. There are funny, sad, happy, and relieving moments that are carried away terrificly by these great actors. It's a good movie and deserves more credit than a 7.5.  9/10\", \"After a decade of turbulent unrest, American movies began to switch gears and turn their cameras away from war-torn battlefields, political corruption, and general social unease to the more intimate world of family dysfunction. The toll the selfish Baby Boomers began to take on the American family as they grew up and had kids of their own was making itself felt.  \\\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\\" is one of the first of these dysfunctional family dramas that would continue to be so popular throughout the 1980s, and it's one of the best. It gets a rather bum rap now, because it's known as the film that beat \\\"Apocalypse Now\\\" for the 1979 Best Picture Academy Award, but comparing these two films is like comparing a banana to a marinated chicken breast: they're not remotely the same, but can't we enjoy them both? Director/writer Robert Benton doesn't try to do anything fancy with his movie; its strength lies in its performances, those of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep particularly, playing a divorced couple fighting childishly and selfishly over their son. The courtroom scene in which they duke it out for custody, and in which each is forced to hurt the other in terrible ways, is devastating, and feels authentic. The movie doesn't present Hoffman's solid dad as a hero, or Streep's straying mom as a villain. They're neither good or bad as people -- they're simply bad at being married.  The film is tear-jerky at the finale, but not in a manipulative way. It earns its right to elicit sobs.  Grade: A\", \"Kramer vs. Kramer is one film to hold on too and not forget. It isn't one of the most popular films ever made and is certainly one of the weakest best picture films, but it does not mean it still isn't important. I thought the movie was well done and made you just want to watch more and more of it. The performances were the best positive for the film and Dustin Hoffman played one of his best roles he's ever done as the lonely workaholic who has to take care of his son, as his wife separates from him. Billy, who is Hoffman's son, played another great performance along with Meryl Streep, playing the depressed mother of Billy. Kramer vs. Kramer is not one of the greatest films and is not a perfect 10, but it succeeds in making the film worth watching and worth caring about it. Certainly, one of Hoffman's best films he's ever done. I highly recommend it.  Hedeen's Outlook: 9/10 ***+ A-\", \"Although credit should have been given to Dr. Seuess for stealing the story-line of \\\"Horton Hatches The Egg\\\", this was a fine film. It touched both the emotions and the intellect. Due especially to the incredible performance of seven year old Justin Henry and a script that was sympathetic to each character (and each one's predicament), the thought provoking elements linger long after the tear jerking ones are over. Overall, superior acting from a solid cast, excellent directing, and a very powerful script. The right touches of humor throughout help keep a \\\"heavy\\\" subject from becoming tedious or difficult to sit through. Lastly, this film stands the test of time and seems in no way dated, decades after it was released.\", \"This outstanding film has about the best acting that you'll ever see, and that alone makes this a must-see. The entire cast is excellent, but then again, it had to be in order to keep up with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. It didn't take me long to get hooked on this film, and aside from a courtroom scene that is merely good, this is top-notch entertainment. This is a rare film that actually deserved all the Oscar recognition that it received. See it for yourself and you will definitely not be disappointed.\", \"\\\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\\" is a terrific drama about an unhappy woman who walks out on her husband and young son. The husband now has to take up the responsibilities of taking care of the boy. As he does, they get to know each other better. But then, the mother and wife returns, and she wants custody of the boy. \\\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\\" has lots of drama with some wonderful bits of comedy thrown in for good measure. Dustin Hoffman won his first Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant performance here. Most people say his performance in \\\"Rainman\\\", which won him his second Oscar, is his best. He was great in that film, but I disagree that its his best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this movie. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors working today. He's also funny at times. Also giving a terrific performance is Meryl Streep, who wasn't as well known when she made this film like she is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress) for her work in \\\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\\" as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family. Justin Henry, who was only 8 years old when the film came out, is wonderful as Hoffman and Streep's son. He won an Oscar nomination for his role here, and still to this day he is the youngest performer to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also fine as a conserned family friend. She too got an Oscar nomination (for Supporting Actress where she lost to co-star Streep). \\\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\\" is a great film from start to finish. Writer-director Robert Benton has made a film that's absolutely unforgettable.   **** (out of four)\"], \"review_score\": [10, 9, 9, 8, 9, 10, 7, 8, 7, 7, 9, 10, 7, 7, 9, 8, 9, 10, 9, 10, 10, 8, 10, 9, 9, 8, 9, 10, 9, 10], \"review_category\": [\"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 8.8}, \"Kundun\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0119485\", \"total_review_count\": 3, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"In an early episode of The Sopranos two of the younger gangsters are forced to wait for entry into a nightclub when Scorcese pulls up and is ushered into the club as a VIP.  \\\"*I* liked Kundun!\\\" shouts one of the gangsters, irony oozing out of the screenplay.  I had received that episode of The Sopranos through my rental queue and Kundun was due to arrive as the next disc. Spooky. That comment made me think it was not going to be a good film. And it isn't a good film The first 30 minutes are greatly hampered by some very stilted performances from a cast clearly struggling in an English language project. They manage to convey less emotion and commitment than the puppets in Parker & Stone's Team America.  As the film goes on the central performances improve but the pace of the thing never really picks up. The plot manages to be both epic (nations collide) and small (boy grows up) at the same time, but it is ultimately the smallness that you are left with : the story simply never takes off.  The Dalai Lama is, rightly, played with a stillness and spirituality but there are not enough moments where this stillness is played off against more fiery elements or where any wit shines through - we're simply expected to look at the unblinking face and think \\\"aaaah. Such wisdom!\\\" Well, sorry, I need a bit more than that.  Finally, there are some arty shots that look reasonably attractive but are not made transcendental as they seem not to add anything to the surrounding (in)action.

Just what have we done to deserve it?  Unfortunately this is at the same mediocre level of Brad Pitt's offering. It's slow and laboured pace does it no favours at all and we are asked, like children, to stare in spiritual wonderment at things that are not worth the time or the effort. Martin Scorsese finds himself well and truly outside of his usual territory here and instead of the stunning personal storytelling we're used to from him, we are bogged down with all sorts of ridiculous mumbo-jumbo and a somewhat confined take on the history of China and Tibet. I can't imagine he enjoyed this experience much.  Not to say the direction and cinematography isn't great, Scorsese is a born filmmaker and knows what to do with a camera, just that the choice of project does him no justice whatsoever.

This is the worst movie I've seen since Neighbors. Anyone who watches this movie will sit there thinking, hoping, that eventually something will happen, that there will be a laugh, or something, anything, will happen to break the slow motion dragging along, wondering if they should get up and leave now or have faith that maybe something is going to happen, but it never does. If theaters gave refunds when people were dissatisfied with a movie, this turkey would have been dropped like a hot potato the third day out. I have lost all faith in critics. I guess they think this movie was deeeeep.\", \"Lost In Translation is a very well-crafted film. Lance Acord's cinematography is nothing short of masterful. The acting from the leads is nuanced, characters memorable.   The film's casual racism, however, is deeply regrettable. Almost every scene revels in the throwaway mockery of the Japanese: accents, language, culture, stature: all are subject to a torrent of snide belittling by the film- makers. What's more shocking is that more attention hasn't been called to this. Put another way: if this film was set in Africa and contained similarly juvenile mockery of the populace, there'd doubtless be uproar.  All in all, a well-made film severely let down by an unforgivable streak of crass racism.\", \"I have seen some truly awful films in my life, but this scrapes the bottom of the barrel.  It's as if a bunch of film-school try-hards were sent to Japan, without a script, and told to produce the most pointless cinematic experience possible. Partway throught the film, these film-school rejects meet a representative from the Japanese Tourist Board who pays them to insert further meaningless 'postcard' views of Japan.  So, what could I learn from this film? - Gee, aren't the Japanese quirky and strange - Gee, isn't it difficult when I am in another country and I can't speak the language - Gee, isn't it strange that I feel alienated when I am in another country and make no effort to genuinely appreciate the culture or people - Gee, even shallow people can 'connect' when they meet other shallow people and decide to have a good whinge.  The most insulting part of this whole mess is that it is currently rated, on this website, as the 175th best movie of all time.  I weep for humanity.\", \"What is it about this turgid piece of rubbish that attracts such high praise? It's long, it's dull, and it goes absolutely nowhere. There are no spoilers in this review - there's nothing to spoil. The story, such as it is, centres on one dull American who meets another. To make this story more interesting, it's set in Tokyo, not the US. Whoopee! The characters are still dull, but they're in an interesting place. This could have converted the movie into something that had a pulse, but unfortunately Ms Coppola sucks the life out of one of the most vibrant cities in the world and reduces it to a caricature. Tokyo deserves better than this - and it's had Godzilla to contend with...\", \"I should preface this review by saying that my husband and I both have advanced degrees, and we see 50+ independent films a year. So filmic subtlety is not lost on us. We drove for an hour through horrendous traffic to see this highly-rated film, yet this is the only movie in 25 years of adult moviegoing that we have ever walked out of. It reminded me of the worst excesses of 60's French New Wave. Long stretches of people staring. Long stretches of silence and monosyllables. More long stretches of loud noise and incomprehensible voices. Short cut-in scenes that advanced the story (what there was of it) and characters not a bit. We get it; we get it--these people are ALIENated. Big deal.  Can I care about two people who are supposed to be intelligent, yet they can't think of a thing to do to amuse themselves in one of the world's major cities? Can I believe in a young woman who's supposed to be a recent philosophy graduate of Yale, who can't think of anything to do with her time but stare out the window of her expensive hotel? Can I believe this same young woman came to Tokyo with her working husband, yet seems totally at a loss when he actually leaves to work? Can I believe that someone who is interested in philosophy so much that she majors in it in college can only be happy bar hopping, dancing, smoking weed, and singing karaoke? Can I believe that a faded Hollywood star who is being paid 2 million dollars for a commercial would come to Tokyo absolutely alone, without even an aide of any kind?  And most of all, can I call a film that does nothing more than follow these two hapless and uninteresting people around for several days without a trace of drama or art profound?  I think not. Don't waste your money. This is one of those rare instances when I can only conclude that there is some vast critical conspiracy to hoodwink the American public. Surprise! The emperor has no clothes.\", \"I was appalled that Sofia Coppola won an Oscar for her drab screenplay. First of all, the characters were unsympathetic and out of touch with the world. An actor receiving 2 million for a few days work and a directionless Yale student tagging with her photographer boyfriend. I doubt many of us here have the privilege to be bored in the most expensive hotel in Japan.  The stylized ennui of the whole pic was so pretentious. Scarletts panty shots and staring at the window didn't elevate or convey any emotion at all. I really had to force myself awake at times when the whole film veered into an extended travelogue or a home movie. I kept on waiting for the nonexistent plot to arrive.  Finally, the 'crocodile dundee' style racism showing the Japanese as one dimensional morons or subservient. The prostitute scene was a cheap play for laughs. Much like, most of the Japanese scenes which were the 'look at the wacky Japanese' variety with the help of Bill's snide comments. If Sofia wanted to portray loneliness and isolation, she could have easily done it without the racist undertone.\", \"Imagine hearing the major critics on the top of the roof on the skycraper sing boisterous praise for one of the five hundred 'qualified masterpieces', and Lost in Translation somehow received the honor bestowed on Sofia Coppola and company. Big mistake.  Lost in Translation is one of these movies that at first you might be seeing a terrific movie, but as it progress it become drab, droll and tedious without justification in substance. There's really no story to speak of -- only paper-thin basic with inanely banterous dialogue.  There may be a merit in cinematography that raise the artistic value of this movie, but because the story is non-existent and the characters utterly unsympathetic & boring to watch, cinematography -- stationary in some scenes and moving in others -- somehow negate the enjoyability of the movie by focusing on the ludicrous aspect of tedium as if Sofia could bring back the element of silence inspired by silent films of the early 20th century.  Lost in Translation (er, Sofia) abuse the silence element as the expression of meaning when it really add *nothing* of substance to the aesthetics of the movie, artistic or otherwise. It's utterly meaningless if one does not understand the express purpose of silence at the right moment to convey the humanistic value of life in the hectic and modern world. Sofia is being altruistic to the detriment of the audience when it comes to the vanity of the characters as portrayed Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson which generated zero empathy that makes the movie even less interesting to watch in a continuous manner without becoming fidgety or letting out relaxing yawn. There's nothing of interest what happen to the main characters and why should the audience give a care.  Sofia made the blunders in filming and keeping the scenes from the fate of being tossed into the cutting room trash bin that are particularly unintentionally humorous in being unabashedly pretentious or idiotically embarrassing. Like the English pronunciation-mangling Japanese hooker in the hotel room and the pointless, unromantic conversations with Bill & Scarlett characters who somehow fall in love while possessing ice-cold personalities that would make Mr. Freeze blush in humbled shame. And the movie moves in the glacial pace that makes it atrocious to watch -- it is the cinematic exercise in tedium for the sake of artistic expression, without tightening up. It drags on and on until the audience feel nothing but contempt for the characters and especially the screenwriter/director responsible for torture by mean of boring the audience to death.  Sofia once mentioned her favorite movie director is Terrence Malick. Mr. Malick is a completely different filmmaker who knows how to convey the meaning of silence in the poetic setting because Malick has experience observing nature and human qualities as a former philosophy professor & translator. Sofia did not because she doesn't get the aesthetics combined with silence without the backbone of a rich story and characterization. The Virgin Suicides, Sofia's debut movie, is well-made and competent, but Lost in Translation is such a trainwreck in terms of lackluster substance & poor, drag-on editing that lend to experiencing boredom. This boredom probably reflect the period of boredom at certain points of her life, and she parlay that experience as a form of torture to inflict the mental anguish of tedium on the audience in vengeance.   Scarlett Johannson and Bill Murrey, while accomplished movie actors in their right, do the barest minimum except mug to the camera in the aura of exulting \\\"Sundance Film Festival\\\" self-importance that elevate this movie to the new level (more like bottom 100) in high art, with moronically sedate monotony & meandering tedium thrown in. Bill's acting is nothing special save comedy and Scarlett is moderately competent but technically bad in dramatic acting (which makes it a safe bet she'll never be nominated for Best Actress Oscar in her lifetime, UK's BAFTA Best Actress award clinch for subpar, vacant, minimalist acting style partially blamed on Sofia's tepid, fumbling directional style & a future hard-*** director demanding spectacular acting notwithstanding).  Frankly, I do not know how Lost in Translation screenplay appealed to Scarlett and Bill Murray. It may be a character study, but does it delve into humanities, psychology and philosophy? No. It's more like a staid travelogue populated with non-descript characters that say absolutely nothing but dumb banter then fade to the pretty backdrop with the main characters wandering for a few minutes too long. This script won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for nothing but silence, banter, silence, banter, silence, inaudible whisper, fade to end? When the critics claim the movie have substance that the audience could not spot and decipher and call us stupid for being oblivious, I say the true design of Lost in Translation is that it is an introvertible proof The Emperor's New Clothes carry a valid allegory that apply to Sofia's vapid, utterly worthless filmflam that, next to Corey Haim's 1989 video diary \\\"Me, Myself & I\\\", might serve as an ideal audio-visual torture device. Because Sofia wants the audience to experience what she endured, and so we the viewers get the taste of her bitter medicine of a puerile existence, similar to what Vincent Gallo did with the cheerfully self-indulgent \\\"Buffalo 66\\\".  Zero star out of four\", \"I was watching this movie and it came to a point where it had dragged on so long that I was anxious for it to be over, so I checked the time and only fifteen minutes had passed since the beginning of the movie. I spent money to rent it so I kept watching it for another 45 minutes...still no plot after an hour. I would say what the movie is about, but I don't know that it's really about anything. It's a conglomeration of pointless scenes that don't make up a story. I was expecting a great film considering it's 8.0 ranking here at imdb, but for the life of me, I can't figure out how one person would think this movie is in any way good, let alone fifteen thousand. This one has apparently done well at the film festivals, so that should be enough of a sign to steer clear of it. Indie movies are indie for a reason...they suck. This is a great one to rent if you struggle with insomnia.\", \"To my mind this is just an average ordinary silly film. The entire film takes place in an hotel. This is just fine but by showing some shots of a Tokyo skyscraper hotel heaven only knows what Ms. Coppola wished to convey. May be she wanted to depict that as people live in high buildings their feelings,emotions become low. A word about the bewildered American in Japan oh no Tokyo. Bill Murray looks utterly lost as if he has not been paid his salary for playing the part in the film. Scarlett is fine but she could have done better. The worst thing about this film is that Japanese people were caricatured. It is as if all the Japanese people use very long sentences even for expressing simplest of ideas. For all those lost souls interested in Japan bashing, please watch Alain Corneau's film \\\"Stupeur et tremblements\\\".\", \"Wow. Kind of a 'cute' movie, riding on that independent film vibe of the individual's search of meaning in life, struggling mightily against an ignorant and heavily cynical world. Sounds like a downer? Never fear, this movie spends 85 percent of the time making fun of japanese people.  If these were scathing attacks, perhaps this movie could almost pass as parody, making fun of stereotypes by overkill is quite effective. Except these were literally, 'let's make fun of the Japanese as bizarre little benign aliens who want to become like us.' This is about two white people trying to have fun in an alien land, shaking their heads at the ridiculous customs of these funny little people, marvelling at how the Japanese could be so different from our own sensible caucasian perspectives. There is no japanese character in this movie who is not grossly caricaturized. Also, whenever Sofia Coppola directed a long lull in the film, hey, insert reocurring joke about height/accents/culture and make the audience laugh, again! There is no such thing as a tired joke in this movie, some jokes are methodically inserted every 15 minutes.  Actually, it's really worthwhile to watch Sofia Coppola deftly direct the profoundly subtle relationship between a 21-year-old yale philosophy major and a washed-up 55-year-old actor. Sure...they both...don't like their lives, do like to drink at the bar, eat food (hey at least no more jokes about monkey brains, huh? good thing this wasn't a korean movie), crack jokes about the japanese! The movie should have the tagline, \\\"How any two white people, no matter how different in age and personality could become soulmates once thrust into this horrible technologically advanced but spiritually backwards world.\\\" Or \\\"Peter Pan and Wendy in Captain Hook's Oriental Nevernevernightmare.\\\" This movie can be metaphorically summarized by how any two people can fall in love on a deserted island, a deserted island full of poisonous snakes, fetid water, quicksand, and erupting volcanoes.  I challenge anybody in the world,including any type of funny little aliens, to logically prove that the particular setting of Japan was necessary to the plot of the movie. Would the relationship between Bill M. and Scarlett J. be any different, if say, it took place in manhattan? Absolutely not, but we wouldn't have the 'comedy' aspect of the movie. And what makes it comedic? Are you laughing at comedy, or are you laughing at the Japanese, these common, stereotypical jokes? I challenge somebody to find any shot in this movie of a japanese person (or perhaps apes in japanese costumes) who isn't acting silly or over the top, as part of a joke, a joke in which the japanese are the being punched by the line.\", \"Lets go to japan and hang around in different parts of the hotel.  Then lets go out to the street and see, \\\"whoa, this is different from America\\\"!  People don't talk English! Signs are not in English! People sing karaoke!

I don't know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker. There were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished, but nothing was brought to ripen.

Highly derivative of much better material (Altman's \\\"Nashville,\\\" Lumet's \\\"Network\\\"), this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere. A couple of misguided detours along the way (an embarrassing musical interlude, a biblical plague) don't help matters. Neither does the uneven level of performances. Especially bad: William H. Macy, whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether; Julianne Moore, for her unconvincing angst. And how many times must we see John C. Reilly's Sad Sack shtick (\\\"Chicago\\\" and \\\"The Hours\\\" will suffice)? Tom Cruise comes off well by comparison \\u0096 his misogynist, foul-mouthed Holy Roller was rather amusing. Speaking of foul mouths, the script was so loaded with \\\"F\\\" bombs, they lost their impact in no time. Don't even talk about that awful soundtrack, full of insipid and annoying vocals by Aimee Mann. Her extended rendition of \\\"One,\\\" a maudlin number to begin with, drove me to distraction at the start of the film. I should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours, by which time I'd been pushed to the brink of hell. One redeeming feature, which I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews, is the best performance in the bunch, by unknown Melora Walters in the role of Claudia, the damaged coke fiend bent on self-destruction. Her credibility exceeded all others by far. This film took itself way too seriously and just didn't know when to end.\", \"That's not just my considered verdict on this film, but also on the bulk of what has been written about it. Now don't get me wrong here either, I'm not a total philistine, I didn't hate the movie because it wasn't enough like 'police academy 9' or whatever, I enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff, I swear.  'Magnolia' is poor, and I am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed. Long winded, self indulgent, rambling nonsense from start to finish, there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie. There's some high calibre actors fair enough, and none turns in an average or worse performance. Furthermore, my wife (a self confessed Tom Cruise hater) tells me it's his career best performance by far. But the plot is so completely unengaging, meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail's pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something.  It doesn't help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with (well I didn't think so, but I don't like most people admittedly). They all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length, demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever-so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack's dire as well, with that marrow-suckingly irritating quality that I had hitherto thought unique to the music of Alanis Morisette.  All in all, it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of 'Friends' whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat. The bit with the frogs is good though.\", \"Magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming, shrieking, overwrought, hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret, guilt and pain. PT Anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess.  A look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent, and they were. I just wish that every scene didn't involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused.  I also think that Anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film. The opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at. But the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display. I kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself, but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution. Throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of Anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the Old Testament.  I will say that the music by Aimee Mann was great and I'll be looking for the Soundtrack CD.

Its full of self-indulgence and loaded with bad acting. I always like to stay and watch the credits, but when this thing was over I couldn't get out of the movie theatre fast enough.

Its also not that I dont like films which, as most people who like it will claim 'observe life'. I love Eat Drink Man Woman, and all that happens in that is that a load of Taiwanese people lead their lives. But I could relate to them. I have never met anyone who swore as much as the 'actors' in this film, and I used to work on a construction site. So go figure. Having said that William H. Macy made me grin. Once.   2/10. Avoid, unless you enjoy tedium.\", \"I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives/stories that come together at the end but Magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and I was lost. I almost turned it off right then and there but I felt I should hang in there until the end, little did I know it would be another torturous 1 1/2 hours. Thank god I rented instead of seeing it in the theatre. I almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene. My DVD player still hasn't forgiven me and I don't blame it one bit. It was a unique movie, but a bad, boring, and pointless movie.\", \"Sorry did i miss something? did i walk out early? The first ten minutes of unusual (and untrue!) stories had me thinking \\\"This is going to be a classic\\\" But it was all down hill from there! The acting was brilliant, for what it's worth William H Macy is fantastic and just gets better and better every film i watch him in. But it never seemed to connect. I was waiting for the big moment where all the stories inter connect and then suddenly..it rains frog?? it was if the writer said \\\"i've gone to deep how can i pull all these stories together cleverely....Oh sod it i'll just have it raining frogs\\\". I like clever movies, i like strange movies but this was just odd and boring. 4/10\", \"Great cast. Great acting. Unpredictable story line for the first half  hour or so. I was really wanting to know what was going to  happen to each of these unredeeming characters, and how their  seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined. But when  the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players, they  mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstill  for the last two hours. I kept thinking it would get better, but it only  got worse. Don't believe the reviews. This is a waste of time.   Think about it -- Tom Cruise made ugly -- why? The gorgeous  hunky bartender wearing braces -- why? I know it had to do with  the plot, but without them, at least there would have been one  attractive cast member to remember.\", \"\\\"Magnolia\\\" is a preposterous, bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little. Like \\\"Eyes Wide Shut,\\\" \\\"Magnolia\\\" is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence. The camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of sad characters. Where is the reason to care for these people? The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot, who can't care for others (except for John C. Reilly's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters), and are self-destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying. I was reminded of how much I disliked \\\"Shine\\\" because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unappealing characters here, why would we want to spend time with them?  Having said that, there is nothing held back about \\\"Magnolia.\\\" Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon. There are two ideas in particular that bomb. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film. One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Mann's coffeehouse folk songs. Sweet, but ineffectual since we can't see what strings them all together. The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous.  \\\"Magnolia\\\" has a lot of great acting. Particularly Tom Cruise who unleashes a performance I didn't know he had in him. And John C. Reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory. But it all adds up to nothing. When the secret unexpected event happened, a girl behind me in the theatre couldn't hold it in any more and said, \\\"This is stupid!\\\" My feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree.\", \"I can't tell you how angry I was after seing this movie. The characters are not the slightest bit interesting, and the plot is non-existant. So after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other, hoping that the past 2 and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish, what do we get??? A storm of frogs. Now yes, I understand the references to the bible (Exodus) and the underlying theme, but first of all, it was presented with absolutely no resolution, and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible (a significant portion of the population) or Charles Fort (a still larger portion). As a somewhat well read person, I thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode.  Don't waste your time. It would be better spent reading...  ...well anything to be honest\", \"The minute you give an 'art film' 1/10, you have people baying for your ignorant, half-ass-ed, artistically retarded blood. I won't try and justify how I am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the 'art house cinema' I have liked or mentioning how I gave some unknown 'cult classic' a 10/10. All I ask is that someone explain to me the point, purpose and message of this film.  Here is how I would summarize the film: Opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co-incidence. This followed by (in a nutshell, to save you 3 hours of pain) the following - A children's game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke-addicted daughter, who he may or may not have raped when she was a child, and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues, while the game-show's star contestant decides that he doesn't want to be a failed child prodigy, a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the 60s, who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for 'corrective oral surgery', while the game show's producer, himself dying of lung cancer, asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago, and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru, even as Mr. Producer's second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man; and oh, eventually, it rains frogs (You read correctly). And I am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless, literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than, possibly, to make sure the film crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a 'modern epic'.   You are probably thinking that I could have done a better job of summarizing the movie (and in turn of not confusing you) if I had written the damn thing a little more coherently, maybe in a few sentences instead of just one...

Although the academy award winning cinematographer is well known. The look of the picture was very flat with no depth or color. Shot digital only no film was used. I had the feeling I was watching a video game. Overall Li Gong tried hard with her acting part in the movie.

I got bored, and kept wondering why the editing was so bad. There was no smooth segway between scenes, it was like *poof* we are here *poof* now here. Ugh The dialog also made no sense for most of it. I don't mean to knock what must have taken forever to make, but jeez. I guess I just hope they don't make a second one. I usually like the actors that were in this. In this case tho...not so much. I also asked people who had also left before it was over what they thought, and they agreed with me. When I walked out there were five other people in the lobby just shaking their heads. Too bad Miami Vice can't do a \\\"do-over\\\"\", \"Boy oh boy this movie disappointed me a lot. Let me go over the cons which are a lot. The movie and the story is way to slow with barely any action involved and this is under the action section? The acting IMO wasn't that good at all and i like Colin Farrell. Pretty much the main stuff that makes this a bad movie is that it's too slow and the story is as well and doesn't make sense at all. It's it jumped from another area to the area with no detail explanation on the drugs other than the ending which is probably my favorite part but still that is not enough. So if i were you i would avoid this movie at all costs, even on free rental day. The only pro is the ending but that's it.\", \"I've had a bad night.Firstly Brick and then Miami Vice.My daughter told me Vice was rubbish i usually follow her advice but i was a fan of the TV shows and Michael Mann is one of my favourite directors so i watched it.She was right this time,but not always,she did recommend Brick but thats another post. Question: who was the mole in the FBI?,where was the rest of the story,where's sonny's alligator Superfluous love scenes,villains that can't shoot eg:all those dead bad guys and one wounded cop when they do the exchange at the finale.Plus points:it looked glossy and Jamie Foxx nailed Tubbs . Why do the bad guys always fall for the pizza delivery trick?,do they not watch TV or movies\", \"I will confess to being bored by this film. So much so that I am amazed that I actually made it to the end. There was nothing there to maintain my interest. Colin Farrell was totally wooden, as was Jamie Foxx. The settings were beautiful, but every internal scene seemed to have been filmed in semi-darkness.At least the actors didn't fall into that awful American habit of inserting what sounds like 'full stop' every 3 or 3 words, but dialogue was still slurred and on occasions difficult to discern. Thank goodness for subtitles on DVD! The entire content of the film was just about enough for a 40 minute TV episode, but alas the film lacked the humour and self-deprecation of the original TV series. This isn't quite the worst film I've watched in the last 12 months, but it's pretty close. In summary : Style over substance.\", \"When I first watched series \\\"Miami Vice\\\", with Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, I was very happy because that was a hell of a show.The plot was good,actors was fine and of course Miami was here. After big success of that TV-series some people decided to make a movie. Movie was made, but that movie isn't that good.In the movie \\\"Miami Vice\\\" we've got lots of famous people,like director Michael Mann,actors Colin Ferrell,Jamie Foxx,Naomie Harris and lots more.Producers succeeded to hire big shot stars on this movie so they can replace actors from series.But they couldn't.Script of the movie is not that bad and we all know what Michael Mann is capable to do but it didn't work with this film.First of all this movie is too long.It is so long that I almost fall asleep in the cinema.Second,actors like Collin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are good actors but they cannot pull this one on their back.Collin Farrell is trying to be different from Don Johnson but he just can't do it.Don Johnson is so much better then Farrell in this role.Jamie Foxx played well,although I don't like him as an actor.And also I have to say that these two actors are good choice but why did they made this movie?To bring them money.There are lots of locations but why do they call it \\\"Miami Vice\\\" when the plot is not set in Miami.They could call it \\\"World Vice\\\" instead.I didn't enjoyed in this movie,but maybe my expectations where too big.I like Mann's camera and he really knows his job.The things I didn't liked where some scenes where Ferrell could do a better job and I also don't know why is this movie so long.It gets boring toward the end.Even though this movie has lot of famous people, it hasn't got some thing so I can say that movie is fine.It lacks of magic.\", \"the movie was bad, couldn't understand half the words, movie was too long and contained random inappropriate scenes in an attempt to recapture the viewers attention.  there was fast cars, high class but, there were never really used , only 2 shooting scenes, and 1 car scene.This movie was a waste of money and time, i will like to see how much profit is made!  also, if you do decided to go to this movie, it would be wise to take a book with you ,as you will get bored.   The characters as well, need to speak more clearly.  .\", \"After reading a few reviews on some well known film sites i thought this was going to be great...but the totally opposite was true. What a huge disappointment. The plot was going from one place to another and at times just gave you one big headache. Poor red herrings and over the top sub plots were shown to us as believable (I think not!). The film was just one sub plot over another and a zig zag of labyrinthian proportions of where the film should be going. And how about this for corny dialogue...'probability is like gravity...'? er..yeah, like dog crap and cheese are identicial???  It seems Michael Mann is a one (HEAT) hit wonder, and simply adding a 10 minute gunfight lifted straight out of HEAT at the end of the movie is not going to save it.  If you want to watch a decent cop thriller check out the little known 'Dirty' a superior film by a lesser known director.  Avoid this Miami VICE and buy the TV series instead.\", \"Saw it tonight; my take:  Casting: About the best I have seen of Ferrell since Minority Report. I was actually amazed that they made him look a lot like a young Don Johnson.   Barry Henley for Castillo though\\u0085. God he sucked. The Lt I loved was 1/2 Ninja and 100% cold bad ass good guy of few words. And when he spoke, you would have thought God was talking. Sadly, this Castillo was in too tight a shirt and was about to choke half the time. How did he get cast for that part? Mann MUST have lost a bet.  Elizabeth Rodriguez as Gina had the best scene in the whole movie, when she shot the Nazi. And it lasted 10 seconds and she was the baddest character in the show. Too bad it was only 10 seconds... my hopes raised but got dashed. The movie never got back to that high point.  Foxx\\u0085 err\\u0085 I still cant get past his Living Color days to take him seriously. And there was next to no chemistry between him and Ferrell. I kept expecting him to tell a joke.  Setting: It was said before, the was not Miami Vice, this was \\\"-anywhere- Vice\\\" The movie could have been set in LA, NYC or heck, Cairo!  Presentation: Where was the great epic gun fight we came to love in Heat? It was too dark and I had not a clue what was going on. I mean Switek is in the middle of the bad guys and they barely even notice him when the shooting starts. Then in the middle he just sort of vanishes?? What gives?? Bad editing and bad filming. And where was Sonny's Brenn 10?!?!?  All and all I blame the Mann. I give it 2 out of 10 stars. Mostly because I have so loved MM in the past that this destruction of a beloved memory by bad acting, bad casting, and non existent direction really hurts. Mann had a sure fire block buster and he will doubtless make some money but as for me I want my $10 back.

What is interesting to me is how when MIDNIGHT COWBOY came out in 1969, it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated X. Of course, at that time X meant Maturity. Since I was only two years old at the time of the movie's release, it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then. However, when I try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film, which included prostitution (the title itself was slang for a male prostitute); homosexuality; loneliness; physical (and to some extent emotional as well) abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day, I can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release. It is worth noting that in the 1970's, MIDNIGHT COWBOY was downgraded to an R rating and even though it is still rated R, some of the scenes could almost be rated PG-13 by today's standards.  I want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie. Jon Voight plays a young man named Joe Buck from Texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in New York City escorting rich women. He emulates cowboy actors like Roy Rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women. After being rejected by all the women he has come across, he meets a sleazy con-man named Enrico \\\"Ratso\\\" Rizzo who is played by Dustin Hoffman. Ratso convinces Joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager. Once again, Joe is conned and before long is homeless. However, Joe comes across Ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment. Without giving away much more of the plot, I want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with Joe and Ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams. I.E. Joe making it as a gigolo and Ratso going down to Florida where he thinks he can regain his health.  I want to make some comments about the movie itself. First of all, the acting is excellent, especially the leads. Although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end, there are some classic scenes. In fact, there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny, I find them amusing. For example, there is the classic scene where Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over. Dustin Hoffman bangs on the cab and says \\\"Hey, I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!\\\" I get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of New York City where so many people are in a hurry. Another scene that comes to mind is the scene where Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) sends Joe (Jon Voight) to a guy named O'Daniel. What is amusing is that at first, we think O'Daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why Joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that O'Daniel is nothing but a religious nut. In addition to the two scenes I mentioned, I love the scene where Ratso and Joe are arguing in their apartment when Ratso says to Joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and Joe says in self-defense \\\"John Wayne! You gonna tell me he's a fag!\\\" What I like is the delivery in that scene.  I would say that even though MIDNIGHT COWBOY was set in the late '60's, much of it rings true today. That's because although the area around 42nd Street in New York has been cleaned up in the form of Disneyfication in the last several years, homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago. Also, many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the Jon Voight character. One thing that impresses me about Jon Voight's character is how he is a survivor and I felt that at the end of the movie, he had matured a great deal and that Ratso (Dustin Hoffman's character) was a good influence on him.  In conclusion, I want to say that I suggest that when watching this movie, one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on. For example, there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings. Also, what I find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with Joe Buck (Jon Voight's character) and the people who were in his life in Texas. Even the ending, while I don't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie, is rather open-ended.\", \"First I would like to say how great this. It is astounding and sometimes shocking. And to say the least I'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely stand a boring film, but this is anything but boring. It is like a trip through humanity. Its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece. It is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers (VOIGHT AND Hoffman) who build a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) a naive Texan stud comes to New York to make it rich by entertaining women. Soon he meets Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent. Ratso becomes Joe's 'manager' but soon both men can't find Joe a job which results in stealing food. As they try and survive on the streets of New York we realize how tough it is. They can't get Joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party. Joe makes some money and soon Joe takes Ratso on a Ratso's dream spot, Florida. The final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film. From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life.\", \"I didn't at all think of it this way, but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title \\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\" was a gay porno. At that point, all I had known of it was the reference made to it in that \\\"Seinfeld\\\" episode with Jerry trying to get Kramer to Florida on that bus and Kramer's all sick and with a nosebleed.  The movie was great, and surprisingly upbeat and not all pissy pretentious pessimistic like some movies I can't even remember because they're all crap.  The plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy Joe Buck going to New York trying to be a hustler (a male prostitute, basically), thinking it'll be easy pickings, only to hit the brick wall hard when a woman ends up hustling HIM, charging him for their sexual encounter.  Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, called \\\"Ratso\\\" by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time. You think of him as a scoundrel, but a lovable one (like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian) and surprisingly he and Joe become friends, and the movie is so sweet and heartwarming watching them being friendlier and such and such. Rizzo reveals himself to actually be a sad, pitiable man who's very sick, and very depressed and self-conscious, hates being called \\\"Ratso\\\" and wants to go to Florida, where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems resolved, and he'll learn to be a cook and be famous there.  It's heartwarming watching Joe do all that he does to get them both down to Florida, along with many hilarious moments (like Ratso trying to steal food at that hippie party, and getting caught by the woman who says \\\"Gee, well, you know, it's free. You don't have to steal it.\\\" and he says \\\"Well if it's free then I ain't stealin' it\\\", and that classic moment completely unscripted and unscheduled where Hoffman almost gets hit by that Taxi, and screams \\\"Hey, I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!\\\"), and the acting is so believable, you'd never believe Joe Buck would grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor Jon Voight, and Ratso Rizzo would grow up to be the legendary and beloved Dustin Hoffman. It's not the first time they've worked together in lead roles, but the chemistry is so thick and intense.  Then there's the sad part that I believe is quite an overstatement to call it \\\"depressing\\\". Ratso Rizzo is falling apart all throughout the movie, can barely walk, barely eat, coughs a lot, is sick, and reaches a head-point on the bus on its way to Florida. He's hurting badly, and only miles away from Miami, he finally dies on the bus. The bus driver reassures everyone that nothing's wrong, and continues on. Sad, but not in the kind of way that'd make you go home and cry and mope around miserably as though you've just lost your dog of 13 years.  All in all, great movie. And the soundtrack pretty much consists just of \\\"Everybody's Talking'\\\" played all throughout the movie at appropriate times. An odd move, but a great one, as the song is good and fits in with the tone of the movie perfectly. Go see it, it's great, go buy it\", \"Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman, is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies. As a portrayal of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day doesn't give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso.   It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels.   Voight's Buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether, except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches him, a lot about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live.  Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself. I think that, as gritty a movie as it is, it has a very beautiful message, that no matter how much a loser you might be (Ratso clearly defines \\\"loser\\\"), if you can find a way to be true to yourself, you are in possession of the secret of life, and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else.   I can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, from a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape.\", \"I was going through a list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for best picture in 1969. After actually seeing it, however, I'm not surprised anymore. It was way ahead of its time in regards to its style, cinematography, and use of flashback to help develop Joe Buck's character.  The most amazing thing to me is the depth of Joe Buck's character in such a short movie. I think Voight captured the naivete and the viciousness-when-provoked. The two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him. I think when he looks in the mirror he's trying to see if it's really him that has done- or is about to do- something terrible.  I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take this role. Otherwise he may have been typecast after the Graduate. Anyway, this considered an all-time great for a reason.\", \"Jon Voight plays a man named Joe. Joe is shook up by a haunting childhood. He has a strong fear and hatred of religion due to his traumatic baptism. He quits his job as a dishwasher and goes out to become a hustler for wealthy people. He meets a misfit named Ratso(Dustin Hoffman) and the two for a relationship. They go out and work together in helping each other out. They become thieves. The two grow remarkably close and soon can't live without each other. However, there is something very important that Ratso hasn't told Joe, and it could destroy any hope they have of surviving the city together. This is one of the greatest films ever made. It is a heartbreaking and shattering portrait of too very lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other. Their story is devastating to watch, but is ultimately important for people to see. It's one of those films where the characters are pretty much just like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes find on the street. The difference is that this film is from their perspective. Their lives are shown to us and it's devastating to see the pedestrians in this film treat them like dirt, especially if we at one time were one of those people. However, the film doesn't try to guilt trip you. Instead, it shows you the rough side of the lifestyle of hustling. It is not a pleasant and easygoing lifestyle like many Hollywood films portray it such as MILK MONEY and PRETTY WOMAN. The lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty, gritty, and ugly life and it's sad that people have degraded themselves like the character of Joe in this film does. What startles me the most about this film was that it came out in 1969, and it has stood the test of time perfectly. Today's audiences will still find great meaning in this film and will still love it and cherish it just as much as critics and audiences did everywhere in 1969. The film was rated X, but what I notice about this film is that the sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest, realistic, and effective way. Anybody who has had sex before will know how humorous, awkward, and scary as hell it can be and this film doesn't shy away from any of that. The sex in this film may not be as graphic as in once was thought to be. Movies that were X rated such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, GREETINGS, LAST TANGO IN Paris, and FRITZ THE CAT all seem remarkably tame compared to the shocking things that people can get away with an R rating today. The sex scenes in MIDNIGHT COWBOY will seem quite strong but they certainly aren't sexy. They are not graphic, but they are realistic, and that's what people should keep in mind when they view this film. The course language that is used in the film, particularly the word \\\"fag\\\" is used effectively and is not gratuitous. The violence is very shocking to watch even today, but again it is necessary to the plot to depict the world of a hustler. I'm really glad to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not dated and is still just as affecting as it was in 1969, if not more. I can't recommend this classic enough and I do hope that it continues to find an audience because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten.  PROS:   -Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both harrowing and amazing to watch. They have never played roles like this before or since and they are completely different from usual. You'll forget who is playing them within minutes!   -Beautiful score   -Not at all dated or campy like many films of that decade come off as today   -Fantastic and fast editing job  CONS:   -For mature audiences only   -The opening scenes are well done, but they could be just a little stronger.\", \"Although I love this movie, I can barely watch it, it is so real. So, I put it on tonight and hid behind my bank of computers. I remembered it vividly, but just wanted to see if I could find something I hadn't seen before........I didn't: that's because it's so real to me.  Another \\\"user\\\" wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary. I'm all for that ! It's absolutely obvious that most of these people who've made comments about \\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\" may not have been born when it was released. They are mentioning other movies Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman have appeared in, at a later time. I'll be just as ruinously frank: I am 82-years-old. If you're familiar with some of my other comments, you'll be aware that I was a professional female-impersonator for 60 of those years, and also have appeared in film - you'd never recognize me, even if you were familiar with my night-club persona. Do you think I know a lot about the characters in this film ? YOU BET I DO !!....  ....and am not the least bit ashamed. If you haven't run-into some of them, it's your loss - but, there's a huge chance you have, but just didn't know it. So many moms, dads, sons and daughters could surprise you. It should be no secret MANY actors/actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of \\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\". Who is to judge ? I can name several, current BIG-TIME stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities, and weren't the least bit damaged by their time spent there. I make no judgment, because these are humans, just as we all are - love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility: you name the attributes, they are all there, no matter what the package looks like.  The \\\"trivia\\\" about Hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of \\\"Ratzo\\\" is a gem - he can be seen driving his auto all around Los Angeles - how do you think he gets his input? I can also name lots of male-stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money. Although the nightclub I last worked in for 26 years was world-famous and legit, I can also name some HUGE stars that had to be constantly chased out our back-street, looking to make a pick-up.  This should be no surprise today, although it's definitely action in Hollywood and other cities, large and small. Wake-up and smell the roses. They smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue.  Some of the \\\"users\\\" thought \\\"Joe Buck\\\" had been molested by his grandma. Although I saw him in her bed with a boyfriend, I didn't find any incidence of that. Believe-it-or-not, kids haven't ALWAYS had their own rooms - because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going-on in the master-bedroom. Whose business? Hoffman may have begged for change on the streets, but some of the \\\"users\\\" point-out that Jon Voight was not a major star for the filming of \\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\" - his actual salary would surprise you. I think he was robbed ! No one can doubt the clarity he put into his role, nor that it MADE him a star for such great work as \\\"Deliverance\\\". He defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it: few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie. The end of the 60s may have been one of the first films to be so open, but society has always been hip.  I also did not find any homosexuality between \\\"Ratzo\\\" and \\\"Joe\\\" - they were clearly opposites, unappealing to one another. They found a much purely higher relationship - true friendship. If you didn't understand that at the end of the movie, then you've wasted your time. \\\"Joe's\\\" bewilderment, but unashamed devotion was apparent. Yes, Voight deserved an Oscar for this role - one that John Wayne could never pull-off, and he was as handsome in his youth.  Hoffman is Hoffman - you expect fireworks. He gave them superbly. Wayne got his Oscar. Every character in this film was beautifully defined - if you don't think they are still around, you are mistaken. \\\"The party\\\" ? - attend some of the \\\"raves\\\" younger people attend.....if you can get in. Look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs - you'll see every outrageous personality.  Brenda Viccaro was the epitome of society's sleek women who have to get down to the nitty-gritty at times. If you were shocked by her brilliant acting, thinking \\\"this isn't real\\\", look at today's \\\"ladies\\\" who live on the brink of disrepute....and are admired for it.  The brutality \\\"Joe\\\" displayed in robbing the old guy, unfortunately, is also a part of life. You don't have to condone it, but it's not too much different than any violence. \\\"Joe\\\" pointedly named his purpose - in that situation, I'd have handed-over the money quicker than he asked for it. That's one of the scenes that makes this movie a break-through, one which I do not watch. I get heartbroken for both.....  John Schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eye-opener- Waldo Salt didn't write from clairvoyance. Anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history, and should be proud for the honesty of it. Perhaps \\\"only in America\\\" can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations, while other movie-makers make no compunction in presenting it to the public. Not looking doesn't mean it isn't there - give me the truth every time. Bravo! to all......\", \"Acidic, unremitting, and beautiful, John Schlesinger's masterpiece is no less effective today than 35 years ago, when American life was even more disorienting. The film probably could not have been made at any other time in history, because so many upheavals were taking place in the late 1960s: final dissolution of the Great American West, the intensification of war in Vietnam, and the clash of social ideals that were bewildering in variety.  'Midnight Cowboy' is widely known as the only Academy Award-winning film to garner an 'X' rating, but there is much more behind its fame; it also exceeds the norm as a work of art. While this film (from the novel by James Leo Herlihy) has much to say about the erosion of American life, it transcends '60s politics by looking into the hidden bonds of friendship and dealing with themes familiar to man in all eras. The two main characters, in fact, are standard antiheroes - men who have nothing grand to offer but plenty to vent about our world.  The initial focus of 'Midnight Cowboy' is on 28-year-old Joe Buck, a physically imposing Texas native played by Jon Voight. In the opening scenes, we follow Joe's bus trip to New York City, where he plans on using one of his few genuine talents - the ability to pleasure women - and earn his fortune as a hustler. We learn upon his arrival that Joe is laughably na\\u00efve in the sex trade. Garbed in cowboy duds and proclaiming himself as 'one hell of a stud,' the young Texan flounders through his early tricks before partnering with Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a sickly con man and petty thief from the Bronx. Ratso, who is short, thin, and with a limp, proves of little monetary help to Joe. They quickly run out of cash and as life grows severe in the winter months, Joe and Ratso shiver in a condemned Manhattan apartment building with hardly a dollar or square meal to their names. It is over this period that a strong friendship develops between them, the two men relying on each other to battle tremendous odds.  Throughout the film, Joe hearkens back to earlier years in Texas, including life with his grandmother Sally (Ruth White), who served as guardian; his harried relationship with 'Crazy' Annie (Jennifer Salt), a notorious local girl; and a traumatic event in which Joe and Annie were assaulted by town folk who wanted to break up the love affair. Very much of its time, 'Midnight Cowboy' strings together a wild array of flashbacks, dream sequences, and psychedelic imagery that shed light on the main characters while also distorting their backgrounds. For every moment of understanding we gain from Joe and Ratso, more questions about their lives are generated. Both men are no doubt in tatters; they have no clear sense of direction until Ratso falls into the throes of illness and Joe finally senses a purpose for being alive. This revelation pushes 'Midnight Cowboy' to its conclusion, a rather hopeful one in a very grim story.  While Joe and Ratso badly need some luck, the direction of John Schlesinger is clearly outlined and uses the gritty atmosphere of Waldo Salt's screenplay in allowing Voight and Hoffman to thrive. Their interactions look extremely natural and the supporting cast, which features Sylvia Miles, Brenda Vaccaro, and members of the Andy Warhol clique, offers itself as an essential part of the storyline. The flashback sequences involving Voight, Ruth White, and Jennifer Salt are particularly impressive in dealing with the heartbreak of time lost.  Any young person wondering about the psychedelic era is advised to watch this film, thanks to the excellent cinematography of Adam Holender ('The Boy Who Could Fly,' 'Smoke') and editing by Hugh Robertson ('Shaft'). The visuals of 'Midnight Cowboy' work with its soundtrack (assembled by John Barry) as a cohesive unit, sometimes foreseeing music videos of the past two decades. The lead song Everybody's Talking is sung by Nilsson, which was actually used as a temporary track during the editing phase. The memorable harmonica theme is played by Jean 'Toots' Thielemans.  'Midnight Cowboy' has been released in a two-disc collector's edition by MGM/UA, which contains expanded features and commentary. Also available is a 1998 DVD release (used for this review), which offers dual widescreen and standard format with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound enhancement; three-language subtitles and closed captioning; French 'dubbing'; a theatrical re-release trailer (not the 'original' as advertised); and an eight-page production booklet. Both DVD editions contain a 25th anniversary restored version of the film, showing its original brilliance. Well-deserving of its three Oscars (best picture, Schlesinger, Waldo Salt) and additional nominations (Voight, Hoffman, Sylvia Miles, Hugh Robertson), 'Midnight Cowboy' will be sure to hold its place on the list of immortal classics.  *** \\u00bd out of 4\", \"What makes Midnight Cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which Joe Buck becomes bonded to Ratso Rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both. There really aren't many glimpses of hope in this film for either character, but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other.  This film features Jon Voight's finest performance and probably Dustin Hoffman's as well. The rest of the cast is made up of unknowns, though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors, including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film. Also, for those interested, Andy Warhol's apprentice Paul Morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene.  If you haven't seen this movie, it is essential. Check it out.\", \"\\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\" is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason - it really is one of the finest films ever made in America. Its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial. No wonder it was a huge success when initially released. But be warned, its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made. The characters are memorable, well-developed, and ultimately tragic. The filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the Hollywood ending, something which was basically mandatory by the 80s. Still, this is why I treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for American film. Its a time when well-made, innovative, and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that Hollywood could offer. All this was over by the time \\\"Star Wars\\\" was released.  The direction by John Schlesinger makes the material work. It combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing. Unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects, \\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\" has aged quite well. Its still as powerful now as it was when initially released. The acting however is what makes this a masterpiece. The characters' backgrounds are never fully explained, but the performances make them completely developed. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic (despite their sometimes reprehensible actions). Plus, being a fan of vintage exploitation films, I loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy 42nd street. \\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\" is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made. (10/10)\", \"Midnight Cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969, drawing an X rating. By today's standards, it would be hard pressed to pull an R rating. Jon Voight, who has been better, is competent in his role as Joe Buck, an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in New York City. He meets a seedy street hustler named Ratso Rizzo, who tries to befriend Buck for his own purposes. The two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic. As Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman has often been brilliant, but never more so than in this portrayal. He is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison. Losing the Academy Award to John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Director Schlessinger has a deft hand with his production, but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. Worth seeing for Hoffman's performance alone.\", \"Midnight Cowboy is not for everybody. It's raw, painful, and realistic but very entertaining. The lead actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman who would go on to become Oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances. Voight as the Texas hustler, Joe Buck, who migrates from small town Texas to New York City to become a hustler. He does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy. The New York City women like the rich lady played by Georgeann Johnson and Cass played by Oscar nominated Sylvia Miles are different than Texas women. Sadly, Buck is trying to escape from his past life in Texas. He was raised by his grandmother, Sally Buck, played by the wonderful actress Ruth White who died in 1969 from cancer. The locations in New York City are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between Fatso played by Hoffman and Buck's characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship. The men are struggling to survive the New York City life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job. As the film evolves, Buck's past comes to the surface and it's haunting but not clear. The film is not for children but compared to today's films and television programming, Midnight Cowboy might be more tame. I can't forget a young Brenda Vaccaro and a party that you can't forget. It's also a tearjerker of a film, so get your hankies out too.\", \"Hardly the stuff dreams are made of is this pursuit of the brass ring by a naive hustler (JON VOIGT) and his lame con-man sidekick (DUSTIN Hoffman), soon to forge a friendship based on basic survival skills.  A daring film for its time, and a foremost example of the kind of gritty landscape being explored in the more graphic films of the '60s. Symbolic of the \\\"end of innocence\\\" in American films, since it was the only X-rated film to win a Best Picture Oscar.  JON VOIGT is the male hustler who comes to the big city expecting to find women an easy way to make money when they fight over his body, but soon finds the city is a cold place with no welcome mat for his ilk. Befriended by a lame con-man (DUSTIN Hoffman), he goes through a series of serio-comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter, ready to leave the confines of a cold water flat for the sunshine promised in Florida, a land his friend \\\"Ratzo\\\" dreams of living in.  But even in this final quest, the two are losers. John Schlesinger has directed with finesse from a brilliant script by Waldo Salt, and John Barry's haunting \\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\" theme adds to the poignant moments of search and desperation.  Summing up: A true American classic honestly facing a tough subject and daring to show the underbelly of certain aspects of city life.\", \"John Schlesinger's 'Midnight Cowboy' is perhaps most notable for being the only X-rated film in Academy history to receive the Oscar for Best Picture. This was certainly how I first came to hear of it, and, to be completely honest, I didn't really expect much of the film. This is not to say that I thought it would be horrible, but somehow I didn't consider it the sort of movie that I would enjoy watching. This is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners \\u0096 a remarkable combination of stellar acting, ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack (\\\"Everybody's talking' at me, I don't hear a word they're sayin'\\\") make this film one of the finest explorations of life, naivety and friendship ever released.  Young Joe Buck (then-newcomer Jon Voight), dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy, travels from Texas to New York to seek a new life as a hustler, a male prostitute. Women, however, do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services, and Joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up. During these exploits, Joe comes to meet Enrico \\\"Ratso\\\" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con Joe out of all his money. When they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament, Ratso offers Joe a place to stay, and, working together, they attempt to make (largely dishonest) lives for themselves in the cold, gritty metropolis of New York.  Joe had convinced himself that New York women would be more than willing to pay for sex; however, his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman (Sylvia Miles) twenty dollars. Though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent, Ratso is just as na\\u00efve as Joe. Ratso, with his painful limp and hacking cough, is always assuring himself that, if only he could travel to the warmth of Miami, somehow everything would be all right. This misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of Lennie and George of John Steinbeck's classic novel, 'Of Mice and Men.'  Shot largely on the streets of New York, 'Midnight Cowboy' is a grittily-realistic look at life in the slums. Watching the film, we can almost feel ourselves inside Ratso's squalid, unheated residence, our joints stiff from the aching winter cold. The acting certainly contributes to this ultra-realism, with both Voight and Hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society. Hoffman, in particular, is exceptional in his role (I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!\\\"), managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his much-lauded debut in 1967's 'The Graduate.' Both stars were later nominated for Best Actor Oscars (also nominated for acting \\u0096 bafflingly \\u0096 was Sylvia Miles, for an appearance that can't have been for more than five minutes), though both ultimately lost out to John Wayne in 'True Grit.' 'Midnight Cowboy' eventually went on to win three Oscars from seven nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director for Schlesinger and Best Writing for Waldo Salt.  'Midnight Cowboy' is told mainly in a linear fashion, though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at Joe's past. Rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about, the audience is invited to think about it for themselves, and how these circumstances could have led Joe onto the path he is now pursuing. The achingly-beautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope, but a large amount of uncertainty. Gritty, thought-provoking and intensely fascinating, 'Midnight Cowboy' is one for the ages.\", \"\\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\" was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic. You know it's a classic the moment its insistent theme song, 'Everybody's Talking' starts up on the soundtrack, (actually not written for the film), and the way the camera introduces us to Joe Buck, (naked and in the shower). We had seen Jon Voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he's 'one helluva stud' who's to doubt him? This was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if Voight had never done anything else, his performance here would still be legendary. As it is Voight has seldom disappointed on screen; even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish \\\"Anaconda\\\" is a source of pleasure).  The film became famous and infamous almost overnight. It was a crowd-pleaser, (even with its downbeat ending), funny and sexy and recognizably 'real'; (it was the tail-end of the sixties and all the characters rang true). It was also the first 'X' rated film to win the Oscar as the year's Best Picture. Adapted, (brilliantly), by Waldo Salt from a James Leo Herlihy novel it was probably the first main-stream commercial American movie to deal with 'taboo' subjects such as homosexuality and drug-taking in a matter-of-fact manner. Everyone is recognizably human, warts and all, and everyone is treated sympathetically. Voight's Joe Buck is an innocent abroad, a Candide who comes to New York to seek his fortune as a hustler, (a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy; he's a cross between a gigolo and a social worker). But when he himself is hustled by a scraggy, wormy little con-man called 'Ratso' Rizzo, (Dustin Hoffman, fresh from \\\"The Graduate\\\" and he's a revelation), he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipe-dream.  Essentially it's a male love story, (though totally platonic), between these two not so unlikely bedfellows. Both totally alone, both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other, (Voight with his physical prowess, Hoffman with his street-wise savvy). They are misfits adrift from the mainstream, tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others. Though 'straight' Voight isn't beyond a homosexual encounter in a 42nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself. (The whole film posits a strangely 'Christian' attitude).  It's also magnificently acted. While Voight and Hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of Brenda Vaccaro and Sylvia Miles as well as John McGiver, Bob Balaban and Bernard Hughes as sundry customers and hangers-on, beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while John Schlesinger's direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an alien's totally detached eye-view of the American under-belly without rancor and without criticism. On second thoughts, maybe it is a great movie after all.\", \"Just kidding.  Seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in New York City, Jon Voight is young optimist Cowboy (almost Forest Gump-like) Joe Buck from Texas. It does not take long for the Big Apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon Joe is the target of both the coldness of New Yorkers and cons from its street-thugs. Given his pure heart, he takes pity on one of these thugs, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survive.  While Midnight Comedy is labeled as a drama, it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion. It is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippie-vibe of the late 1960s with its mandatory dizzying Warhol-party cinematography and juxtaposing it with ultra-urban New York City. The film crams Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere in between, thereby emphasizing his out-of-place position. We feel for his struggle to fit in, but also to merely get enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo.  Midnight Cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart. I imagine this film must have inspired both Forest Gump with its pure-hearted and out-of-place lead character and, to an extent, the Crocodile Dundee films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour - a contrast between country-cowboys and slick New York cosmopolitans. Very compelling and sensationally creative film that I highly recommend.  8.5/10\", \"Saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released. Had me snifflin' like a baby as I left the theatre, trying not to let anyone see. So, when I saw it again now in '07, I knew what to expect & the sobs were ready & primed as their required moment approached. Thankfully this time I was at home.  What I hadn't remembered from my youthful viewing- or perhaps hadn't noticed because of it, was the technical brilliance of this movie. The use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue. The camera work which seemed to place the viewer, together with the characters in the scene. Think of the opening when Joe is crossing the street to the diner, the camera pans behind the woman & child sitting on a bench in the foreground, framing the street scene.   The story itself, & the characters - seedy, sad & brutally real. It is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn. Then again, Joe & Ratso could be any of us. Must have been '70 when I saw it. I recall that upon leaving the theatre I was impelled to find the company of friends. All these years later, I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is one hell of a great movie.\", \"Midnight Cowboy opens with a run down Drive In theater with the voice-over of the main character Joe Buck (Jon Voight) singing in the shower. He is singing a cowboy song, the very thing he strives to be. Joe picks up his humdrum life living in Texas and moves it to New York City with the dream of lots of women, and even more money. He dresses as the epitome of the cowboy, but in a cartoonish fashion, not even his friends take him seriously. He begins his journey on the bus to NYC and we can quickly see how diluted Joe is through his interactions with the other passengers. This is primarily a story of Joe's realization of the harsh realities of the real world.  He starts off as a very na\\u00efve southerner thinking he can make it in NYC just on his good looks. He has no other reason to think otherwise, as they proved helpful in the past; we learn this from the many flashbacks he has. In the beginning the flashbacks are filmed in a way that portrays them as being somewhat whimsical. They are hazy and the voices sound as if they are coming from a great distance, as they are, they are coming out of his past. However, as Joe delves deeper and deeper into the reality of the harsh atmosphere of NYC we see more of his past, which is no longer whimsical but gritty, filmed in black and white with rapid editing to portray the cruel nature of the past events. This is especially seen in the flashback of him and his girlfriend being assaulted, and her being raped. In one of these flashbacks we see a building being torn down brick by brick. This mirrors the way in which Joe himself is falling apart; the naivet\\u00e9 that he once carried is falling off of him. He and Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) are living in squalor, and barely able to get food to eat; Joe is realizing he cannot live off of his looks, that there is a gritty underbelly of New York that he didn't envision. His subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning out.  Ratso is also serves as a kind of mirror to Joe, but in an opposite way; Ratso is Joe's foil. Joe is a handsome, strong man who, for the most part, has a good outward appearance. Ratso, on the other hand, from the very first time we see him sitting next to Joe in the bar we can tell he is the opposite. He is short, dark, and always coated with a sheen of sweat. He understands how the world works, that it is unforgiving, and sometimes no matter how hard you try you will fail; just as his father did. They are living in the same world, the same apartment even, but they understand things on a completely different level.  The theme of alienation, one that is common of this era, is very apparent in this film. Neither Joe nor Ratso fit into the culture surrounding them. Joe feels trapped in Texas and moves to NYC where he is still very much an outsider. Ratso, living in the cold of NYC, wishes to move to sunny Florida where he thinks he will be able to find a good life. Even though this is his ideal, in the fantasy we get from Ratso's perspective, it is apparent that he knows he will never really fit into society. In said fantasy he is turned on by the people living around him, he is yet again an outsider, alienated from society.  It is not until the end that the gap between Joe and Ratso begins to narrow. Joe resorts to violence; he takes on the mentality of this city in order to get money to fund a means of escape for Florida for himself and Ratso. On the journey we see Joe coming out of a store not wearing the cowboy clothes that he is never without in the rest of the film. He is dressed as someone who looks like they are headed to Florida for vacation. He dresses Ratso the same way; he tires to make them fit into the new society they are entering, but it is to no avail. Upon Ratso's death on the bus, their fellow passengers once again look them upon as outsiders. Even in this new culture they have entered, they cannot escape the alienation they have met at every turn in this film. Despite the Ratso's death, and Joe's continued alienation, the film ends with the hope that Joe can take his new knowledge of how the world works and create a better life than he would have had as a hustler in NYC. Midnight Cowboy is an excellent film portraying the harsh reality of society, and alienation, with stellar performances by both Voight and Hoffman.\", \"After Racism, Rural exodus -also known as migration from the country side- is another socio-political issue of the 1960s. WestSide Story had dealt with Racism by a love feast in an artistic view. Now, Midnight Cowboy deals with rural exodus by a friendship tragedy in a psychological view. It has a deeply grievous ending that we witness one of the two companions of fate passing away.  Director John Schlesinger skillfully deliver us the deepest secret thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and evaluations of two New York City scums. While the handsome Joe Buck(Voight) dreams of all the beautiful women of the world begging him to share a wild love fantasy, the poor Ratso Rizzo(Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny Florida. Accordingly, Joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality; and Ratso becomes a snatcher to collect enough money to migrate into Florida. Besides Ratso helps Joe to find his way to do whatever he can. They begin sharing everything in life. They share food, they share medicine, they share an uninhabited home, they share their earnings and thus they share a destiny. Regrettably as the story progresses, Joe realizes that being handsome is not the only thing to make all the beautiful women begging him to have fun; and moreover Ratso cannot see Florida since his heart fails defeated to his disease whilst he was on the bus taking him there.  The Might is always right, and the Feeble has no right in the daylight. Thence, \\\"Midnight\\\" gives the factual sight.  Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy. Every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate. Thanks to this, Midnight Cowboy is a provocative view of a socio-political issue, the rural exodus.\", \"Fascinating downer about a would-be male hustler in New York City forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled con-man. Extremely bleak examination of modern-day moral and social decline, extremely well-directed by John Schlesinger (who never topped his work here) and superbly acted by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. Packs quite a punch overall, yet the \\\"fantasy\\\" scenes--some of which are played for a chuckle--are mildly intrusive, as is the \\\"mod\\\" drug party. The relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental, yet the filmmakers are careful not to get mushy, and this gives the picture an edge it might not have had with a lesser director than Schlesinger. Originally X-rated in 1969, and the winner of the Best Picture Oscar; screenwriter Waldo Salt (who adapted James Leo Herilhy's book) and Schlesinger also won statues. ***1/2 from ****\", \"It's not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered, but 1969's \\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\" is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time. Directed by John Schlesinger and written by Waldo Salt, the movie seems to be a product of its time, the late 1960's when American films were especially expressionistic, but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period. The film's cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in Ang Lee's \\\"Brokeback Mountain\\\".  The meandering plot follows Joe Buck, a naive, young Texan who decides to move to Manhattan to become a stud-for-hire for rich women. Full of energy but lacking any savvy, he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances. He meets a cynical, sickly petty thief named \\\"Ratso\\\" Rizzo, who first sees Joe as an easy pawn. The two become dependent on one another, and Rizzo begins to manage Joe. Things come to a head at a psychedelic, drug-infested party where Joe finally lands a paying client. Meanwhile, Rizzo becomes sicker, and the two set off for Florida to seek a better life. This is not a story that will appeal to everyone, in fact, some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures, yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic.  In his first major role, Jon Voight is ideally cast as he brings out Joe's paper-thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities. As Rizzo, Dustin Hoffman successfully upends his clean, post-college image from \\\"The Graduate\\\" and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to Joe. The honesty of their portrayals is complemented by Schlesinger's film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the Times Square district at the time. The director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character's fragile psyches. Credit also needs to go to Salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story. The other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters, including Brenda Vaccaro as the woman Joe meets at the party, Sylvia Miles as a blowsy matron, John McGiver as a religious zealot and Barnard Hughes as a lonely out-of-towner.  The two-disc 2006 DVD package contains a pristine print transfer of the 1994 restoration and informative commentary from producer Jerome Hellman since unfortunately neither Schlesinger nor Salt are still living. There are three terrific featurettes on the second disc - a look-back documentary, \\\"After Midnight: Reflections on a Classic 35 Years Later\\\", which features comments from Hellman, Hoffman, Voight and others, as well as clips and related archive footage such as Voight's screen test; \\\"Controversy and Acclaim\\\", which examines the genesis of the movie's initial 'X' rating and public response to the film; and a tribute to the director, \\\"Celebrating Schlesinger\\\".\", \"'Midnight Cowboy' was rated X with the original release back in 1969. There are some scenes where you can understand that, just a little. The movie about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) coming from Texas to New York City to become a hustler is sometimes a little disturbing. Dressed up as a cowboy he tries to live as a hustler, making money by the act of love. It does not work out as he planned. After a guy named Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) first pulled a trick on him and stole some money they become friends. They live in an empty and very filthy apartment. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe has to try to make some money.  The movie was probably rated X for the main subject but on the way we see some strange things. The editing in this movie is great. We see dream sequences from Joe and Ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and the supporting actors give great performances. Especially Hoffman delivers some fine famous lines. The score is done by John Barry and sounds great. All this makes this a great movie that won the Best Picture Oscar for a good reason.\", \"Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides he's going to leave his small life in Texas and make it big in the Big City. The women are there for the asking and the men are mainly \\\"tutti-fruttis.\\\" Wide-eyed, he comes to New York City, not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences, one worse than the other. In the middle of that chaos, he meets and befriends Rico \\\"Ratso\\\" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann), a homeless-looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building.  There isn't much of a story as MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only Joe Buck's plights in the City, but also inter-cut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semi-psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past: his failed relationship with his girlfriend Annie (Jennifer Salt) who was gang-raped, his abandonment by his mother, and his apparent abuse by his grandmother, who also had a habit of hustling men for money. An air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as Nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery \\\"Everybody's Talking'\\\"; we feel that even while we want Joe to eventually make his mark in the City, the odds are high he won't and will end up working for pennies in a dead-end job -- shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself. We know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this.  A dark story of dashed hopes, John Schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s, and at the center, the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life. There is the implied notion that they may have been lovers -- Ratso's reaching out to hug Joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this -- but this is essentially a buddy film, one that manages to survive, literally, to the death, and bring some form of hope to Joe who at the end in Florida seems much changed, older, wiser.\", \"I sat down to watch \\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\" thinking it would be another overrated '60s/'70s movie. Some of my favorite films come from the '70s, in the same vein as \\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\" (\\\"Taxi Driver,\\\" \\\"Mean Streets,\\\" \\\"Panic in Needle Park,\\\" etc.) but there are many, many overrated ones as well that have gained strong reputations amongst critics for being groundbreaking - unfortunately a vast majority of them don't hold up as well today. I sort of feel this way about \\\"Easy Rider.\\\" (Although it, too, is one of my favorites.)  So, I didn't expect much from \\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\" but got a lot back. It's a touching story, well-made and well-told with some of the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman, as Enrico \\\"Ratso\\\" Rizzo, gives one of his best - it's a bit funny at times (he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks - maybe because of the Lenny/\\\"Simpsons\\\" connection), but Hoffman is entirely convincing. Half of the film's budget went towards his paycheck as he was just becoming a major star in Hollywood. Opposite him is the second-billed Jon Voight as Joe Buck, the \\\"cowboy\\\" who travels North to the Big Apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute. Soon his naive ways land him in trouble and he pairs up with a crippled scam artist named \\\"Ratso\\\" - who offers to become Joe's \\\"manager\\\" for a certain percentage of profits.  The movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long. Some films can tend to drag, especially some of the films that were made in the '70s because (as it's been said in \\\"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls\\\") the directors were the stars of the movies in the 1970s and occasionally they got a bit too infatuated with their material, going on too long examining characters/scenes/etc. that aren't important. Just about the only scene I felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party - it makes the film seem extremely outdated (similar to the drug odysseys in \\\"Easy Rider\\\") and really harms its flow because it's not needed.  Other than that, \\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\" is an almost flawless motion picture. I was pleasantly surprised. It does have its flaws (flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been, for instance) and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy (such as the gay movie theater sequence) but if you can handle its content \\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\" is a truly great motion picture, an uncompromising examination of life on the streets in the late '60s/early '70s. It's a depressing movie, yes, and by today's standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of \\\"life is horrible, etc.\\\"...but I still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long, long time.  Highly recommended. One of the best films of the '70s. (It was technically released in late 1969 but I'd still categorize it as a 1970s film. It also won the Best Picture Oscar, being the first - and only - X-rated motion picture to do so. It was later re-rated R on appeal.)  4.5/5\", \"The only reason I knew of Midnight Cowboy was because it was in the AFI Critic's Top 100. For a top 100 it is not a very well known movie; indeed, I had to look hard to find a copy, I got the DVD version for about half-price. Surprisingly it was only rated M15+ (the uncut version).  I doubt many will take notice of this review (more like comment) so I'll make it brief.  This is perhaps one of the strangest movies I've seen, partly because of the use of montages, artistic filming (very art-house) and the unusual theme. There are many things in the film I still don't understand (I've seen it twice), and it makes for an emotionally confusing film.  The filming and acting were very good, and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable. The main character is Joe Buck, a 'cowboy' from Texas who moves to New York to become a male prostitute. He meets the crippled conman Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo and, of course they become friends going through the usual escapades. What makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different.  I felt the film didn't really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection, although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic. You probably already know what happens by reading the reviews, but its pretty obvious from the start.  I personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes. The deprivation of humanity (shown by the darkness of the city streets, the breaking-down tenements). Most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law (a conman, giggolo.etc) yet you can't help liking them. Joe Buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic, while we begin to feel pity for Ratso later in the film.  I think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very ground-breaking for its period. At the time (And even now) it was definitely not a typical movie (quite art-house). At a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns, musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as Midnight Cowboy pops up.  On a personal level, I must say I quite liked the film. The imagery conveyed a dream-like quality. I particularly liked the scene at the party, the music, images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching. However, as a movie for entertainment's sake it was a bit lacking (not really my style of movie) in thrills. This is a film to be savoured and appreciated, rather than a cheap thrills action flick.  Although I would hardly consider myself qualified to analyse this film, the characters and their motives were quite interesting. From what I understand from the flashbacks, Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother, although it still doesn't seem to be relevant to the story. He is a happy-go-lucky young stud, who suppresses his darker memories. The religious connotations in the film are also puzzling. Some have suggested a homosexual connection between Buck and Ratso, although I fail to see where they have got the idea from. The theme of homo-sexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation, and later in Joe Buck's encounter with a lonely old man, but it has little to do with the main story.  Certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade (it has more of a 70s feel to it than a 60s feel) and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films dared to do. While it has a simple, sentimental story to it (disguised by a hard edge) the beauty of the film is in the strange, often psychedelic sequences.\", \"Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has absolutely stood the test of time, and I have watched it several times since.   Everything about this film is brilliant, from the poignant performances from Voight and Hoffman (even though I know this movie well, I still find myself welling up every time Voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks, or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way) to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences.   It's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren't prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one. Midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools.   10/10\", \"Virile, but naive, big Joe Buck leaves his home in Big Spring, Texas, and hustles off to the Big Apple in search of women and big bucks. In NYC, JB meets up with frustration, and with \\\"Ratso\\\" Rizzo, a scruffy but cordial con artist. Somehow, this mismatched pair manage to survive each other which in turn helps both of them cope with a gritty, sometimes brutal, urban America, en route to a poignant ending.  Both funny and depressing, our \\\"Midnight Cowboy\\\" rides head-on into the vortex of cyclonic cultural change, and thus confirms to 1969 viewers that they, themselves, have been swept away from the 1950's age of innocence, and dropped, Dorothy and Toto like, into the 1960's Age of Aquarius.  The film's direction is masterful; the casting is perfect; the acting is top notch; the script is crisp and cogent; the cinematography is engaging; and the music enhances all of the above. Deservedly, it won the best picture Oscar of 1969, and I would vote it as one of the best films of that cyclonic decade.\", \"In my opinion, this is one of the greatest movies ever made in America and it deserved every single award it won and it's place on the AFI Top 100 list (though it's shamefully too low on the IMDB Top 250 list, at only #183 as of this writing). If you enjoy acting of the highest calibre (Voight and Hoffman are a superb match), well-drawn characterizations and inventive direction, editing and cinematography, you'll love this just as much as I did. Schlesinger paints a vivid, always credible picture of the late 60s New York City scene and it's many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amidst the amorality, poverty and hopelessness of 42nd Street, New York City.  The filmmaking techniques employed here brilliantly capture the feel of the underground New York film movement (and of the city) and are nothing less than dazzling. I've seen many ideas (including the rapid-fire editing, the handling of the voice-over flashbacks, the drug/trip sequences and the cartoonish face slipped in during a murder scene to convey angst and terror) stolen by other filmmakers.  The relationship between Joe and Ratso is handled in such a way as to be viewed as an unusually strong friendship OR having it's homosexual underpinnings. I think the director handled this in a subtle way not to cop out to the censorship of the times, but rather to concentrate his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life, whether it be sexual or not.  MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave, moving film of magnitude, influence and importance that has lost absolutely none of it's impact over the years, so if you haven't seen it, you're really missing out on a true American classic. I recommend this film to everyone.  Score: 10 out of 10.\", \"Young, handsome, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texas to New York thinking he'll make a living by being a stud. He gets there and finds out quickly that it isn't going to be easy--he goes through one degrading experience after another. At the end of his rope he hooks up with crippled, sleazy Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to Florida. But will they make it?  Very dark, disturbing yet fascinating movie. Director John Schelsinger paints a very grimy portrait of NYC and its inhabitants. In that way it's dated--the city may have been this bad in 1969 but it's cleaned up considerably by now. He also uses every camera trick in the book--color turning to black & white; trippy dream sequences; flash forwards; flash backs (especially involving a rape); shock cuts; weird sound effects...you name it. It keeps you disoriented and off center--but I couldn't stop watching.  There isn't much of a story--it basically centers on the friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is an implication that they may have been lovers (the final shot sort of shows that). It's just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold, cruel, urban jungle.  This was originally rated X in 1969--the only reason being that the MPAA didn't think that parents would want their children to see this. Nevertheless, it was a big hit with high schoolers (back then X meant no one under 17). It also has been the only X rated film ever to win an Academy Award as Best Picture. Hoffman and Voight were up for acting awards as was (mysteriously) Sylvia Miles who was in the picture for a total of (maybe) 5 minutes! It was eventually lowered to an R (with no cuts) when it was reissued in 1980.  Also the excellent song \\\"Everybody's Talkin'\\\" was introduced in this film--and became a big hit.  A great film---but very dark. I'm giving it a 10. DON'T see it on commercial TV--it's cut to ribbons and incomprehensible.\", \"For those who like depressing films with sleazy characters and a sordid storyline, this one is for you! From the bleak New York City atmosphere, which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place, to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality, this movie is a real downer.   Why it won the Academy Award was because it was so shocking at that time that Hollywood, brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned, wanted to celebrate that fact. Filmmakers then were like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store. So, Hollywood gave theater viewers (for probably the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealing....and then awarded its work.   It also hoped, I'm sure, to shock mainstream audiences. Well, it succeeded on that level. Audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the Academy, proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time, couldn't help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbage.  Forty years ago, as a very young man, I found this film fascinating, too. However, seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth I never watched to view it again.   The acting was good, but so what? Acting is good in many films. Nobody ever said Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight couldn't act. Hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wacked-out people. He was kind of like the Johnny Depp of his era, playing guys like \\\"Ratso Rizzo\\\" in this film and then going to be the \\\"Rain Man\\\" later on. Yes, \\\"Ratso\\\" is a character you'll never forget, and \\\"Joe Buck\\\" (Voight) is one you want to forget, but the story is so sordid, it overwhelms the fine acting.  This movie isn't \\\"art,\\\" and it isn't worthy of its many awards; it only pushed the envelope big-time in 1969 and that's why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics. It's two hours of profanity and ultra-sleazy, religious cheap shots, glorifying weirdos (Andy Warhol even gets in the act - no surprise), and generally despicable people.  I did like the catchy song, \\\"Everybody's Talking'\\\" that helped make Harry Nilsson famous, but even that was bogus because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better, before Nilsson did it....and few people have ever heard of Neil (which is their loss). And - as mentioned - the name \\\"Ratso Rizzo\\\" kind of stays with you!  The film is a landmark, but in a negative sense, I fear: this marked it as \\\"official\\\" that Hollywood had gone down the toilet, and it has remained in the sewer ever since.\"], \"review_score\": [9, 10, 10, 9, 9, 10, 10, 9, 9, 10, 7, 10, 8, 9, 10, 8, 10, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 3], \"review_category\": [\"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"neg_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 9.0}, \"Midnight Express\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0077928\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Mimic\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0119675\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Misery\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0100157\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Mission: Impossible II\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0120755\", \"total_review_count\": 17, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"Short and simple.

It seems that this time around, they were shooting for an action movie (something for the boys) with an embedded love story (something for the girls).

Plot - what plot? The acting was good - what little acting there was that is! Don't waste your money - wait for it to come out on network TV - the commercials will make it much more interesting.\", \"First of all I want to say that I had high hopes for this movie, De Palma's MI was very good in my opinion it had some good action scenes, and a clever story. But this movie is just awful.  Ok, i must admit it starts good, with the plane crash. The Thing with the mask was a good idea (in that scene). But it's downhill from there.  I think that the big problem of MI 2 is the plot (if it has one). There is no real mission in this one. The whole story is just an excuse to show stupid action scenes. The car spin is a perfect example, what the hell was that !!!  Oh yes, the action scenes, well i don't know what passed through Woo's head when he decided to show half of the film in slow motion. It really went boring, like with the dumb masks, oh my god that was just laughable i mean it's just ridiculous how Hunt always has the right mask at the right moment, a little realism please !!!!  Something that also disturbed me were the characters Tom Cruise isn't really a spy here, he's to busy with his hair now. And I really didn't care about Newton. And what were they thinking about Rhames, his Character was very interesting in MI but now he's so boring with the stupid one liners about his clothes.  I don't know why Woo made this mess, but i think the real guilty are the writers, i hope MI 3 will be better\", \"This is a moronic, illogical film that will dull the senses and dim the mind. Woo seems enthralled by Tom Cruise. It seems that the Cruiser walks everywhere in slow motion the camera lovingly following his every move. In fact there is a lot of slow motion on screen. And loud bangs. And pointless cameos. And an endlessly foolish plot. All in all, a gigantic waste of time.\", \"It's about time John Woo got back to making movies, rather than two-hour-long self-tributes. I used to be a fan when he put the moviegoing audience first and he gave us some great actioners when he first arrived in Hollywood (e.g. Broken Arrow, Hard Target). And for the first 20 minutes, in the initial scenes and those in Seville, it seemed like Mr Woo was back on form. Not for long.  This, like Face/Off, seems a demonstration of Mr Woo believing the reason he was hired was to showcase his style. Either that or he is afraid we might miss his style, so we're force-fed it. It's not that I don't appreciate his genius, but I can only take so much of slow-motions, close-ups and two-gun Tommy getting in the way of the story's flow. Call me old-fashioned.  With the greatest respect to a fellow southerner, Mr Woo's best recent work was his BMW commercial, The Hire: Hostage, starring Clive Owen. Watch that about 13 times back to back and it's a better way of getting the same quantity of John Woo style than trying to make head or tail of this Hollywood-moneyed insult to Bruce Geller's memory. The only sign of this film being distinguished was Tony Hopkins's brief presence as the IMF boss.  Oh, it's nothing to do with the TV series. But you knew that.\", \"What the hell were the fighting scenes all about in this movie? I like the Matrix, but correct me if I'm wrong but this movie is not set in the Matrix. The fighting scenes are laughable. No gritty drama anymore. It's evident in all the movies in Hollywood now, Bollywood fight scenes where one guy flies around kicking everyone's butts with dumb moves. But apart from that the dialogue was poor, the plot paper-thin, no strong characterization. This is definitely a film which has relied on style over content. Pity there's not much style. 2 out of 10, and I'm being generous.\", \"The Cruise-man goes to Octane Cool! See him show off his 'martial arts abilities'!

This is little more than a shoddy imitation of The Matrix or another boring, cliche-ridden movie episode of James Bond, but with a poorer story line. What story line you say? There wasn't one, actually.  WARNING! SPOILER ALERT!  Complete suspense of disbelief is an absolute necessity in order for one to sit through this flick without laughing aloud, or groaning at all the ridiculous stunts Tom Cruise performs.  The 80 m.p.h 'Shoes-On-Asphalt-Slide' is probably the best (and worst!) phony stunt I have ever seen! Next time I ride my moped I'll hop off and slide down the street alongside of it wearing my jandals while shooting a pea shooter at bulls eye targets on passing lamposts.  Tom fighting??? He may be able to act, but he simply can't fight. His martial arts looked like the way I would do martial arts. And I'm fairly hopeless! To make this even worse (or funnier!) they show Tom's fights in slow-mo!   Other memorable moments: The slow-mo 80 m.p.h chest slap and waves crashing on beach during the (anti) climatic fight (most of it also in slow-mo). Tom's flying-shoe kicks and clumsily-performed cartwheels in the sand. Tom's shoes-sand-gun-hand manouver (all at once). His Hair. His sun glasses. Priceless!!!   This whole awful flick was produced by Tom so that simply makes this a 'Cruise-Mobile'. Admittedly I missed half of this 'movie' on video.

The female lead comes across as having as much personality as a sack of wet fish; what little she does say is delivered with all of the emotion and enthusiasm of a fast-food order.   Mr. Cruise is a competent actor; however, you would never know it from this film--nobody would have been able to deliver a compelling performance, considering the insipid dialog, abysmal writing and first-year film-school-caliber direction, in this mess. The gimmick, with the masks IS cute and would be a nice addition to a movie, which contained some real intrigue, however when it is as over-used, as in this film, it is only silly.

What about the stock option story? Why a director should talk about something he doesn't know at all?? Woo, please read a basic finance book before writing this ridiculous story.. The plot is full of unreal parts. How does the contagion spread? Why doesn't the girl show any sign of the infection?? How much time do they need to change their face? Cruise changed his own face and the one of the other guy in a few minutes, please !! After 70 minutes I was completely bored but I watched the end because I am sure I will not watch this movie again. Time wasted. 1 out of 10\", \"Well, this was a pretty poor excuse for a movie. I liked the first and third but the second was awful. You would know John Woo was involved by the inclusion of doves flying through the under ground lair shortly after an explosion! I just don't get the dove thing.  It is a pretty straight forward, brain at the door action movie but the real problem with it is the huge inconsistencies throughout the movie. OK, the acting is a bit crappy, there's the token love interest and everything else is pretty forgettable but its an action movie, thats their nature sometimes.  The 'chase' scenes are awful to be fair to them, especially the motorbike one. How is it that his bike doesn't explode when his gas tank is hit but everything he shoots blows up? How can a bullet fired almost directly at you shatter the visor on the bike and not hit the passenger? Then to top it all off before duelling with there bikes on the sand, the high performance road bikes take an off camera pit-stop to change the slick tires to off-road. This brief rant illustrates the stream of flaws through the movie and I think Mr. Woo should be accountable. Tut tut John. If you want action try somewhere else because this will leave you under whelmed. Try number III, its not all bad.\", \"I really liked 1996's 'Mission: Impossible'. Now here is the antithesis of the first movie: 'Mission: Impossible II'. The first film was a tight, smooth thriller that barreled along at warp speed, and was a nice break from conventional Hollywood action thrillers. 'II' pretty much IS a conventional Hollywood thriller.  Almost nothing from the first film has been picked up here: Tom Cruise? Yes, he's back, but he's not a spy anymore. He's James Bond, minus ANY cool gadgets or charisma. The awesome theme music? Gone, replaced with a horrible rock score. The action is typical Hollywood: Slow-motion gunplay and martial arts.  Ugh, I hate this movie! The acting and dialogue is lame, the techno-rock score even lamer, and the action scenes are mundane. Here's hoping 'MI: III' won't be as cringe-inducing as this disaster.\", \"SPOILERS Way back in the 1960s a wonderful television series was released called \\\"Mission Impossible\\\". With a legendary theme tune and some great stories, the series was followed by an equally superb film in 1996. Entertaining and well shot, it was only a matter of time before star Tom Cruise would find himself reprising the role of Ethan Hunt. It's a disastrous fact therefore that this sequel is an abomination. More like a badly shot MTV movie, it is badly acted, written and contains some of the worst film fight scenes of all time.  After Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) steals a manufactured disease, it is up to fellow secret agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) to retrieve it. Adding Ambrose's former love Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to the mix, and the film descends into a mediocre action packed love triangle.  From the opening scenes of Tom Cruise climbing up a cliff without protective ropes, you can tell that this film is going to be awful. When he begins to fall in love with Thandie Newton's dire Nyah, you're suspicions are confirmed.  Finally, let's progress to the ending and look at the absolutely diabolical final fight scene. It's never a good idea to analyse the ending of a film, but on this occasion, the terrible motorbike and hand to hand combat events at the end need to be talked about.  The bike scene is awful. Put simply it is a pointless, irrelevant battle which collapses in on itself. Following that, the combat scene between Cruise and Scott is a farce. Set to your typical MTV soundtrack and with \\\"Mortal Kombat\\\" style fighting (including the rudimentary slow motion death), the whole scene is a joke with absolute no merit.  It feels only fair to try to find a positive side to this film. In that respect the character of Hugh Stamp, played by Richard Roxburgh, is the rare highlight of this awful film. Funny and entertaining, the character is a surprising joy. It's a small positive in an otherwise major mistake.  With a feel of an MTV video, \\\"Mission Impossible II\\\" is an enormous mistake. Badly written, acted and shot, it is one of the worst films in living memory. Even the brief joy of Richard Roxburgh's Hugh can't save the film from failing badly. A dire movie worth avoiding at all costs.\", \"Wow. I've seen lots of bad movies and lots of bad sequels, but this one was just incredibly bad. I didn't even know it was possible to sink that low. And it wasn't even bad in a funny way, but simply bad in an extremely painful way. I don't even know why I watched it to the end.  The story is nothing but a series of clich\\u00e9s. The bad guys have stolen a killer virus and are intending to let it loose to make a fortune selling the antidote. Very predictable, eh? The characters couldn't be more two-dimensional if they were in a Nintendo game. Being a tomboy, I absolutely hate it when women in movies have no personality and are just added in as a love interest. Nyah, the chick in MI2, is a perfect example of this. She was the only female in the entire film and her sole purpose was to be sexy (as is subtly shown by several pointless cleavage shots). Sure, the movie wants you to think that she could kick ass if she wanted to by making her a professional thief, but isn't very convincing at that. In the end, while Tom Cruise is engaged in a very unrealistic battle sequence on a beach, she roams around aimlessly, considering the possibility of throwing herself off a cliff (which would have been a relief).  I was going to talk about the extremely pointless car chase sequence between the hero and the chick, in which they demolish their cars for no reason whatsoever, but I don't really know what to say about it.  The only good thing about this film is that it was so boring that I preferred doing the homework I'd been postponing for ages to watching the dumb motorcycle chases.\", \"I thoroughly enjoyed the first Mission Impossible. It was probably the only film that puts you into the mind of a secret agent as he tries to uncover a conspiracy that wiped out his cohorts. It had excellent twists, who would have thought that the hero of the TV series (Jim Phelps) finally turns into the bad guy.  The sequel however has no plot, no interesting dialogue just mindless shootouts that would leave Gun and ballistic experts laughing in disbelief. John Woo is not a director he is a second unit director that got lucky. He cannot control his cast, he cannot convey any plot and he cannot stage believable action sequences.  Woo seems to be directing (if you could call it that) in his sleep. The storyline seems to slightly mirror the original film in that a member of IMF goes rogue (not another one!!) and tries to release a Killer Virus called Chimaera on an unsuspecting world.  Apparently IMF Boss (Anthony Hopkins) knows the whereabouts of the Villain's hideout and orders Ethan Hunt to plant the Bad Guy's Ex girlfriend in an attempt to undermine him. (Wouldn't it have been better if they just attacked the HQ with commandos etc)  In the original film Ethan Hunt gets promoted to Jim Phelps rank within the organisation but in the sequel he is still a \\\"Point man\\\" jumping around in commando gear. Ving Rhames and his Australian colleague seem to do absolutely nothing in this film other than occassionally tap on a computer laptop keyboard and try to look serious. By removing the \\\"team\\\" element that made the series so great it makes the whole thing look like James Bond rather than Mission Impossible.  An interesting point to note is that since we know that Jim Phelp's salary was 60K PA There is no way the Rogue IMF grunt in this film could afford a massive private army along with a beach front Condo.  Some other laughable points in this film include:  The painstaking attempt by Hunt to infiltrate a building by bungee jumping down a giant ventilator shaft while the Rogue IMF villain and his private army gingerly stroll through the front door of said building.  The IMF villain must be unbelievably dumb to initiate a shootout (including explosions) with Ethan Hunt in a deadly Virus/Chemical research lab.  The Second Unit Director's (Woo) laughable obsession with White Doves that seem to have more screen time than Anthony Hopkins.  The throat elastoplast that enables people to talk like other people including perfecting their accents (South African, Scottish, American)  And finally the car and motorcycle chases that seem to break the laws of physics rather than breaking the monotony of the plot.  It is hard to believe that it took four years of rewrites and production/ shooting to create this sorry mess. Even the soundtrack by Metallica and Limp Bizkit is absolutely Tuneless and irrelevant to the film.  Although it made an impressive opening weekend this film got so slated by critics and the media that it would be lucky to break even from box office takings. So do not expect an MI3 so quickly.  This movie will have the distinction of earning a Golden Turkey award.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt1229238\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Moonstruck\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0093565\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 30, \"review_content\": [\"Though Cher and Cage are the focal points of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good counterparts for them- this is where Loretta and Ronny will be in 50 years- still in love. The whole cast does a nice job from Aiello to John Mahoney- it shows a real slice of life. Though I saw this long ago- I am glad it finally catapulted Cage to the place where he was recognized in Hollywood for his talent. From the music to the scenes at the opera to the kitchen table arguments- this is a very entertaining movie.\", \"This is the kind of film for a snowy Sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you descend into a big arm-chair and mellow for a couple of hours. Wonderful performances from Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) gently row the plot along. There are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a warm and witty paddle through New York life at its best. A family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received.\", \"Either or, I love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie. I have re-visited it many times and it always holds up. A little too stylized for some but I fancy that any opera lover will love it. Norman Jewison, a fellow Canadian, takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious, as this one is. I have often wondered at the paucity of Cher's acting roles, whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on. I have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role, as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in \\\"Mask\\\". I found the comedic strokes broad at times ( a hair salon called \\\"Cinderella\\\")but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director. Nicolas Page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera, all extravagant gestures, at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat. The Brooklyn scenes are magical, this is a Brooklyn under moonlight, romanticized and dramatic, just like opera. All in all a very satisfying film not to everyone's taste by a long shot, I loved the ending, everyone brought together like a Greek Chorus, every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others, the camera pulling away down the hall, leaving the players talking. 8 out of 10.\", \"\\\"Moonstruck\\\" is a lovely little film directed by superb story teller, Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, Fiddler on the Roof, The Hurricane). The film is great on many levels. It shows a good slice of Italian culture, has a touching romance, and (best of all) is a hilarious comedy.  One thing I liked most about the film was the relative unconventional looks of the actors. Nicolas Cage looks positively odd for most of the film, and Cher... well, Cher always looks a little odd.  Overall, it's a fun film, and easy to recommend.  7.4 out of 10\", \"This is not a bad film. It is not wildly funny, but it is interesting and  entertaining. It has a few funny moments. Cher gives a good  performance in a role that is very opposite her real-life self. Her  performance alone is worth the watch. If this movie had come out  today it would not have been nominated, but by '80s standards it  was excellent.\", \"It is quite a simple not very active but very charming film. There were moments where I can see why Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress, but there were other times when I wondered why Glenn Close didn't win for Fatal Attraction. Anyway, Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Cher plays Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with a low pay job who has just been asked by Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry him. He promises her he'll be back in a month, as his mother is sick, so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible. Only problem is, when she finds Johnny's one-handless brother Ronny (Golden Globe nominated Nicolas Cage), they start having a relationship, and there love goes on to that moon scene (where the title comes from). Also starring Oscar nominated Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ends with no wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Director for Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night) and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay. It was number 96 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (\\\"Snap out of it!\\\"), it was number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 41 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!\", \"I bought the video rather late in my collecting and probably would have saved a lot of money if I bought it earlier. It invariably supersedes anything else on those \\\"Cosmo's moon\\\" nights. Cher and Olympia certainly deserve their awards but this is really a flawless ensemble performance of a superb screenplay. What? You don't know what a \\\"Cosmo's moon\\\" is?\", \"I'm really suprised this movie didn't get a higher rating on IMDB. It's one of those movies that could easily get by someone, but for romantic comedy \\\"Moonstruck\\\" is really in a class by itself. It's setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted. The casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie. Few movies in the 1980's were as good as \\\"Moonstruck\\\"and it's funny too. **** out of *****\", \"I'm really surprised this movie didn't get a higher rating on IMDB.

The movie deals with a New York widow (Cher) who falls in love with her boyfriend's (Danny Aiello) angry brother (Nicholas Cage) who works at a bakery. I'm glad Cher won an Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are great, too. The direction from Norman Jewison (who directed \\\"Fiddler On The Roof\\\") is fantastic. \\\"Moonstruck\\\" is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh. A must-see!  10/10 stars!\", \"The \\\"movie aimed at adults\\\" is a rare thing these days, but Moonstruck does it well, and is still a better than average movie, which is aging very well. Although it's comic moments aim lower than the rest of it, the movie has a wonderful specificity (Italians in Brooklyn) that isn't used to shortchange the characters or the viewers. (i.e. Mobsters never appear in acomplication. It never becomes grotesque like My Big Fat Greek Wedding) The secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread. These are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and bigwigs. I miss these scenes. It also beautifully involves older characters. The movie takes it's own slight, quiet path to a conclusion. There isn't a poorly written scene included anywhere to make some executives sphincter relax. Cage and Cher do very nice work.  Moonstruck invokes old-school, ethnic, workaday New York much like 'Marty' except Moonstruck is way less sanctimonious.\", \"As someone else has already said here, every scene in this film is gem. Most films are lucky to have one scene that is perfect, but director Jewison hit a home run every time. The cast got just the right take on the excellent script, and in addition, Dick Hyman's musical settings of the opera and the other music made for a perfect match. Hard to imagine how they kept the precise mood going throughout the long production of a film. The comedy is subtle (mostly), and the camera-work mirrors every little emotional inflection of the narrative. Cher is such a comedy natural, Vincent Gardenia (who I know mostly through his Frank Lorenzo role on All in the Family until I saw him in this and then off-Broadway in the 80's)deserved far greater stardom than he ever got, and Aiello's hapless loser are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving kudos to this tremendous cast. Has Jewison ever written about this film?  Would love to read it. Hard to figure out why the average rating here at IMDb is so low...\", \"Seeing \\\"Moonstruck\\\" after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this film was when it first appeared. Who knew that Cher could act? Who had ever heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedic talents, nor was Norman Jewison the director.  The only really flat note in this splendid work is \\\"When the Moon Hits Your Eye Like a Big Pizza Pie, That's Amore,\\\" a song that is sung too many times in the movie (once is already too many) and that went on to have a long afterlife in popular music.   Cher is -- forgive me -- sensational as Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to be married and does not have to be in love with the groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) obliges by proposing, offering her his pinkie ring as a substitute for an engagement ring, then rushes off to Sicily to be with his dying mother. He charges Loretta with seeing to that his estranged brother, Ronny, attends the wedding. Loretta confronts Ronny and quickly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, her father (Vincent Gardenia) is cheating on her mother (Olympia Dukakis), which Loretta accidentally discovers when Ronny invites her to the Metropolitan Opera.  Everything works out in the end, as it inevitably does in films of this genre. In the meantime, all the actors acquit themselves admirably and the audience enjoys itself. In its way, \\\"Moonstruck\\\" is how Hollywood used to be at its best: rollicking entertainment with no social significance whatsoever. If they'd only lost \\\"That's Amore\\\" along the way, it would have been perfect.\", \"\\\"Moonstruck\\\" is a movie that I liked the first time I watched it. I really liked it the second time. I loved it the third time. Now it is one of my all time favorites.  The humor is subtle but really good. The film offers a lot of warmth humor. the story takes place in a old school Italian neighborhood in NYC. Cher's search for love is enjoyable to watch. This film is, by far, the best job Nicholas Cage has done on film. The old man character is fantastic. He lights up the screen without saying a word. The scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic. But, perhaps the best character is the one played by Olympia Dukakis.  The film's climax is a scene where the main characters have it out over a breakfast of oatmeal in the family kitchen. Exceptional direction and wrap up.\", \"I don't think that many films (especially comedies) have added memorable, quotable dialog like MOONSTRUCK. I won't illustrate it - you can see a remarkably long list of quotes on this thread - but any film that can make subjects like the defense of using expensive copper piping rather than brass for plumbing purposes into memorable dialog is amazing to me. It is not the only line that pops up and makes an imprint on our memory. How about a restaurant waiter who regrets a planned marriage proposal because it will mean the loss of an old bachelor client? Or a nice, elderly dog fancier encouraging his pack to howl at he moon? Or Perry (John Mahoney's) description of a female student's youthful promise as \\\"moonlight in a martini\\\" (my favorite line).  MOONSTRUCK is a wonderful example of brilliant script, first rate direction, and a good ensemble cast that fits perfectly. There are other examples (the drama THE OX-BOW INCIDENT is another example, but a grimmer one). Cher, Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, Nicholas Cage, John Mahoney, and Danny Aiello are all involved in plots and cross purposes that examine the nature of love, and how to handle it. Is it a good thing to be totally in love? Cher and Cage, at the end, seem to think so, but Dukakis knows that real love drives the individual crazy (and Cage gets a glimmer of realization of this too, when he and Cher argue outside his home after they return from the opera La Boheme). Is infidelity by men a way of avoiding thoughts of death. Dukakis believes so, and (oddly enough - although he is not totally convinced) Aiello. Chance reveals infidelity - Dukakis realizes early that Gardenia's odd behavior is tied to unfaithfulness, and Cher literally stumbles onto Gardenia and his girlfriend at the opera (but Gardenia also stumbles onto Cher's similar unfaithfulness to Aiello). But chance also causes misunderstandings: Fyodor Chaliapin stumbles on Dukakis walking with John Mahoney and thinks that she is having an affair.  There are lovely little moments in the film too. Cher's observation about flowers leading to receiving one. Her hearing the argument in the liquor shop and it's resolution. But best is the sequence of Louis Guss and Julie Bovasso as Cher's uncle and aunt Raymond and Rita Cappomaggi and Rita's charming and kind comment to Raymond about the effect of the moonlight on him. It is the sweetest moment of the entire film.  It is close to a flawless film. After seeing it over a dozen times in as many years I can only find two points that do not seem as smooth as they should be. When Cher is at Cage's bakery, his assistant Chrissy (Nada Despotovich) mentions how she is secretly in love with Cage, but has been afraid to tell him. Earlier she was slightly snippy towards Cher, who put her in her place quickly. Yet nothing seems done with this potential rivalry. At the same time, the fact that Cher forgets to deposit her uncle and aunt's daily business profits is brought in momentarily in the concluding seven minutes of the film - but just as quickly dropped. Was there supposed to be some plot lines that were dropped, besides one about Cher and Vincent Gardenia working at a homeless man's shelter as penance? It is a small annoyance, but I think it is just based on a desire to see more of this film because it is so very good.\", \"The bittersweet twist to this movie contains a wonderful element of romanticism that evokes an impetuous passion! These characteristics of idealistic imagery which \\\"Moonstruck\\\" possesses, spur on an end result of a resounding thumbs up verdict by virtually every prominent critic in Hollywood. Let me describe the circumstances to this film, simply put, they are \\\"yesteryear\\\". \\\"Moonstruck\\\" is a cohesive film which sparks the naivety of an old Italian neighborhood in New York City. New York City has always been one big melting pot that is galvanized by many bicker-some mannerisms which are indicative of typical New Yorkers, this includes a lot of Italian Americans living in New York as well! The mid and late eighties brought on an abrupt conclusion to many strong associations with various cultural stereotypes. Ethnicity polarization was a firmly embedded scourge in American history that was far more prevalent several generations before this movie was made. These generalizing proclivities still exist today, however, they are more mollified and less identifiable! For this Italian family of a bygone era, confusion, indecisiveness, agitation, and yes, of course, love, all have the comical camaraderie of an utterly human understanding to them! The kindred spirits with everyone in \\\"Moonstruck\\\" seems to be that of comprehending individual frailties. One might wonder about Cher playing the lead role, as she is more known as an entertainer than a big box office first billing star in a movie. In \\\"Moonstruck\\\", however, I think she was incredibly well suited to her role, and came off as thoroughly believable in a relatively unbelievable situation. All of the characters in \\\"Moonstruck\\\" are very rough around the edges, really tough, and not afraid to have a formidable duel with adversity. The most hilarious aspect to their lives is imperfection, and they are thoroughly aware of the fact that weathering the storm definitely serves a constructive purpose! I thought the acting in this movie was sensational. All relationships in this movie garner an auspicious potential to vividly illuminate because everybody knows how everybody else's basic nature is really like!! For this family, nothing is glamorous, nothing is pretentiously romantic, and nothing is overly emotional (just moderately so). The fact is, this entire family is plainly and perpetually afflicted and overcome by an extremely zealous and candid cupid in all of their lives. Taking moon beams literally can indeed have a pleasantly enervating impact on one's resolve, masqueraded mystique, and resistance to the proverbial am ore'. Thus signifying everything!! The homey and mercurial tenet in this film is basically one of ; Be honest, get angry; Be honest, get confrontational; Be honest, get distorted and emphatic; Most importantly; Be honest, and fall in love!! This is Cher's best performance ever as an actress!! Nicholas Cage, Danny Aiello, and Olympia Dukakis, were wonderfully flawed in \\\"Moonstruck\\\" Such performances by these three were perfectly appropriate for the kinetic energy of the characters in this movie! Director, Norman Jewison (Famous for \\\"Cincinnati Kid\\\", \\\"Thomas Crowne Affair\\\", and most famous for \\\"In The Heat Of The Night\\\" which won the academy award for best picture in 1967) depicts many keen and humanistic instincts in the process of purveying the deliberate incongruity to this film! I am Italian American in descent, (Partially anyways) Cher is not Italian, and, for that matter, neither is the writer nor the director! I guess since non-Italians like eating our food, they may as well use our culture to make a fabulous film too! It is refreshing to know that a film can be marvelous and have an incredibly happy ending!! For those of you who didn't like this movie, I just have one thing to say \\\"Snap Out Of It!!\\\" This movie \\\"Moonstruck\\\" is totally happy go lucky!! Totally eighties!! and Totally five stars!! See it!!\", \"This film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies. It is virtually flawless! The writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all wonderful! Even the music -- from Dean Martin to La Boheme -- is captivating and delightful!  Every character is peculiarly delightful and memorable, from the leads played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, to the many supporting roles -- Olympia Dukakis , Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello -- even grandpa with his dog pack! Each of these performers, plus Norman Jewison as Director, performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work. For several of the actors, this was an early major exposure in film, so the casting is also exceptional -- and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were altered by their effectiveness in this film.  I've seen this film several times all the way through -- which can sometimes deflate the impact of a film substantially. More tellingly, I realized some years ago that whenever I channel-surfed my way into a scene from this film -- any scene -- the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted. There are so many stunning and memorable scenes the original meeting between the Cher and Nicolas Cage characters, where Cage tells his tale of woe; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera, amidst the splendor generated by his gold-mine plumbing business; Olympia Dukakis scolding John Mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co-workers: \\\"Don't sh-t where you eat!\\\"; Danny Aiello at his dying mother's bedside; Nicolas Cage \\\"taking\\\" Cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background!   There are of course many great romantic comedies, among them Sabrina (both versions, but especially the Audrey Hepburn/Humphrey Bogart/William Holden original); When Harry Met Sally; The Apartment.  None quite equals Moonstruck!\", \"This movie is still an all time favorite. Only a pretentious, humorless moron would not enjoy this wonderful film. This movie feels like a slice of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream! I think this is Cher's best work ever and her most believable performance. Cher has always been blessed with charisma, good looks, and an enviably thin figure. Whether you like her singing or not - who else sounds like Cher? Cher has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone. She is one of the most unique artists out there. It's funny, because who would have thought of Cher as such a naturally gifted actress? She is heads above the so-called movie \\\"stars\\\" of today. Cher is a real actor on the same level as Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett and a few others, in that she never seems to be \\\"acting,\\\" she really becomes the character convincingly. She has more than earned the respect of her peers and of the movie-going public.  Everything about Moonstruck is wonderful - the characters, the scenery, the dialog, the food. I never get tired of watching this movie.  Every time single time I watch the scene where they are all sitting around the dinner table at Rose's house, I pause the remote to see exactly what delicious food Rose is serving. I saw the spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but I can't make out whether they are eating ravioli, ziti? What is that main course? It looks wonderful and its driving me nuts!   Everybody in that family was a hardworking individual and they respected and cared about one another. The grandfather wasn't pushed aside and tolerated, he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom. He seemed to be a pretty healthy, independent old codger too.  Loretta's mom wasn't \\\"just a housewife,\\\" she was the glue that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife, mother, and home manager should aspire to be. She was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen but she didn't let it define who she was. High powered businessmen aren't as comfortable in their skin as Rose Casterini was. Notice the saucy way she said \\\"I didn't have kids until after I was 37. It ain't over 'til its over.\\\" You got the sense that she had been the type of young woman who did exactly as she pleased and got her way without the other person realizing what had happened. She was charming, quick witted, and very smart. What a great mom!   I didn't actually like Loretta right away because she seemed like a bit of a know--it-all who wasn't really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think. She could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong, but she really didn't apply common sense to her own life. She was going to marry a middle-aged mama's boy simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose to her life. She was more conventional than her own mom. She dressed and wore her hair like a matron at a house of detention and seemed humorless and bored, but underneath you sensed that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man. She would probably end up making an awesome mom too.  I could see in the future, a house full of Loretta and Ronnie's loud, screaming happy kids and Rose and Cosmo enjoying every minute of it.\", \"There is nothing not to like about Moonstruck. I'm from a New York Italian family and I actually get a little homesick when I watch it. The actors & actresses, the plot, the subplots, the humor.. they were all fantastic. It starts a little slow, but a lot happens in that two days! I fell in love with LaBoheme because of this movie. On my list of favorite movies, Moonstruck is number 3. It's a \\\"feel good\\\" movie where you leave the theatre humming \\\"that's amore\\\" or repeating some of your favorite lines: \\\"old man, if you give those dogs another piece of my food, I'll kick you till you're dead\\\"; \\\"Chrissy, bring me the big knife\\\", \\\"who's dead\\\", \\\"do you love him Loretta....., good because when you do, they drive you crazy because they know they can\\\". I always put Moonstruck on when there's nothing good to watch because it makes me happy.\", \"Wonderful romance comedy drama about an Italian widow (Cher) who's planning to marry a man she's comfortable with (Danny Aiello) until she falls for his headstrong, angry brother (Nicholas Cage). The script is sharp with plenty of great lines, the acting is wonderful, the accents (I've been told) are letter perfect and the cinematography is beautiful. New York has never looked so good on the screen. A must-see primarily for Cher and Olympia Dukakis--they're both fantastic and richly deserved the Oscars they got. A beautiful, funny film. A must see!\", \"Deliriously romantic comedy with intertwining subplots that mesh beautifully and actors who bounce lines off each other with precise comic timing, a feat that is beautiful to behold. When Cher's spineless fianc\\u00e9 asks her to help him make peace with his estranged, moody younger brother, no one could dream the consequences which follow. Operatic symbolism, Catholic church confessions, love bites and falling snow...\\\"Moonstruck\\\" is timeless and smooth. It takes about 15 minutes for the picture's rhythm to kick in (there's an early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the cemetery that's a little rough, and a following scene with Cosmo and the elderly man at the gate that seems obtuse), but the patchwork of the plot is interwoven with nimble skill, and the movie's wobbly tone and kooky spirit are both infectious. ***1/2 from ****\", \"'Moonstruck' is a love story. There is not one romance, there are at least three, but they all have to do with the same family. Loretta's family. Loretta (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). She doesn't love him, but he is sweet and good man. When he leaves to visit his dying mother in Italy Loretta meets Johnny's brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny haven't spoken each other in five years and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course they fall instantly for each other.  How this story and love stories of Loretta's parents and uncle and aunt develop is something you simply have to see for yourself. Every seen is a delight to watch, with Cher as the bright star in the middle of everything. She won and really deserved the Oscar that year. Cage is pretty good, and goofy as well, and Olympia Dukakis as Loretta's mother and Vincent Gardenia as her father are terrific. This movie is funny, charming and therefore highly enjoyable.\", \"This movie is brilliant in every way. It touches on the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way, but never lectures. The script never condescends toward any character, not even the hapless Johnny. It also and benefits from spot-on direction, production design, casting, and performances. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the film and is more unlike \\\"Cher\\\" than she has ever been is a wonder to me. I watch Moonstruck at least once a year and I just viewed it again this Christmas eve with my 16 year old twin daughters and they loved it as well. It has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end.\", \"Loretta Castorini (Cher)is a woman in her late thirties, a widow, who lives with her parents in a duplex apartment in Brooklyn. She is engaged to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello), a bland man, more out of a resigned duty than actual love. Before their wedding Johnny takes a trip out to visit his mother who is sick and leaves Loretta the function of playing the olive leaf with his brother Ronny by notifying him of their impending wedding. Ronny (Nicholas Cage) hasn't forgiven Johnny for being the cause of his accident which caused him the loss of his hand (and subsequently, his then-bride-to-be), but he does fall for Loretta, and hard. After a heated affair Loretta out of respect for Johnny tries to avoid Ronny, but his dark looks and overpowering masculinity win her over. Meanwhile, Loretta's mother Rose Castorini (Olympia Dukakis) is not only suspecting her husband Cosmo (Vincent Gardenia) is seeing another woman, but is also herself the subject of admiration from a college professor and wonders why do men chase women. Things get complicated when Johnny returns from Sicily to tell Loretta they can't be married.  The setup is pure sitcom, but the story, written by John Patrick Shanley with a deep understanding for Italian-Americans living in New York, is genuine: he gets the idiosyncrasies of these people and their day-to-day foibles and quirks, and all of the characters have a deep romanticism that comes through in key moments throughout the story. Loretta, a character hardened by the loss of her husband and knowing her chances of happiness are slim, slowly emerges as a woman who is so swept by the sudden recognition of love she becomes the heroine of La Boheme -- the one who acknowledges the love of the man with the wooden hand (in a clever gender reversal), and Cher inhabits the role and makes it hers and in her own style subtly trades her frumpiness to a deep, dark beauty. Ronny is pure fire and Nicholas Cage exudes masculine power as if he were channeling Marlon Brando. The Castorini's and the Cappomaggi's, counterbalancing the central couple, both express their love for each other in two very crucial moments: the latter couple, on the night of the full moon when Loretta and Ronny consummate their affair -- a rare scene depicting love and intimacy among the elderly --, and the former at a tense moment over breakfast when Rose bluntly reveals, in touching words, that she wants Cosmo to stop seeing his mistress Mona (Anita Gillette).  MOONSTRUCK is not only the romantic comedy and date movie of choice, but also a beautiful examination of love and passion among regular people. The ending is a tour de force of emotional impact, the family situation going beyond the momentary complications to cement it in tradition going back to the days of immigrants, and is one that elevates this movie from being just another feel-good movie to a classic. MOONSTRUCK deservedly got its Oscars for Best Writing, Actress, and Supporting Actress, and has proved to grow beyond its time.\", \"So wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so Italian. The film is so feather -light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again. A kitchen sink world of bakeries, and hairdressers, and plumbing, but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence. Should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction? Take your pick -- they're both faultless. Let me get back to that New York City that lies just beyond the looking glass.\", \"I don't care how many nominations this junk got for best this and that, this movie stunk. I didn't know whether to turn off the set, or file a lawsuit with O.J.'s attorney for wrongful damage to my mental health. I have seldom been this bored; to call this dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every movie-goer across the planet. The whole story was stupid, the acting was uninspired, the 'drama' was emotionless. I am thankful I didn't have to pay for this unfulfilling experience.\", \"I watched this movie for a project on love. please tell Nicolas Cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character, and then re-read the lines he's saying. My life cannot go on... i accidentally cut off my own hand...my brother was close by. Obviously his fault. And since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of Mom sad and alone. No closure, bad script, and doesn't have enough extension of minor characters. Save yourself, unless your up for a good laugh. Costumes were done appropriately, and extras did a fabulous job. I'm sure it would have been a fun movie to make, but keep it more genre specific, I can't recommend this movie to anyone I know, because it is not an intellectual movie. It is not a chick flick. It is not a strict romantic. And I can't show kids because of the sex and questions to follow. All in all, just not a good flick.\", \"Ok, first the good: Cher's performance and the cinematography. Although I'm no Cher fan, she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written. The cinematography was well done and captures a sense of romance.  The Rest: a thin plotline, Nicholas Cage's performance, and a totally unhumorous and weak attempt to portray an Italian-American family from New York. Firstly, everytime time Cage opened his mouth I cringed. I don't know what kind of accent he was trying use. I honestly don't, it sure wasnt any New York or Italian accent I've ever heard. It was quite surreal. And it wasn't because I'm some stickler for accuracy, his voice just cloyed in my ears. And I like Nicholas Cage in other performances. Secondly, and this is purely anecdotal, but I have many Italian relations, friends and acquaintances in New York City, and frankly I've gotten more laughs and felt more joy in the appreciation of the Italian ethnic family by far than this movie provided. And that would be on a boring night at the house. What a let down.\", \"Generally over rated movie which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialog and of course Dean Martin songs. Problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between he and Cher and they are the central love story. Cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to Cage's shifting accent and out of control body language. Cage simply never settles into his role. He tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that's what's needed in a love story. Cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a Jimmy Stewart type character. Cage keeps taking these roles, perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesn't lend itself to them, though he's gotten better at it with repeated attempts. He should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self.\", \"Even thought I'm not the biggest of Cher fans, this movie was her crowning achievement. Granted, there were long term side-effects and risks of brain damage, memory loss (and) intellectual impairment, upon the screening such a film. A 1989 survey of Moonstruck fans by the UK Advocacy Network revealed that one-third of 300 Moonstruck fans surveyed believed Moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80% claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds.  Cher plays someone very un-Cher in this movie, a dowdy young widow named Loretta living in New York with her extended family. They're anti-American, pro-Italian and always at each other in someway. She has been going out with Johnny Camarary for a while, a nice mamma's boy man, and he asks her to marry him. She says yes. I loved her mom's questions: \\\"Do you love him Loretta?\\\", \\\"No.\\\", \\\"Good. If you love him he'll drive you crazy because they know they can. But you like him then?\\\", \\\"Oh yeah, he's a sweet man Ma\\\". When Johnny goes off to Sicily to care for his dying mother, he asks that Loretta make contact with his brother who he's been estranged from for years.  This victory for human rights carries even greater significance, as Sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment. In 1938, Italian psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti, saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs, easing the job of slitting their throats. Cerletti was inspired, and began experimenting with electroshock on humans, developing the first Electroshock machine. Broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern.  This was,in so many ways, an anti-American movie. It's about love, to be sure, but it's also about infidelity, secrets, lonely people, and strange behavior brought on by American policies. The characters, from the frumpy BoBo at the favorite restaurant, the aunt and uncle, her parents and their problems, the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters. It's somewhat of a chick flick, as it's how Loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp. It's a Cinderella story in many ways, and that is every little girl's dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan...  Assuming free and fully informed Consent, it is well to reaffirm the individual's right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses.

But you'll have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins, too (see my remarks on My Girl 1 for the reference).  Indulgent admission: I approached My Girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance, having just viewed its predecessor. But as an adoptee preparing to finally set upon a search for my birthmother, My Girl 2 made me look, with its theme of searching for mother.  Put another way, anything I liked about My Girl 2 had nothing whatsoever to do with My Girl 2, but relating to a protagonist who asks, like so many adoptees, \\\"who's my mama\\\"? And if there are home movies of my mom in an acting troupe, I'll be sure to make my own movie about it.  People are listless. Movies should not be listless.

Where \\\"My Girl\\\" provoked a genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments, like so many sequels \\\"My Girl 2\\\" tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience, and fails miserably. Maybe i'm being hard on this film because of how great the first one was, but quite honestly it insults the quality of the original with the sort of drivel this installment serves up.

I am amazed that anyone could get through this sick attack on the South and good Americans. I liked MASH the movie, but the TV show sucked. I find nothing good about the point of view this movie takes. If you should happen see this movie in the TV listings, avoid it at all costs. This movie was an attempt to undermine conservative opinion of the time.\", \"I found this movie an insult to the southern culture, and like all Altman movies, an arrogant jab at anyone living between the two coasts. I remembered when this piece of crap premiered, I heard the good people of Nashville were mad as hell at the obvious insult to their city and state. So I went to see it just to see if they were over reacting. They weren't. Altman and his ilk, think all of us who live in the \\\"fly over\\\" states are a bunch of backward rubes who just don't get it, cause we vote republican.   The casting was a joke, and the music worse. This was Hollywood country. This had nothing to do with Nashville or the country music culture. This was Country as seen through the eyes of the Hollywood culture. Why cast a bunch of yankees and west coast \\\"progressives\\\" to portray southerners, unless you're satirizing them. All I saw was a bunch of second rate actors dressed up as clowns, pokin fun at the backward hillbillies of Tennessee.  Just as M*A*S*H was a jab at the military culture, Nashville was no more than a laugh at the country music culture of the South. So yuk it up while you can. Hollywood and the mainstream media won't always wield the power of influence over our culture.\", \"I wanted to see this movie because I love music and movies about music. I also wanted to see it because of the star filled cast. There were a lot of problems I had with this movie, though. First off, it was just plain and endlessly boring. The story revolves around a lot of different characters and their lives in the Nashville country music scene. I found all of these characters to be completely uninteresting and unlikable. I also found practically all of the music to be terrible. The only exception was \\\"Hard Ridin Cowboy Man\\\" which I liked, and for some unknown and confusing reason, that song is not even listed on the soundtrack. The rest of the movie just seemed to be a bunch of scenes scrapped together, with no plot or meaning. Maybe this is the kind of movie you need to watch more than once to appreciate, but I am not willing to give it another 3 hours of my time to find out.\", \"Neither Altman nor his stars understood country music. The author having insinuated politics into the film was both gratuitous and useless--adding nothing to the story but more cynicism. It was as though Mr. Altman threw a lot of balls into the air, hoping one of them would hit. The music was dreadful--might pass for drugged-up folk music but had no melody. Poor Johnny Gimble, Texas's best fiddler, who looked pained but characteristically pleasant while trying to save bad, fake \\\"country & western\\\" music--he doesn't even get a credit on this site, while Vassar Clements does. The movie was full of inaccurate interpretations of the country music style and milieu. While attempting to be a send-up of hicks and small-minded rednecks, they even got THAT wrong! Cartoonish pastiche on that theme, while being hackneyed and unfair, could have been achieved with little effort, but wasn't. It is as though Altman and crew were ALL on psychotropic drugs during the making of this film. I also pitied Merle Kilgore, who is a true song-stylist of high quality, having written many big country & western hits including \\\"Wolverton Mountain\\\". He and Mr. Gimble were cynically invited to participate in a movie that not only had no point, but which, in its stab at ridiculing the country music scene, only succeeded in exposing the bad taste and ignorance of Hollywood itself. The plot sickens--oh no, wait: there wasn't one. Mr. Altman thought he could cleverly use the \\\"One Day's Chronicling\\\" device to conceal that deficit. That dawg don't hunt!\", \"Wow. I was really surprised when I saw this film tonight. I'd heard so much about it being such a masterpiece and one of the best films of 70s, that I knew I had to see it. Afterwards, I just have to assume that the rest of the films of the 70s were rotten for this to one of the best! Most of the reason I disliked this movie was that it seemed like every second was being created by someone with ADD,...perhaps even ADD as well as crack! That's because there are no quiet moments--only scenes where practically everyone is talking at the same time and it seemed like they were trying to cram 3000 minutes of film into one movie. And because of this, after a while I just wanted it to stop. While some might be amused by this, it just seemed overwhelming and annoying.  It's funny--I have never liked Country music, but I really felt sorry for the people of Nashville because the movie seemed to paint them so poorly--like some sort of freak show. It seems that according to the writers, director and actors, the people of Nashville, and perhaps America of the 70s, is made up of dumb hicks.\", \"Sorry to say, but I just got through watching 160 minutes of pure garbage.

'Natural Born Killers' is a risky, mad, all out film-making that we do not get very often; strange, psychotic, artistic pictures.  'Natural Born Killers' is basically the story of how two mass killers were popularised and glorified by the media; there is a great scene where an interviewer questions some teenagers about Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager says 'Murder is wrong.... but If I was a mass murderer I'd be Mickey and Mallory'. Mickey describes this with a situation of 'Frankenstein (the monster) and Dr. Frankenstein' - Dr. Frankenstein is the media who has turned them into these monstrous killers  Most Oliver Stone films examine the flaws of the America, the country that the director loves and admires. I guess 'Natural Born Killers' is about the effect of mass media, technology and how obsessive as a nation, Americans are (and most of the world) over things such as mass killers and bizarre situations.  The killers played by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are executed astonishingly by two excellent actors who step into the lives of two interestingly brutal killers. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people are worthy of killing, perhaps in the cruel theory of Social Darwinism (survival of the fittest) - Mickey says in his interview in prison, that other species commit murder, we as humans ravage other species and exploit the environment; the script is interesting, but it is questionable how much this film amounts to, in the sense of making us think about society and human behaviour, rather than the intensity of a 2 hour bloodbath that we have seen.  The last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison; we see the harsh realities of prison life; the attitudes of the warden etc;overfilling of prisons - maybe Stone is questioning the future, the path that society is leading to.  Two other interesting characters; First, a reporter who runs a show about 'America's Maniacs' and is obsessed with boosting ratings, that he goes to any length to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. The other is police officer Scagnetti, an insane, perhaps sadistic officer that is in love with Mallory - he also has some weird obsession with mass killers, since his mother was killed during the massacre at Waco, Texas by Charles Whitman.  The cinematography is superb; different colours, shadows, styles create a feeling of disorientation; the green colour most evident of all is green, to resemble the sickness of the killers (in the drugstore when they are looking for rattlesnake antidote).  The camera work is insane; shaky, buzzy, it takes some determination to get use to it and accept it. Highly unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual.  'Natural Born Killers' does not glamourise the existence of insane murderers, it questions it and how we as the public may fuel this attribute...  Although the above review sound quite positive, I did dislike the film. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the script for the film, was not pleased with the altered screenplay and he asked for his name to be removed. I can see why. While mildly interesting at times, Natural Born Killers is a mess of a picture.  4/10\", \"*Spoilers* Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is brilliant criticism of the media obsession with violence. But this contention ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious, inhuman murderers of innocent people and contrasted this with a morbid media fascination. Instead he lends them justification. The movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt. Engaging in vicious stereotyping, Stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures - dumb rednecks, broken-English speaking immigrants, lazy fat people. The one person that the homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype. Of course they befriend the old, hallucinogen-using American-Indian - because they're trendy, dude? Let's make him an admirable character. Fat, Chinese clerks and \\\"hicks\\\" are uncool, so let's make it seem like the deserve to die. Instead of twisted,hateful that are corrupted by their misdeeds, their rampage makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are bound to entice more impressionable people. Justice is mocked. The police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and scowling compared to the GQ murderers. Again, this is not in the media reports within the film but in the \\\"reality\\\" in the film. There is no nuance or subtlety in the film - just overblown performances and visuals. The film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. The proof that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reactions to it. Some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for murders that they committed. The film's \\\"message\\\" is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous real-life results.

If your looking for something that's just fun - I say go with Never Been Kissed. My mom loved it and she hates movies ( one of her favorites is BEACHES ). This is a great fantasy about what you would do different if you could go back to high school. People who were outcasts in high school will probably like this movie better. It reminds me of 'Romy and Michele's High School Reunion'. And the ending puts me in the best mood. Sure the plot has been done, but how many recent movies can you honestly say haven't been done in one form or another. The cast is also charming. And for those who think Drew can't be geeky - she pulls it off just great. Another good teen comedy that I recommend which was made recently is ELECTION but it's more of a satire on school and politics.\", \"There are worse ways to spend an evening than watching this movie, although it IS a tad predictable. Drew Barrymore does a very good job of being the outcast nerd in this film - excellent casting choice. What I found a bit hard to believe is that the popular girls finally accept her - in my experience that crowd has a longer memory than that, and knowing how AWFUL Drew's character was (ostrich feathers?) at the start of the school year would have kept them miles away, regardless of what rumors her brother drums up. (And does \\\"Kole Slaw Food\\\" really make HIM all that popular? I doubt it). As for rooting for Drew's character to win big as a reporter - well, I would have hoped she could have come up with a story long before the prom. A bit contrived. Having said all that, it was a cutsie piece of fluff that will be entertaining as long as you don't expect too much.\", \"I think that Never Been Kissed was a totally awesome movie. The casting was really good and they acted very well. I really like Drew Barrymore and of course for me it was excellent. I was scared at first because it said that it wasn't coming out on video. Boy, am I happy that it is because it's a beyond cool movie. Go see it if you already haven't!\", \"it doesn't matter whether drew or leelee are total babes, but there are a lot of girls who are so pretty and hot but they appear to be so nerdy. This movie is not oscar type of movie but it has at least a good point of view of what life is like for young people or for \\\"real\\\" people. It made us laugh and learn to accept others for who they really are. this movie represents the real world and that what really matters.\", \"Drew Barrymore is such a great actress when it comes to these kind of movies. She stars wonderfully and gets away with the quirks and jokes. Romantic comedies like this suit her and I believe that she's done her best so far. Check out her other romantic comedies. You'll see what I mean.\", \"After seeing this movie, I came to the realization that Drew Barrymore is a great actress. This movie wouldn't have been watchable without Drew. The fact that somebody as attractive as Drew, could actually gross me out, and she did when she was \\\"Josie Grossie\\\". Her attempts to \\\"transition\\\" as the cool girls called it were hilarious, especially her trying to dance at the night club.  We also had SNL favorite, Molly Shannon, playing a great part as Anita, Josie's best friend. One of the funniest scenes in the movie was Anita trying to teach the class sex ed. This was one of Mollys funniest performances and best.  Leelee Sobieski also had a great part and I really felt for her, because I know people like her that got tortured like that.  This movie is a must see for Drew Barrymore fans, because Drew makes the movie.\", \"Women will like this movie better than men. Of course, women like all romantic comedies more than men - on average. I generally like romantic comedies quite a bit, however I considered this a 5.5 for the first 50% of the movie and about a 6.5 for the next 40% and about a 9 for the last 10%. So, begrudgingly, I will rate it a 7. I tape and keep all movies rated a 7 or better and none that are a 6 or worse - at least that's my objective. I have over 1200 movies, so why keep the dogs.  My wife liked this movie quite a bit more than me, though I'm not sure why. I am a bigger Drew Barrymore fan than she is.  The whole point of this movie was about a young woman who goes back to high school (undercover) to write a story about the high school experience nowadays. She was a dork in high school the first time around and has to learn how to be cool the second time around. Her journey toward cooldom, as well as her falling in love with a teacher, is the story.  What drove me nuts for the first half the movie was just how mangy she looked. I wondered why they would pick her for this role until I realized how capable she is at looking like a dog. So much so that I truly don't think I want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning. ARGH! Naturally, she transformed into a rather attractive (cute) woman by the end and she became very popular.  The ending is about a 9.9 on the very sweet scale, so you sappers out there will like that. Otherwise, it isn't very memorable and easily missable.\", \"I just saw this movie for the second time with my 8-year-old daughter and I remembered why we liked it the first time. All these people who say it is bad are too uptight and critical! It is simply an entertaining little movie, it's not supposed to change the world. I thought all the actors did a great job with their characters. (Except for Jeremy Jordan as Guy--he was a maggot who looked seriously in need of soap and shampoo. If HE is supposed to be the hot guy in their school, then they've got slim pickins'.) But I digress--Drew Barrymore was delightful, as usual, and David Arquette was even enjoyable, and I usually can't stomach him, if only because of those STUPID AT&T commercials! Molly Shannon is always entertaining, and Leelee Sobieski did a great job as a tortured brain. Some parts were actually painful to watch, reminding me of high school. Even though I thankfully didn't get made fun of, it made my heart ache for those who do. Movies like this are actually good for children to see--my daughter made several observations about the cruelty of some of the students and how wrong it was. This movie is appropriate for anyone and a good way to while away 2 hours. If there's ever a time you want to see a lighthearted little movie with a happy ending where you don't have to think very much, then this is definitely a consideration.\", \"Drew Barrymore gets second chance at high school, on undercover assignment as newspaper reporter. In flashbacks, we see that the first time around was, to put it mildly, a major disaster. David Arquette is amusing in modest role as Drew's brother, who also enrolls to help out sis. Lots of subplots endanger but never overwhelm simple charm of movie. Drew keeps making her niche as major innocent-sexy light comic actress.\", \"I thought this movie was great, not only because of it's storyline but because it was portrayed greatly by the excellent cast. I read that Drew Barrymore wasn't exceptional as Josie Geller because she is beautiful. Yes she maybe but in the movie she played outside herself, which brought on a plain girl searching for who she is in the world. The story is sweet and definitely for the hopeless romantics out there, I for sure am. David Arquette is mad as her brother Rob, and Michael Vartan is gorgeous as Sam Coulson. Leelee Sobieski did an excellent job as her mate Aldys, someone who wasn't afraid to be herself. I think this movie should get more credit rather than being branded as a \\\"teeny boppy\\\" flick\", \"This movie may superficially appear to be flaky and for teenie-boppers. It seems to be the stereotypical high school movie. But in fact, it takes an honest and touching look at the high school experience. It doesn't propose some unrealistic ending where the geeks and the popular kids reconcile. It doesn't change what happened in adolescence; it just attempts to reckon with it. This is a really great, fun, heart-warming movie, good for teens and for those who can still remember being one...\", \"This movie turned out to be pretty much what I expected. Of course it's sappy, of course it's predictable. We all know the fairytale. But knowing that when you go to watch it, it's enjoyable enough to watch. It was funny and sweet. I did find it annoying that they showed geeks as either kids who didn't wash there hair or kids who loved math and joined clubs about math and wore T-shirts about math. I was an outcast in high school and I didn't do these things. It goes much deeper than that. Having to do with many things, some of that being how much money your family has, how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness and how mean you are willing to be to other kids. Anyway, I won't get into it. I don't agree with other opinions that Drew isn't convincing as a geek. With braces, no make-up and unwashed hair, I don't think too many people would be drooling over her. And even when she goes back to high-school and sheds those things. She's still wearing the \\\"wrong\\\" clothes, \\\"wrong\\\" hair and has the \\\"wrong\\\" attitude to be considered cool. And her other \\\"geek\\\" friend may be beautiful but it doesn't matter, where I come from, you can still be an outcast and be beautiful. (inside and out)\", \"'Never Been Kissed' is a real feel good film. If you haven't seen it yet, then rent it out. I am going to buy it when its released because I loved it. Drew Barrymore is excellent again, she plays her part well. I felt I could relate to this film because of the school days I had were just as bad. I thought the plot was well written, there was comedy and romance which are the type of films I love. I loved the ending because even though you know what's going to happen, it still leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting - anticipating!!\", \"There is little more that I would like to say about this movie than it really can touch your heart if you let it. Sure, it's surrounded by all the stereotypical Hollywood stuff, but I found myself actually engrossed in this movie and very interested in the outcome. I'd recommend it to all you romantics out there in a second!\", \"i love this movie. it focuses on both issues: reality and fantasy. reality because hey, we all wanted a date from that popular guy Billy. and some of us haven't been kissed yet, right? be honest!  another real issue is because of the pain people gain from teasing. and whoa, high school life. remember it? the fantasy is finding your true love, when you're 25 and still in high school. not really fantasy, but close enough!  although some parts are unbelievable, it was a great movie. there are no other words to describe such incredible work. and the story was wonderful. Drew Barrymore did a charmingly wonderful job, same as the hilarious David Arquette. the people who worked in the movie are all wonderful. didn't i just repeat that?  Never Been Kissed is one of the movies that the later generations should watch. it shows reality and some-not issues for people like you and me.\", \"Of course, really experienced reviewers who like stuff like Star Wars and professional crap will definitely drag this movie and say really bad comments about it. But really, it is enjoyable teen comedy with an awesome story and good acting.  Josie Gellar (played well by Drew Barrymore) is part of a news-reporting team and she has been offered a ('real') job - she has to go back to school and find out what teens are like these days. Well this goes alright, until Josie remembers her horrible time at High School and gets freaked out. But she's never been hip, never been cool, never been popular until now!  Sit back relax and enjoy with Never Been Kissed!  \", \"I saw this movie for a first time years ago, when it was still new and I was satisfied. It's a great Hollywood make-belief story for teenagers. However, it's not lifelike. As much as you would want to believe it, these stories never happen. That's why it is irritating to watch movies like that. They play with teenagers' minds, just imagine how many girls still in high schools believed in that magic and got disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my little sister or my cousin. The director should have spent some more time thinking about the plot instead of thinking about actors. Yes, they (actors) were good, but the idea isn't worth a 10. There are a lot of films about teenagers. So why don't we make a better one?\", \"I thought this movie was really awesome! One of Drew's best. I am also a fan of Michael Vartan so I thought he was so hot in this movie. Why all the bad reviews. I would want to watch this movie over and over again if I could. I also loved the ending. This movie clearly has shown a smile on my face! I was also surprised that James Franco and Jessica Alba were in it. I love them both so I also highlighted this movie. At the end, when Drew is making the huge comment about the truth it really told the truth of what sometimes happens in High School. Again, the movie was amazing. Defiantly a 10/10. Hope this comment was very useful to any IMDb readers.\", \"Josie is a reporter from a newspaper is set a task to go back to high school as she is going to be 17 again. .  As she is there, she remembers some really awful stuff thats happened to her the first time she was in Highschool as we see in flashback scenes.  In the flashback they show that (little spoiler) Josie was kind of a nerd in high school and was picked on a lot and one day the cool guy tells her that he is taking her to the prom, only on the prom night as she leaves her house she gets egged by the ass hole and his bitch. what a horrible thing to do (some will find this hard to watch as it so nasty and it will make you feel warmer to Josie).  I did not find this movie that funny but there was some really funny stuff in the office scenes a lot more funnier then anything that happened in the school.  This movie did have the perfect happy ending, as it did bring tears to my mum and sister eyes. The acting in this movie was not outstanding, it was good for the most part of the movie, there is some poor acting in some parts of the movie.  I going to give this movie 7 out 10.\", \"I love this movie so much. It always makes me cry. If you appreciate Drew Barrymore half as much as I do, you'll love this movie. It's got all the essentials I look for in a movie. It has good actors, good characters, good humor...a lot of heart-warming moments too. The flash-back moments when we see Josie in high school make me cry though. Every single time. I'm sure you'll like this one, don't judge based on the fact that it looks like a teen movie, even though it is, in a way, a teen movie. Sure, if you're a guy, and all you watch are hardcore special effect movies only in the top 250 movies of all time, then this isn't for you. But if you like romantic comedies you will not forget after seeing it, pick it up at a video store and enjoy: Drew Barrymore is great in this one!\", \"Never been kissed starring Drew Barymore as Reporter Josie Gellar is a sweet, extremely sappy and sometimes quite painful tale of a timid woman named Josie Gellar who though brilliant is quiet and shy and has never been kissed by a man. She is assigned her first major news story for the newspaper she works for-to go undercover as a high school student befriend the popular cool kids and get a scoop as to what really goes on in the world of high school. Only problem is Josie has never been popular. High School was in fact, a traumatizing experience for her as she was the recipient of quite a lot of teasing and cruel jokes. Josie grabs this assignment, as much to finally \\\"fit in\\\" as to get a scoop-what she finds is the major premise of the story.  Never been kissed is one of those movies that's so sappy and schmaltzy at times, particularly in a few scenes at the end that the limits of believability are sorely tested and many a cynic may not like this movie. It is however, very sweetly done. Drew Barymore is perfect as the bumbling yet lovely Josie-she breathes a breath of fresh air into the character and makes her appear perfectly realistic. I also enjoyed Leelee Sobiesky as the intellectual student who befriends Josie on her first day at the school.  Never been kissed has some really funny moments as Josie unravels in her frantic efforts to be cool. Example-the reggae bar scene.I also loved the appearance of Josie's brother Rob who also goes back and signs up as a high school student, the way that he helps to give Josie her \\\"dream\\\" of finally fitting in is just hilarious. At the same time, as Josie's woeful story of her original years in high school are shown in flashback it is extremely painful. You do not need to have had similar experiences in high school to Josie to be affected by her story-Drew is wonderful at making her character have a personal connection with the audience and we adore Josie from the beginning.  there is a lot of \\\"mean girls\\\" a 2004 release, in this movie but mean girls honestly was a lot grittier. Never been kissed becomes very much a romantic pic as Josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question becomes will they get together.  I liked this movie. It was really beautifully done in some areas. The movie is corny in some places yes, the last scene-realistic-no way-does this movie manipulate your emotions in the most obvious Hollywood way? Oh yeah yeah yeah baby! But it manipulates beautifully, there are some lessons to be learned here. The movie never preaches but manages to paint an accurate picture of what high school was like for a select few. I have actually met people who have had similar experiences to Josie-I've met people very much like all these characters-I think a lot of people simply don't know or can't conceive of the cruelty that can exist in the world of high school, and how hurtful it can be, but it's there. Not unrealistic at all. What struck me was Drew's speech at the prom, as she demonstrates the \\\"sheep mentality\\\" that can exist so prevalently -as Hollywood and manufactured as many think that may be, it was well done and very true.   I'm making never been kissed sound a lot heavier then it is, in truth this is a perfect movie to pick when one wants a sweet feel good light heartwarming picture. It's engaging, sweetly acted and just Rufus. I'd say check it out. 8 of 10.\", \"Never Been Kissed gives Drew Barrymore the chance to do something that maybe 70% of us would like to do. Go back to high school and make some necessary corrections. Actually the first time for me was bad enough and at my age I doubt I could pull it off the way Drew does.  Of course the reason could also be that once we leave high school it's like leaving a cocoon and we have to deal with the great big unfriendly world out there. I've known a few in my life who would go back and stay if they could. In fact there is a Law and Order episode which explores the dark side of this same situation. A girl looking young enough to pull it off, goes through high school at least three times and kills the person who stumbles on her secret.  With Drew though it's an assignment. She's a copy editor for the Chicago Sun Times who yearns to be a reporter. Publisher Garry Marshall who plays the part like Donald Trump took over the Sun Times gets this brilliant idea and just sees in Barrymore a young enough looking person to pull off the masquerade.   High School the first time was bad enough. Drew was not the most popular then and she's not doing better the second time around. That is until brother David Arquette also goes back to school and helps her over the rough patches.  Of course this raises a whole lot of issues for Drew, peer pressure from two sources, job and school. What's a girl to do?  Never Been Kissed is a light and charming comedy which to its credit skips over the opportunity to be crassly exploitive and gives us some good entertainment. Drew is very funny and sweet and her performance in moments of stress for her character moves nicely into pathos. Michael Vartan as her English teacher is the kind I wish there were more of in the education field and Leelee Sobieski and Jessica Alba play a pair of the empty headed cool kids that Drew tries so desperately to hook up with.  Still it doesn't inspire me to return to Midwood High School.\", \"I saw this when it first came out and have seen it several times since. I have the DVD. It's one of Drew Barrymore's best works and one that is worth seeing more than once.   Not being popular in high school was one f the things in the film I could relate to. I wasn't quite as tortured as Josie was (during her real high school days) or like Aldys, but I was never the go- to-the-major-party type either. The prom scene were the three popular girls fall victim to their own prank as Josie pushes way Aldys (the intended victim) is my favorite scene and I clapped when I first saw it.   I can still watch this movie today. it is excellent.\", \"I can't say that I embrace this as a Romantic Comedy, as I found little funny about it. I did find it endearing, entertaining, heartwarming, and terminally sweet, and while there were some witty moments, I found them more bittersweet than outright comedic.  I liked this one. Barrymore has grown so much as an actress, and it's always wonderful to catch her on the big screen, but this translates well to the small screen, too. In fact, on subsequent viewings, I like this one more and more.  If you're a fan of the Romantic Comedy, then you may be a bit put off by lack of comedic effect with this one, but if you're in it for the romance, it's definitely here to be found.  It rates a 7.8/10 from...  the Fiend :.\", \"Very sadly, I can relate to this movie, as I'm 17, and have yet to be kissed, so I really feel for Josie. It's been a while since seeing this film, but to write this review I re-watched it, and remembered everything I loved about it.  Drew Barrymore is a great actress, and this role suited her really well at the time. The chemistry between Sam and Josie was really good, and Michael Vartan was an excellent actor in this.  I loved the storyline too - as i said up there, I could relate, and it's rare you find a film you can completely relate to.  All over - I loved it. 7/10\", \"This is a truly hilarious film and one that I have seen many times. Drew Barrymore is brilliant as Josie Geller, as is David Arquette as her brother. You cringe with embarrassment at the thought of her returning to high school as the film is a reminder of what high school was really like! Her outfits are wacky and weird, and it brings back memories of those who dressed a bit differently! The gorgeous Michael Vartan was adorable as the teacher (wish there had been teachers like that when I was at high school!) and Josie's boss is fantastic. This is a film you could watch again and again, with a fabulous sound track! One for all those at school in the 90's to watch!\", \"I think this movie more than any other shows what a great actress Drew Barrymore is because she plays a ugly duckling in high school which is something I never imagined her being. A great flick with lots of laughs . I don't usually go for those feel good movies but I really enjoyed this one.\", \"I LOVED this movie. Not as great as \\\"50 First Dates\\\", but it's definitely a repeater, especially on a rainy day or with a group of girlfriends. Yes, the plot was \\\"cute\\\" and maybe even unbelievable, but what's so bad about a feel good movie. Drew as Josie and her romance with the teacher is so sweet and brother baseball wannabee adds to the movie's good feeling. With all the junk out there, what's so bad about a good movie the whole family can enjoy? Without being embarrassed while watching with your kids! Drew is an awesome actress that really seems to be unappreciated for the most part. This is definitely one of her best roles!\", \"There is a reason to call this a teen flick. Out of 100 possible points I would put it somewhere in the teens. It is predictable, the acting is horrible, especially the minor roles, and above all else it is super predictable. The ending is so hokey that I should have left early and maybe it would have passed. By the way, could you call the male lead a pervert? I bet if it really happened, someone in my school district would have said so. Finally, in the school I grew up in, even though the average class had over 1000 students, we could have picked out a chump like Josie as being a fraud and we would have singled her out of the crowd. My final word is save your time, when it comes on TV watch something better, like the stock quotes.\", \"I had nothing to do before going out one night so I didn't want to watch anything too heavy, I picked the perfect film. This must have been a gift to Barrymore from someone she slept with, the director Raja Gosnell has made nothing but silly crap and the writing on this one is just atrocious. In what high school can you register without a parent present and no proof of age or former schooling? They let kids all come to the prom with no shirts, in skin tight leotards, ass shorts and one girl was dressed as Eve wearing only fig leaves? She announces that she's 25 and her brother is 23 but there is no reprisal from the school, parents or lawsuits of any kind against the newspaper for fraud or spying? The newspaper boss wants to catch the teacher in an underage sex scandal but doesn't realize the teacher is coming on to a 25 year old so any case would be entrapment? They allow a camera in and record peoples private conversations with under age kids? I wonder if I hired my younger sister to go back to HS with a camera on her and filmed under age girls for my personnel use I would not get in some kind of trouble??? NAHHHH No problem. Didn't she have to take gym or go to the bathroom at some point? The secondary characters in this were like cardboard cutouts of what high school students are thought to be and everybody was a stereotype. Jessica Alba is just embarrassingly bad in this mugging for the camera at every chance. In what world do the parents not get suspicious when their uber-geeky daughter is miraculously asked out by the school stud to the prom? And they don't ask the guy inside to meet him like every other parent in history. If some guy in my school or any other school for that matter had conned my sister and thrown eggs at her in her prom dress he would have been in a body cast for the rest of his life. This movie is so contrived and predictable it's nauseating, and why at the end is everybody (the Alpo girls included) cheering for this chick when two days before they hated her????  DUMB, DUMB AND DUMB.\"], \"review_score\": [9, 8, 10, 10, 10, 8, 7, 8, 8, 10, 10, 8, 10, 10, 10, 8, 8, 10, 7, 9, 8, 7, 10, 8, 7, 10, 8, 9, 1, 2], \"review_category\": [\"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"pos_test\", \"neg_test\", \"neg_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 8.266666666666667}, \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0107688\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0093629\", \"total_review_count\": 2, \"total_rating_count\": 2, \"review_content\": [\"Unless I'm sadly mistaken, I rented A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 several years ago and there was a music video, I'm pretty sure which was called Dream Warriors, at the end of it, and I rented this one on DVD hoping that the video would be there because it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. It's amazing how stuff from the 80s is so funny now, but nothing is funnier than 80s rap videos. There was this rap group singing that song Dream Warriors on the VHS version of this movie after the credits, and they're all wearing like denim jackets with no shirt underneath and form fitting jean shorts that are all frayed at the bottoms like Daisy Dukes. What could make a rap group look more foolish I can't imagine.  (spoilers) At any rate, I was disappointed in looking for that video on the DVD version, so all I had was this mediocre installment in the Freddy Krueger series. The movie sort of starts off with the same idea as part 2, with the main character witnessing all kinds of gruesome murders and then sort of coming out of a trance and finding himself with the bloody hands. Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette) has a nightmare about the infamous house that Nancy Thompson used to live in, then runs to the bathroom, the sink's handles turn into Freddy's hands and attack her, and then she wakes up standing in her bathroom having slit her own wrists. From there, the movie turns into the usual mental hospital installment.   `Larry' Fishburne, tired of always playing the bad guy in his roles, was happy to take on the role in this film as a nice-guy orderly, stern but accommodating when the patients want to bend the rules a little. Not surprisingly, he turns in what is by leaps and bounds the best performance in the movie. Arquette later goes on to become an accomplished actor, but had not perfected her acting skills when she starred in this film. The characters in the movie are mostly all patients at the mental hospital that Kristen is placed into after cutting her wrists. All of them are cynical and uncooperative, almost none believing that they really belong there at all. Eventually, they realize and are able to convince the staff that they are all having dreams about the same man and it's not just some kind of group hysteria.  Heather Langenkamp has returned in her famous role as Nancy Thompson, this time grown up into a dream researcher as a result of her childhood experiences involving Freddy Krueger. Not surprisingly, she is able to quickly relate to the hysterical Kristen and the rest of the patients, since she had experienced exactly what they're going through. There are some interesting murders in this installment, and the technology used for the special effects have taken a huge jump. There is a gigantic, worm-like Freddy that tries to swallow Kristen whole, there is a scene where a television turns into Freddy and with mechanical arms he picks up one of the patients there for some late night entertainment and punishes her for sitting too close to the TV, but there is also an unconvincing go-motion scene where a couple guys have a fight with Freddy Krueger's skeleton, which has been rotting in the trunk of some car in a car junkyard. And one of the more groan-inducing scenes was one where Freddy attacks one of the patients in his dream (the one famous for sleepwalking), tearing the muscles and tendons out of his arms and legs and leading him around like a puppet. Ouch.  We get a peek into Freddy's past in this installment. Not only do we meet his mother, but we also find out the circumstances that led to Freddy being fathered by more than 100 maniacs. In fighting Freddy, the patients all band together and, in their dreams, use their special powers (most of which reflect their shortcomings in real life) to fight him. One student, bound to a wheelchair, is able to walk in his dreams, another has the hilarious powers of what he calls the `Wizard Master,' another is `beautiful and bad' (she has lots of makeup, her hair stands up in a foot-high Mohawk, and she has knives). Clever, but the movie falters when it has only one of the patients, the one who can't speak, not have any powers in his dreams until the climax of the movie, when he suddenly realizes that he can talk in his dreams (at just the right moment to save the day). His dream power was a little too obvious to have been left out for that long, but collectively, now you see why the movie was subtitled Dream Warriors.  Altogether, this is not an entirely weak entry into the series. The acting is pretty shoddy, but it's actually pretty good for a horror movie. Larry Fishburne vastly overshadows the rest of the cast, displaying wonderful acting skills early on in his career, and the movie is not simply a rehash of either of the first two \\u0096 a problem that plagues the Friday the 13th movies much more than the Elm Street films. The characters are never developed enough to allow for the later creation of much tension, which is why most of the deaths come across more as creative ways to kill off someone in a horror film than the tragic loss of the life of one of the characters that we've come to know and root for their triumph over evil. But then again, not a lot of horror movies take the time to really develop their characters to the point where you throw up your hands in defeat when they are killed, or are on the edge of your seat as they run for their lives. But it's important to note that the few horror films that actually do that are almost invariably the best ones\\u0085\", \"what kind of sh*t is this? Power rangers vs Freddy? It was watchable and as good as the first film in the beginning but from the part where the protagonists get super powers in theirs dreams, it started to become childish. This sh*t should have been rated PG or PG-13 rather than R. I expected to see some very mature stuff but it was only for the 1/3 of the film. The rest are for little kids. Plus it's focused too much on Christianity. I know Freddy's a demon but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons. Why does it always have to be Christianity? This is total Orientalism and filled with white men/westerner's superiority.

Somehow I found Nic Cage's character off-putting. Way off-putting. Then the plot didn't seem to make sense. Then by the end of the credits, the question came to mind: What point was this movie making? What was it saying? The answer, unfortunately, was not much, if anything. I really don't think this movie aimed at making a statement; unless it was \\\"your life is your life, you're gonna make the same mistakes no matter what, so keep your eye upon the doughnut, and not the hole\\\". Not a very profound statement, and I'm sorry, not profoundly made in this movie. The writing simply isn't that good. The direction is uneven, and is strangely overblown at times. Kathleen Turner was the best, and in my opinion, only worthwhile thing in this movie, and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre, unexplained circumstances, with a script that had no apparent statement to make.   She also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason I didn't enjoy this movie more. She states in her autobiography that Cage made a point of fighting his uncle Coppola's direction every step of the way, doing it \\\"his own way\\\" (not a good idea for a new actor), and putting on a goofy voice she called \\\"stupid\\\". His voice was annoying, abrasive and unnatural, and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy. I understand what he was attempting to do: play a young-guy \\\"hot shot\\\" who is not as hot as he thinks he is, setting up his own karma for future failure. But he goes overboard, the way he does it is abrasive, not effective, and if he had listened to his uncle instead of \\\"fighting the Man\\\", we would have had a more enjoyable film. Cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person, and those scenes are more watchable than others. But if I had to watch the movie through in its entirety, I would find myself wanting to pay someone in L.A. to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected (put-on) scenes.   The movie doesn't aim for a statement, doesn't make a point, is great to look at except when Cage is doing a demented Elvis impression (but without the voice), and is, ultimately, confusing and a waste of time. Given all this, Kathleen Turner surely deserved an Oscar in this flailing mess of a movie. I can't recommend anyone spending two hours watching this, unless you like Turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes. Believe me, you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes, and it will make just as much sense.   Kathleen Turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her Cage comments, which proves that she's strong enough to be honest, and to hell with other people's comments. You go, Turner! I'm not particularly a fan of this actress any more than I am of any other first-rate actor or actress, but her candor is refreshing. Cage's acting can be good to annoying, and here it doesn't work. At least, in this film, now we know why.\", \"Did Francis Ford Coppola have a brain aneurysm some time after directing \\\"Apocalypse Now\\\" that made him absolutely incapable of making a good movie?   You have to wonder what the director of \\\"The Godfather\\\" and \\\"The Conversation\\\" was thinking when he made this flabby film. It gives Kathleen Turner a starring vehicle, playing a woman who travels back in time and gets to redo her adolescence knowing all of the things that life as an adult has taught her, and Turner, the trooper that she is, does what she can with it, but this movie couldn't be saved by anyone.  It doesn't even have any style to it, and, given its director, one would expect that even if it had nothing else, it would have that.

I hated the first one but I had some hope that maybe the sequel would be better. I remember hating it worse than the first one! Seeing it again last night (Why? Damned if I know) all those feelings came rushing back.  The plot is basically a retread of the first--a spooky cemetary in the Maine woods has the power to bring the dead back to life. Naturally the dead come back as killers.  The first one was a cruel, stupid horror film. This one manages to be even crueller and much, much stupider. The script is horrible--full of unlikable characters and has an extremely mean-spirited tone to it. The movie opens with a young boy seeing his mother electrocuted to death and then cuts to a dog being put to sleep by lethal injection! That's just the opening--all through the movie there are vivid scenes of child and animal abuse shoved in your face. It makes you feel dirty and disgusted. Also there's a truly sick (and unnecessary) rape scene and pointless female nudity. And there's some really sick, graphic gore.  The direction is lackluster and (with one exception) all the actors are terrible--Anthony Edwards appears to be sleepwalking and Edward Furlong is just pathetic in the lead role.  The only thing that makes this film bearable is Clancy Brown's hilarious performance as a resurrected sheriff. But that's not enough to sit through this crap.  Cruel, sick, badly acted, badly directed, stupid script--to be avoided at all costs. This definetely does belong in IMDB's bottom 100.\", \"Naturally, I would hate this movie, because Eddward Furlong is in it. Sadly, that isn't the only reason this sucks. The acting is crap, the plot is forgettable and horror is cheesy. The fact that there is too much violence and not enough atmosphere ruins this movie (the first one sucked too).   I obviously wouldn't recommend this movie to any one with a sense of taste for movies. The actors are awful! (especially Edward Furlong) This movie really just seems like an excuse to desensitize people to violence.  In closing, this movie is pretty lowsy and deserves to be on the bottom 100. If you like movies with strong plots and powerful acting, don't waste your time with this.\", \"OK I'm 15 and i saw this movie one night after band.................i thought it was the worst possible thing ever i mean i have seen SO....many movies because my family are movie freaks so ya.......There was no music thats was it sounded like all together, the scenes were god awful and the whole movie was all together fake looking and u can tell it basically looks like a slide show thats animated and was photo shopped it was a disaster. After i had seen this movie i compared it in my head with the first and how the first one was based off the book i can see that it was extremely better in my eyes but to all you people that like it can you tell me what was going through your head when you saw this movie. Im not trying to be mean its just i don't get it.\", \"Let me start by saying that this \\\"movie\\\" is just pure rubbish. It proves that the creators had only one thing on their mind: \\\"How can we make as much money as possible with no effort at all?\\\"  The story isn't new, but that's OK. Someone or something dies and the ones who are left behind have a hard time to live without their loved one. But there is a solution. If they bury the death person, dog, cat,... on an ancient Indian cemetery he or it will live again ... as a zombie. A good director can do some great things with this, with or without a lot of special effects. But this clearly isn't a good director.  I know, from a commercial point of view a sequel or a prequel to a popular movie is very interesting. You can be sure that a lot of people will watch it. But why do you have to insult your fans with such an awful movie? Do they really think that a lot of gore, a dog with red eyes and a dumb zombie will make a great movie??? I sure hope not! Perhaps in the early fifties, sixties and seventies they could scare people with that kind of uninspired nonsense, but today they will have to come up with a lot better.  If I have to give my advice to someone who didn't see it yet: DON'T WATCH IT! There are a lot of good movies, but don't watch this one! You'll only regret it. Not because it is too scary or whatever, but just because it is a pure waste of your time! I think a lot of people will agree with me if I say that this so-called movie isn't worth much more than a 2 or a 3 out of 10.\", \"This is terrible.

This sequel is much worse and was pretty hard to sit through when I watched it for the second time.  Plot includes again a dead person who leads the characters to the mysterious cemetery from the first film, and soon they decide to try that wonderful idea of getting someone dead back to life with the \\\"help\\\" of that old burial ground which has been used by indians. What follows is human and animal zombies, couple of atmospheric moments and stupid gore. In other words, pretty lame a film.  At times, the film is purely ridiculous and cannot be taken seriously. But the character played by the great Clancy Brown (Blue Steel, Highlander) is funny to watch and pretty effective \\\"dead\\\" man..But I can't recommend this to anyone real horror fanatic because most of the time, this is stupid and boring. And the violence tries to be more brutal than in the first film but it fails pretty miserably. I think it is stupid to make splatter films when you have to keep the R in mind..And horror film to be scary, effective and atmospheric, the use of effects is definitely not a must. See the first film and don't rush seeing this sequel.  3/10\", \"When first saw Pet Cemetery II I wasn't expecting anything that would come close to the original, and I was right. First off the film isn't anything like the original the only thing remaining from the first film is the pet cemetery all other aspects of the first that made it good have been changed. The plot is basically a kid and his father move back to the town after the death of their mother/ex-wife, the kids makes friends with another kid who's dog dies and they bury it in the cemetery, well I think you know the rest. The predictability of the entire plot was just sad, I mean I could guess exactly what would happen next. The acting was average nothing horrible, nothing special. The film although directed by the person from the first was nothing like the first, whereas the first film used suspense and dark atmosphere with only very minor gore effects, The second film skips the suspense and atmosphere and goes straight for the gore, It seems like the director wanted to go in a different direction with this film in order to make it more action-packed, it really doesn't work. Overall this film ends up being everything the first wasn't, predictable, weak and just downright stupid. If your a fan of the original I wouldn't recommend this to you at all considering all the things you loved about the first have disappeared in this one.\", \"I have 3 words for this movie; I-Hate-It. I hate it! I watched this in our school field trip once, and it automatically sucks! This is a piece of crap slapped with a bunch of dead animals and freaks. First of all I want to give a shout-out to the film producer Ralph Singleton and Director Mary Lambert; \\\"Hello?! Have you ever heard of AA-NII-MAAL RIII-GHTSSS???\\\" Oh, I'm sorry... It's just this movie sucks anyway! Thanks a lot Stephen King! I'm gonna kick your @** for this, not really.  Sigh... And the story goes, the beginning sucks a lot; who would have thought of putting a real iron fence as a prop! They could have at least used... well... just like this movie, PLASTIC! Then the protagonist shouts \\\"Moooooooommm!\\\" Several times... what a Drama Queen! Yeah it's gay. A little later in the vet, a bunch kitties were sent... blah... blah... blah... then the protagonist's friend came in with a Siberian Husky (Hey, I like that dog!). Then, a few minutes later, the kitties turned into shrapnel, poom! Kitty go bye bye! A few more minutes, the dog was shot dead by that freak police officer. The dog is then buried, a little later, freaky police officer turned into freakier police officer after being bit by a zombie dog... ooh... ah... scary... Not!  A few more minutes later... This the worst part I've seen and I want to kill them! Those harmless bunnies are torn apart and turned into dinner, I thought those things hanging in the cage were a bunch of stuffed toys, turns out to be rabbits! W.T.F.?! Gah! Only an d-bag would do that! At the near end the ghost mother shouted \\\"blah... blah... (I forgot) Dead is better! Dead is better! Oh, God!\\\" Oh, shut up b****! At the end the father and his son went off, away from that scumbag town! And the last part, showing the characters faces at the side, yeah... It's a barf bag! What a Cornball!  By the way, my fictional nation considers this as the most controversial movie, because it's disrespecting! They shot a dog, which is sacred in the nation, showed some kittens that turned into shrapnel, mutilated a rabbit (so sad! They are a bunch of heartless morons!) and showed a taxidermized Pug (the most respected of all dogs in the nation) with an eye that doesn't fit, now it looked like the eye just popped off! My people are animal lovers! The Animal Liberation Front of Teryl (Teryl is my fictional country, I made it since I was in 4th grade, I'm in 12th grade now!) should have protested against this, and ban this for good!  The movie's story is crap, the acting is just cheesy, and the lines are lame! Indeed, I'm an animal lover, mostly dog person! If you're an animal lover like me, destroy the VHS, VCD, or DVD or anything that played this crap, burn it, shred it, just don't bury it in the Pet Sematary in Maine! Okay, that's a little drastic... just curse Mary Lambert instead, it's her fault anyway!  Overall I give this a 1 out of 10! That's it, I'm done!\", \"Simply put, this movie is awful! IT has nothing to do at all with the first movie, and lacks a plot- and a heartbeat for that matter. The first Pet Sematary is truly a classic and Stephen King would let Gage Saw his achilles' tendon (as he did to Jud) if he saw this god-awful sequel.  SKIP IT!! 3/10 (riding on a good effort by Furlong)\", \"Mary Lambert's \\\"Pet Sematary II\\\" of 1992 is an unpleasant and unscary sequel and only bearable due to a few cool gory scenes and some decent performances. The original \\\"Pet Seamatary\\\" of 1989 (also directed by Lambert) was certainly no Horror-highlight, and I personally found it to be overrated by many of my fellow Horror fans, but it was still an atmospheric and entertaining film that had many creepy moments. The sequel, however, is a vast disappointment for a Horror fan like myself, since it doesn't really deliver any creepiness or suspense.  After the death of his celebrity mother, teenager Jeff Matthews (Edward Furlong) moves away from LA with his father Chase (Anthony Edwards), a veterinarian. As luck would have it, the father and son move, out of all small towns, to Ludlow, Maine, the nice little backwater we all know from the first movie...  \\\"Pet Sematary II\\\" is a (boring, badly made) drama about the struggles of adolescents more than it is a Horror movie. There is simply hardly any suspense in this (probably because the screenplay wasn't written by Stephen King, as it was the case in the first movie), and many scenes that are meant to be creepy are, if anything, more funny than scary. I admit that there are a few entertaining and gory scenes, but that's simply not enough to counteract a boring plot and the lack of suspense. The only noteworthy performance is that of Clancy Brown, who plays the town's Sheriff, an arrogant and aggressive prick. Brown fits very well in his role, his performance is one of the few positive things about \\\"Pet Sematary II\\\". Otherwise, the performances are forgettable, Edward Furlong and Anthony Edwards were not necessarily bad, but I can't say their performances memorabe in any way either.  The first \\\"Pet Sematary\\\" was definitely no Horror masterpiece, but this sequel makes it look like a Dario Argento movie. \\\"Pet Sematary II\\\" has a few fun scenes, but, honestly spoken, there's better ways to waste your time. 3/10\", \"I enjoyed the first \\\"Pet Sematary\\\" and rented this because I wanted some cheesy entertainment. It won't disappoint if one is looking for cheese, but on most every other front it will. The main problem is that Edward Furlong, our protagonist, has virtually nothing to do. Clearly he was cast because of his participation in \\\"Terminator 2.\\\" While I find Furlong to be somewhat grating (the pubescent cracking of the voice and the eyes glowering under too-long bangs), he did create a coherent character in \\\"T2.\\\" Yet here he is given very little dialogue and exists to merely sleepwalk through scenes. I kept waiting for him to respond to his tormentors with some biting comment, or have some insight into death, but he is a cipher. If he had been a proactive character--at least as interesting as the bully and the abusive sheriff--this movie would have been an above average horror.\", \"While PET 2 features the same director as PET 1, it is far inferior. Essentially what we have here is a zombie movie, minus the thrills. A veterinarian loses his wife to a freak accident and ends up moving with his young son to the town that houses the legendary and mysterious pet cemetery. Before you know it, once-dead animals and people are once again walking all over the place, raising holy hell. Anthony Edwards of ER fame is the vet and Ed Furlong is his son. Edwards is boring and Furlong is unconvincing as someone who becomes obsessed with bringing back the dead. The one saving grace here is Clancy Brown as a sadistic sheriff who dies and comes back absolutely delighted to be undead. Brown carries most of the movie, and is loads of fun as he slaughters the living and generally wreaks mayhem. The rest is hogwash and the story lacks internal logic (for instance, Brown kills the town bully and then revives him, but why?). The gore is stepped up a bit from the original, but this is because there are more flesh-eating dead people walking around this time.\", \"...it might come back as a sequel that is even worse than this one. For the record I actually liked the first Pet Sematary. While not being the best book-to-movie adaptation, it had its moments. This one has none.  Premise: A son loses his mother in a fatal accident on a movie set. The boy's father moves to the same town that the Creed family died in. things start to happen when a boy loses his dog \\\"Zowie\\\" to a gunshot would by his abusive step dad who is also a sheriff. The boy buries his dog in the same Indian burial set and things get worse from there.  Opinion: This was one pointless sequel. At least the characters in the first movie had a method to their madness. The characters in this movie are just plain stupid. The acting is bland and the story is backwards. The characters who die and come back to life have more personality as a reincarnated corpse than they did when they were alive. How insane is that? Plus this movie leaves questions unanswered? Why would Gus bury Clyde in the sacred burial ground after he killed him? It makes no sense as is the son who buries his abusive stepfather in the same burial site. If you saw that you dead dog came back to life more deranged wouldn't you think your spiteful step dad would come back more psychotic than he originally was? I didn't feel an ounce of sympathy for that pudgy idiot when Gus killed him and his mother. Stupid! If you want a better horror movie from Stephen King check out Misery. That was a classic. Pet Sematary Two is just a rotting, flea-infested dog of a sequel that should have never made it to the cutting room floor.\", \"This is the most idiot and meaningless zombie movie I've ever seen. Pet Sematary I is a horror classic, but this is an A-bomb.  The characters' depth is non-existent, the movie is boring, the kid is boring, the bully is ridiculous and the sheriff was a zombie before he was dead. You begin to hope for some postal worker to assault and destroy that town. But no, probably even the postal workers of that town are boring.  The violence is gratuitous, not funny, and the final credits sequence with the faces of the people who died almost made me puke. That was the final blow: I lied catatonic over the couch, in true disbelief -- DUHHH...\", \"\\\"Pet Sematary II\\\" tried too hard. The makers of this film tried to be like Stephen King, and failed miserably. I sat through this movie with the worst feeling. It was so unrealistic in a bad way, and the violence was inappropriate. \\\"Pet Sematary\\\" was a work of art by the master, Stephen King. \\\"Pet Sematary II\\\" was a work of trash by some wannabe. The acting was fine, but they couldn't save the movie if their lives depended on it. The nudity was in all the wrong places. The doctor has a fantasy about his dead wife, and her head turns into that of a barking dog. It was sick, disgusting, and way too many people died. Did you notice how there weren't very many deaths in \\\"Pet Sematary\\\"? Well in \\\"II\\\", there were tons. Way too many. This movie was horrible. If you want to see a good sequel, see \\\"Scream 2\\\" or \\\"Scream 3\\\". I gave it a 1 out of 10.\", \"I have to say that Pet Sematary II was the biggest load of rubbish I have ever insulted my eyes with watching. I should have been forewarned with the bizarre spelling of \\\"cemetery\\\" -- why they didn't spell it correctly in the first place... I'll never know.  What the hell was up with the ending credits with all that sad music and pictures of the people who died? It's not a -documentary-, it's a pathetic excuse for a thriller/horror film. The acting was dodgy, the script was bemusing and the plot was utterly ridiculous.  The psycho zombie dog was mildly amusing, but I'm not sure it was supposed to be. What was the film trying to do? Was it a spoof of a horror film? It failed at an attempt to fit into any genre of film other than \\\"trash\\\". I found the entire movie to be contrived, boring and stupid, and I wouldn't watch it again even someone paid me!\", \"After witnessing the onset death of his actress mother in a most implausible way (what movie crew would use a metal fence with their actors near electricity?), child of divorce, Jeff (Furlong), is off to live with his dad permanently and must accept the fact that his parents will never get back together. Or will they? Director Lambert makes the returned dead a bit more interesting this time by making them more intelligent and cunning. Unfortunately this was primarily used as a means to portray a lot of cheesy and cheap \\\"shocks\\\" and even unexplained motives for the Gus (Clancy Brown) character. Gone is the endearment and tragedy of the original; substituted with excessive gore f/x and spiteful characters. Furlong, who managed to impress in his early roles with characters who had similar family of origin problems (Terminator 2, American Heart, Brain Scan, A Home of Our Own), doesn't do much here outside of sullen glares, cuss and cry \\\"Mom!\\\" (literally) a number of times. Overall cheesy fun for horror fans but a flop in the character and scare departments. Hard to believe Mary Lambert, director of the first film, is responsible for this major disappointment of a sequel to the superior original. The ending suggests a setup for a sequel. I suppose we can all feel lucky this franchise remained buried after all.\", \"This is a sequel that has no connection to Stephen King.

Yes, bad things do (and did) happen, but in general the people there are just like you and me. They have morals, they are not killing machines, they do not all do drugs. Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They happened far more infrequently than the \\\"hype\\\" would lead you believe. Oliver Stone has a knack for making movies that show the Vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath, but are based as much in reality as Star Wars. If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favour and learn the truth. Fact: the Viet Cong and NVA did far worse things to the South Vietnamese than ANY soldier in the US Armed Forces ever did. Fact: the soldiers in World War II treated the enemy far worse in general than the soldiers in Vietnam did, and they were WELCOMED when they came home. The fine Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint, no one could have asked for more from our soldiers, and it is a great disservice to assert that this kind of \\\"mostly true\\\" fiction is the way things really were there.\", \"Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so overdone it's laughable. While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a horribly skewed picture of the war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace. Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.\", \"I read one other review that expressed the view that Platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people, being killed, taking drugs and talking trash.  I don't agree with that because the film actually had more to it, but it a way, I can see what this person is trying to say: this had no real plot - which is a point i agree with.  It is self-indulgent Stone at his best. He really wanted to show, not only how war leads to death, but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive. Unfortunately, the film seems to over \\\"glorify\\\" this aspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne, grand-standing, Oscar-hunting \\\"let's create an enduring image\\\" for my liking.  The problem I have with Stone and other film-makers of his ilk is that they fail to understand this simply concept: depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is DOES NOT PROVE OR EVEN REFLECT ON WHETHER it was an unjust or immoral war. We have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with Iraq. In case you're missing the point, let me put it to you bluntly: if you saw how truly bloody the second world war was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers, would you think it was an unjust war? If that fact alone doesn't convince you that it was an unjust war, then why should depictions of the horrors of Vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that instance.   Personally, I do not support America's decision to go to war in Vietnam, but i certainly don't subscribe to the \\\"this war is wrong because people died and suffered\\\" theory. I don't think that motivations are always wrong by default, just because war in itself is terrible.  This says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big \\\"twist\\\" was a bit stupid. However, this is not Stones first oddball departure. Wall street was a magnificent film, up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful \\\"wrong turn.\\\" JFK is probably one of the few films Stone did that actually ended very well.  But it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around. And this is why i gave it such a low mark. It was virtually story-less and ultimately boring - unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy.\"], \"review_score\": [1, 1, 2], \"review_category\": [\"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 1.3333333333333333}, \"Playback\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt1682940\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Ploughman's Lunch\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0086122\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Point Break\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0102685\", \"total_review_count\": 4, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"aside from the visually stunning shots of the ocean and skydiving this film has some major fundamental flaws. the major problem was many of the scenes failed to make sense. for example when johnny is chasing the ex presidents in his car after they had robbed a bank why did he not call for backup to cut them off? thats the first thing any officer on any level would do. secondly i never understood how they figured out it was surfers committing the crimes. they claimed it was because of wax on their shoes? wax could get there by any number of ways. lastly, how did johnny know where the robbers were going after the final robbery? he was never told by bodie, in fact he deliberately kept it from him. don't waste your 2 hours on this, read a book.\", \"I wish the movie had not been so ridiculous. An FBI agent going undercover, under his real name, AND doing raids on more or less the same group he is trying to infiltrate? Insane. A group of 13 year-olds would take more precautions than these FBI agents are shown doing. There MIGHT have been a movie here. The agent, Keanu Reeves, is shown getting close to a surfer gal in order to get 'in' with the surfers; he tells her his parents died (which is a lie--they are still alive, we later find out, in Ohio) to gain sympathy from her, because he has found out thru records that her parents died in an accident when she was a child. This kind of thing brings out a type of remorse in the 'best' of circumstances. It is HARD to go undercover. That's why J.Edgar Hoover didn't even LET his agents go undercover: no way, back then. But the foolishness in this movie is too, too much. Too bad, because some of it is pretty cool. Altho there is a slip-up: there are no football scholarships in law school.\", \"Good directing and crisp editing can't save this mindless overwrought film. Keanu Reeves is his reliably wooden self as an FBI agent who maybe likes Patrick Swayze's bank robber/surfer character a little too much. I love Reeves line to Swayze near the end, 'You crossed the line. People trusted you and they died.' (sic) I'd add: 'And oh yeah, you broke the law a lot, terrorized a lot of innocent people, murdered a cop, kidnapped and almost had my girl killed and you've been generally an insufferable, pompous megalomaniac.' Then I'd have shot him in the knee and arrested him. But that's just me. Reeves lets him surf off into oblivion because the movie is really about the love/hate relationship between these two space cases.  All that aside, the story and dialogue is all nonsense and the acting ranges from adequate to bad tho Busey almost succeeds in making a character you could give a damn about. A nice film to look at but not to listen to.\", \"This is one of those movies that would have you believe that surfing is a mystical endeavor, allowing one to heighten awareness and become closer to if not one with the godhead nature. Instead of the leisure sport of ski bums w/ surfboards don't work and hang at the beach. Which is cool, but that doesn't make it some ethereal vision-quest.  Lori Petty can always be counted on to irritate without doing any acting and this is no exception. I think she wants to be feisty, scrappy, empowering - those things. She's done much TV and it shows: she releases her emotions by staring at the camera. She has 3 modes: self-righteous indignation when she's wronged; self-righteous indignation when someone else is wronged; self-righteous indignation with a little girl voice when she's willing to have sex. All by herself she managed to ruin \\\"League of their own\\\". Here, could there have been worse choice for a love interest?  The real shame is the plot & script. Kathryn Bigelow is way better than this: K19, Near Dark, Strange Days - all brilliant. But she was involved w/ schlock-/ fluff-meister Cameron then and he wrote the script.  Overall this was intended to be a heart-pounding, blood-rushing, edge-o-ur-seat action fest. This is accomplished by having Reeves jump out of a plane without a parachute and catch up to the bad guy. Where they macho-talk about who will pull the ripcord until they're just a few-hundred feet over the ground. They survive of course.  It's about surfer bank robbers. FBI agent Busey has figured this out and says \\\"They're surfers. Look at the evidence: they rob in summer only.\\\"  The robbers are meticulous and perfect in execution, except for the last job where the leader changes the plan without telling the rest of the gang and of course this allows them to be shot/ caught.  But it doesn't even end there: There's the no-parachute scene about; then Reeves tracks his man all over; then there's a confrontation where he lets him go to die in some big weather.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Predator\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0093773\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"This is a great movie....the movie keeps you on yur feet the whole way!

Predator is infused with elements of sci-fi, horror, and action adventure and primarily is the sole reason why it is still a beloved among hard-core action fans. The inclusion of mega star Arnold Schwarzenegger and vivid supporting casts definitely adds to that.  The best thing about this film is that there is hardly a single dead moment in it. Every scene builds on the previous one and raises the stakes; keeping the pace of the film on its momentum. The tension is initiated there among the characters once they discover the wreckage of the crash and the gruesome sight of the dead body in the tree. The fear of the unknown has begun and sustains throughout their hunt.  Not many films can capture such a rich tapestry of action, suspense, comedy and just plain old popcorn fun in one film. The special effects at that time were top notch and well deserved of the Oscar nomination and even today it still has the contemporary look and feel. The atmosphere of the film sets it apart from the other action oriented by being unpretentious and accepting at face value that this is purely action driven.  The ultimate display of creativeness of vivid imagination from the effects crew is the Predator when revealed in full glory. A sight to behold! The imagery has now become an instant classic in similar veins that did for the Alien creature.  Downright, the Predator is a thriller that entertains while being slick and fun with rousing tension.\", \"John Mctierman and company have laid claim to the word 'Predator'. They have created the ultimate hunter/killer roaming the universe looking for worthy prey and this time it's Arnold (Dutch), and his able military team. This movie is fast paced enough to please action fans but also skillfully creates suspense by keeping their stalker in the shadows so that the predator feels ever present and is just cautiously eyeing and selecting it's prey. Bit by bit it is revealed to us until it's full horror is unleashed in the climatic scene.  The casting of this movie is near perfection, except for Shane Black who was offered a bit part when he was not needed for screenwriting duties. Arnold is the ultimate screen superhero. He is seemingly invincible and his overbearing confidence makes his casting as a leader natural. His muscles, thick austrian accent and powerful name have helped him permanently claim roles as his own - Conan, the Terminator and of course this one. Without Arnold in the sequel, it was always going to pale in comparison. For the screen superhero it was obligatory to have an adversary from outer space. Only in this way was Arnold going to have to use all that he had to overcome the invader. This is the match - up that moviegoers will want to see - the world's superhero trying to save us from a threat from outer space. Although this sounds reminiscent of the 40's and 50's when Hollywood capitalized on people's fears of a threat from outer space, this movie far transcends those B grade movies.  His crack unit is composed of some of the most outlandish characters the action genre has to offer. There is Jesse Ventura, the loud and attention seeking ex - professional wrestler. His gun says it all - everything is over the top with him. Sonny Landham is the indian with a sixth sense. It is this contribution that adds to the movie's suspense - he senses the Predator and quickly comes to realize that the team is up against something stronger than them. This unnerves the others since Billy is always the calmest and is able to access the enemy and give his team the advantage. Then there is of course the seasoned screen professional, Carl Weathers. He is always in top physical condition and this along with his smoothness, is ideal for his role as the ex - ops boy who becomes a collar and tie agent - a job that requires different values and he now uses the men he used slog in the trenches with. This grouping together of such strong personalities must have created a very competitive atmosphere which would have translated into better performances. Notwithstanding this fact John Mctierman must have had a big balancing act on his hands.  Arnold's contribution to the movie was not just that of the leading character, he also recommended Stan Winston after the first Predator creation was curtly rejected by John Mctierman. His creation embodies all one could imagine that the alien predator could have. It has missiles, spears, blades as talons, camouflage, infra - red eyesight and can deftly move within any environment. Of particular note is how the predator looks. It is the personification of our nightmares. Our fears tend to exaggerate our monsters and they are endowed with unnaturally long claws, glaring evil eyes, excessive mandibles ending with unusually long teeth and they are of immense size and strength. This is spawned by Stan in his alien predator creation. Undoubtably he is the man best able to create these monsters that haunt us at night.  Although there are scenes that remind you of the 70's slasher flicks, it is never done for the sake of it. These scenes show us how deadly the predator is and how it can swiftly attack and disappear without trace. The fact that highly trained team members are being killed in this way makes the rest feel vulnerable to the point of cracking. Unlike these slasher films the acting is better, no - one is helpless and these scenes fit into the story and are not the excuse for it.  The climatic encounter is fantastic. Dutch uses all his capabilities to overcome the predator, but when facing his end the predator sizes him up as an opponent worthy enough to face unarmed. It had found a prey that by facing in unarmed, pure combat, it would prove itself as the true warrior. It's drive to be the ultimate warrior is it's undoing since it affords Dutch the opportunity to lead it to a trap.  Also worthy of mention is the powerful military soundtrack thus setting the tone for a meeting of two great forces where one will stand and one will fall.  \", \"'You know bro' whoever did this to you is gonna' comeback, and when he does I'm gonna' cut yo' name into him. I'm gonna' cut yo' name into him.'  If you find yourself struggling to find a good sci-fi action pick this weekend on your weekly trip to Dave's Video or wherever the hell it is you rent your movies from, allow me to make a suggestion. Why don't you try renting an Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1987 classic, Predator. I mean you cannot go wrong with that.  This is a movie I watch maybe once or twice a year. It has a few signature '80s action movie touches. There are the one-liners, all pretty good and every body seems to shoot from the hip. Also there seems to be a lot posing oil handy, which is a good thing I suppose as our team of skilled commandos just can't seem to keep their shirts on. Director John McTiernan wanted us to know, to have absolutely no doubt, that our heroes were absolutely, 100% badass. Well trust you me, we get the bloody picture. The films '80isms are not excessive though, and on the whole a little bit charming.  Predator is a sci-fi flick that starts out as if it were going to be nothing more than a standard action film. (I must admit there is a neat little scene in the beginning that lets you know that it won't be) It begins with the arrival of a crack rescue team at a tropical U.S. military installation in dark bodied Hueys. The team is lead by a man we will know only as Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenenegger). The arrival of the rescue team is truly great film-making. The scene essentially establishes the intrinsic toughness of our heroes and their cohesiveness as a team of shooters. They arrive on the island and man they walk like the own it. They don't talk. They move like a highly coordinated unit, speech is unnecessary for men such as these, they know what they are supposed to do, they almost know each others thoughts. These guys have been together for years. And we the viewer understand all of this from just few quite scenes and remarkably good acting. It's all in the blocking of the shots and the carriage of the actors and it is all perfect.  The teams mission: save three U.S. diplomats whose chopper has been shot down. Dutch thinks to ask why this Cabinet Minister's chopper was traveling on the wrong side of the border. 'They got off course.' Says Gen Phillips. The diplomats also seem to be carrying information mighty sensitive to the CIA, because Dutch and his team are going 'in country' under the authority of a guy named Dillon (Carl Weathers). He is an old friend of Dutch's but our hero is a bit uneasy about having his authority pulled out from under him. Dutch even delivers the most famous of 80's action hero lines, well a variation of it anyway. The line typically goes something like this, 'I always work alone.' In Predator the line is, 'My team works alone.'  This is all standard action movie stuff. Well done to be sure but still material we have all seen before. What is great about this stuff though is how well done it is. The movie was filmed some where in South America, and it looks like they are moving through a real jungle. This is jungle with a capital J. They are not on a soundstage and that adds a lot to the movie. It is also during this material that we see that there may be more in store for them than just guerrillas. I won't say what they find, but it is unsettling. The other thing that is established during this material is the way the team is really one unit. Everyone is important. During the rescue operation for instance, while we see them dismantling their opposition the camera doesn't just follow Arnold around, but it kind of keeps a running tab on all members of the team. My only real problem with these scenes is the way everyone is always shooting from their hips all the time. I mean it is okay for Blain (Jesse Ventura) he is carrying a big gatling gun, but everyone else? Come on! Just a minor complaint.  The rescue doesn't go as planned, and instead of affecting the rescue (the 'diplomats' are dead), they pick up a prisoner, Anna (Elpidia Carrillo), and have to hike twelve miles to their extraction point. It is at this point that things begin to go terribly wrong for our heroes. The team's skill at killing has attracted the attention of different kind of hunter. And one by one he begins to pick them off, until finally there is just the Predator, and Dutch. Moreover it is a Dutch with out many of his modern weapons. He has his knife, a couple of rounds from is grenade launcher, but no launcher, and his wits. This is classic stuff.  The showdown between the Predator and Dutch is quite a pay off. It is a tense game of cat and mouse, with the roles of hunter and hunted changing more than once. Predator is maybe not a great action-sci-fi movie, but it certainly is one of the most fun. Rent it and enjoy.\", \"Predator tells a tale of suburban commando's who trespasses into the vietnamese jungle where something alien is lurking.

The most powerful scene in 'Predator' is when Bill Duke together with the rest of the group stands in the forest shooting wildly all around the trees without knowing what they really are doing there!   'Predator' is similar to 'Hell in the Pacific' in it's motives with the same claustrophobia, and it has a discussion about the macho-ideal, which few seems to notice.

Some gory images in this one, specially that scene where the Predator takes the skull from a soldier. **##END OF SPOILER##**  Good Sci-fi movie, deserves a 9 out of 10\", \"Predator. Possibly the greatest monster movie ever made. I'll explain why. Having just wrote a mini dissertation on the film, i think i stand in good terms to give my opinion on this film. First of all, the plot to the film is quite complex. Dutch and his band of commando's are brought to a military base somewhere in south America, where they are given orders to rescue a team of cabinet ministers who have been captured in foreign territory. This is in fact a ruse, as Dillon, Dutch's former team member who now works for the CIA, actually wants Dutch and his team to go in and destroy a guerilla terrorist camp who have vital government information. Dutch, unaware of the hidden agenda accepts and the team, including Dillon are whisked of to the drop site (somewhere in south America). So, the film starts off with the genre of Action Adventure film. This quickly changes however with the introduction of the predator. It has no physical presence in the film at first, it just takes the role of observer. John McTiernan (director) created a stroke of genius when he let us see through the predator's eyes. This is where the genre of horror is added to the film as the monster stalks them from the trees.  As the film progresses Dutch becomes less trusting of Dillon as situations arise that don't fit Dillons story. Eventually, they reach the guerilla camp and so ensues a great action war sequence. The commandoes take over the base and Dutch quickly realizes that he and his team been set up by his own government. he challenges Dillon about it who admits that they had been set up, but says that they were the only people who get the job done. The scene between Dutch and Dillon is quite intense and this adds to the tension of the movie. They decide that its time to leave and begin their march to the pick up site. This is where the Predator makes a full introduction into the movie as one by one he picks off the members of the team. It's classic horror as each time the creature takes out a member, he reveals himself a little more. Each death scene becomes more elaborate as the film progresses. The remaining members of ther team try to mount a fightback, but to no avail. The monster kills of the last members of the team, predictably leaving a showdown between itself and Dutch. This is a great section of the film as the predator is finally revealed in all its glory. Dutch realises on escaping the monster that he can camouflage himself using mud and this sets up a interesting finale. They battle for a while using weapons until it eventually comes down to Man against monster. The scene where the Predator takes off the mask is one of the best in movie history. Stan Winston did a great job on designing the monster and it shows in the final scenes. The death of the Predator results in a mini-nuclear explosion which is a little unrealistic (as is Blain's ability to hold a mini-gun and all the ammo needed to fire it). At the end Dutch emerges from the jungle as the only survivor and is picked up by a military helicopter. The end to a great film. The film works because of it's multi-genre definition. It's a Action, adventure, sci-fi, horror, thriller, war movie with elements of western genre mixed in as well. its narrative structure is extemely complex. trying to apply Propp, Toderov and Branigan to it is difficult but do-able. The film is excellently directed, masterfully shot, with great detail given to camera angles, point of view shots and special effects. The Predators camouflaged effects are magnificent and add greatly to the mystery surrounding the creature. The cast all act very well and gell cohesivley. Schwarzenegger is surprisingly believeable as Dutch and this doesnt feel like just another Arnie flick. All in all its a great monster movie and easily competes with the likes of Alien. In my opinion it's a better film than Alien. It takes place on earth, so the threat seems more real. I could go on for ever about this film, but instead, I'll leave it there and wait for someone to reply with their view. Chris Tunstall (aka trickflipper)\", \"Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a Dutch the leader of a commando unit who must take on a sneaky kill crazy creature who skins his prey and uses their skulls as trophies in this bloody yet well made monster movie which starts of slow but becomes so engrossing and suspenseful you feel drained near the end. Good special effects and a sense of style add to the fun factor.\", \"One of my favorites!  John McTiernan at his best. I first saw this film back in '88 and it scared the hell out of me. Partly in due to its suspenceful plot and visual effects, and the fact that I was only eight years old in 1988.  Recently reviewing the \\\"Special Edition\\\" version released in 2002, on Region 2 DVD format. The two-disc DVD package of \\\"Predator : Special Edition\\\" is the most current up-to-date version of the film. Disc 1 features the theatrical release of the film in 1:85:1 aspect (enhanced for 16x9 screens). A rather dull but interesting commentary by John McTiernan, as well as interesting text commentary. Subtitles in 14 different languages, and an easter egg. Disc 2 features some excellent stuff such as featurettes, trailers, documentaries, etc. Interesting stuff!!  \\\"Predator\\\" begins in the fashion of \\\"Aliens\\\", space! But quickly changes to the classic Arnie like war flick (anything before 1987), and even resembles aspects of the second Rambo film. The Plot : Arnold and his team of special forces are hired by CIA agent Dillon (Carl Weathers) to rescue American hostages deep in the Central American jungle. While all seems to go well and is looking good, WE begin to see what something else SEES (which for an eight year old was a little freaky). The team is being watched from the trees by something invisible.  The team reaches the village where the hostages are being kept, they quietly blow it to pieces only to find out that they were setup by one of their own. Pissed off, Arnie & team decide to leave without a trace, or should I say a trace of their own words. WE begin to see (through its own infrared heat imaging vision) that something is stalking them.  As the team is trying to get to their pick up point they are being killed one by one be something unknown, and unseen.......... I'll leave the rest up to you!!!  \\\"Predator\\\" is a classic popcorn film, and one of the best action films of the Twentieth Century. It was the film that turn Arnold into a plausable actor. A fine performance by Kevin Peter Hall (he will be missed). My only wish that didn't come true is for a better sequel, that is a different story.\", \"When I first saw this film I had the feeling something completely new was achieved by the film maker. An Action Sci-fi movie with action scenes that are believable (humanly possible) but still with a mysterious, powerful alien that is slowly developed from a computer generated wispy creature to a real and frightening being. Yes, the alien has superhuman strength, abilities and equipment but remains believable. Yes, Arnold rolls his muscles but not too explicitly as in some of his other movies, besides he needs them all in the physical fight against the alien who is very clearly a size too big for Ernie. In summary, a fast, innovative Action Sci-fi movie so full with small detail that you can see it time after time and still discover something new.\", \"Being fully dependent to technology is a weakness. That's what Dutch and the predator learned. At the beginning, the human team made mistakes that cost many lives. Leaving all the human-made weapons and becoming one with the Nature wasn't a choice, it was an evidence.It was a better idea to focus on efficient use of raw materials than wasting time with predictable guns. Once Dutch understood the trick, the predator began to reproduce these mistakes. Dutch became invisible and the predator tried to blast everywhere as if he was blind by his confidence on his technology. To sum up my ideas : Nature vs Technology, Unconsciousness vs Rationality, Confidence vs Fear. To conclude, i would say that Dutch finally reached his distant ancestors' primal instincts for hunting and survival that made the human race competitive on the natural selection. As my title said, Dutch has gone back to the basics.\", \"Yeah, I know this is a low-grade simple story, one of those action flicks that oozes with too much testosterone.....but so what.? Every once in a while, it's a nice release to sit back and get lost in a scary movie set in the jungle. I don't know anyone who ever dozed asleep watching this, so it's not all bad. It's actually a fun movie.  Despite the moronic and unlikeable characters who uttered some stupid dialog, the movie gets you very involved and is one of the better pure-action movies I've ever seen. The jungle scenery is outstanding to view on DVD. This is a pretty movie for such low-grade material, story-wise. I watched it a second time just for the visuals.  The ending, with Arnold Schwarzenegger battling the alien, goes on too long. Had this film been cut to 80 minutes, it would have much better. Still, if you want a fairly short movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat with great suspense, without having to tax your braincells, this is highly recommended.\", \"Plot: A special strike force team is sent in the jungles lead by Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger), for what he believe to be a rescue mission. But come to find out they were sent to stop a small army from crossing tons of weapons into the country. After they destroy the camp they soon relies they were tricked and expendable. Thinking this is the end they proceed to the check point where the Helicopter will take them home. But they are then hunted down one by one by an invisible enemy. Then find out this thing isn't human and is a hunter of unstoppable and futuristic tactics never seen on are planet. A Hunter from another world!  My Spiel: This movie is absolutely one of my favorites. From a time I watched this movie for 3 straight months, for every day. Some days I watched it more then once. I had this on a terrible VHS tape. But for some reason having to rewind it and in the rewinding time span I wanted to watch it again and again. This movie is full of everything from blood/guts/bullets/knifes/aliens/war/soldiers/death. All those mix to make the true \\\"Guy Movie\\\". Granted this movie has it's flaws but come on, this is one of those ultimate badass movies where none of that crap matters. There have been tons of movies to try to duplicate this movie and all fail. I can't urge people enough to just watch this for what it is. The ultimate what the hell else could go wrong for a special elite team lead by Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger). That has already been tricked into doing a job, also in 115+ degree heat, and then to top it off a out of this world galactic hunter wants there bones for collectors pieces. From the attack on the base camp that they completely demolish, to the destruction of a square block of jungle with the mini gun scene. But this movie true message is the fact that Dutch is left to fight the Predator without the use of military weapons, but has to make his own out of the supplies and natural surroundings around him, which completely throw the Predator for a complete loop, or does it!  After screening this movie to many times to count I have come up with a conclusion about the end. I believe that Poncho (Richard Chaves) the soldier with the automatic grenade launcher, Survived at the end. Well I believe he was in the lap of Anna (Elpidia Carrillo) in the helicopter at the end. Because you can see the hair of someone laying down but no face. And the only one with that short of hair at the time was Poncho, and heck I think Anna came back for him, granted he did get hit by a huge log, but who the hell else could it be. Also on another note in \\\"Predator 2\\\" they talk about only two special mission force members survived and I don't know what this means to you, but Anna is no special forces member! This is truly something that has bothered me for some time. But this movie had given me days of satisfaction and a must watch for anyone who likes Sci-fi/Horror/Action. Predator (1987) Review: 10/10\", \"Having not being born when Predator came out, the first I heard about any sort of Predator was the Alien vs. Predator franchise. Therefore I was never too bothered about seeing this movie. And what I was missing out on! I want to start by saying that this is, alongside The Terminator (also staring Ah-nuld Schwazenegger) this is probably the action movie of the eighties. Nothing comes close to the suspense and pure brilliance of this film. The Predator and the lack of it visually creates a genuinely terrifying antagonist who ruthlessly butchers his way through Ah-nuld's elite squad. Ah-nuld himself is brilliant as Dutch, the ripped leader in a film strewn with brilliant one-liners (knock knock!), Ah-nuld was perfect for the role as someone fighting on the side of good rather than the evil monster-type role. Everyone else has a great part and the characters are developed well in the opening scenes, before they're mercilessly butchered. Overall, the action movie to see. Predator-10/10\", \"After starring as one of the most iconic and unstoppable villains ever in Terminator, it was high time that Arnie had a worthy foe to fight against. And he got way more than he bargained for with the Predator.  Before his crowning achievement of Die Hard, John McTiernan assembled a group of seven muscle-bound commandos in the South American jungle and let them unleash hell on Latino, Russian and Aliens alike with an awesome arsenal of macho weaponry. This is definitely a boys' movie. Both Alien and Aliens - hell, even Friday The 13th - had a thing about two females going head to head at the end. How are us guys supposed to get a kick out of endings like that? Arnie plays Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer, the leader of an elite Spec Ops force. His team is called to duty by General Phillips (R.G. Armstrong) and the very suspicious Dillon (Carl Weathers) to rescue a bunch of government officials, who have been shot down in enemy territory in Latin America.  As soon as they arrive in the jungle something is watching their every move from the trees. And they get the feeling that things just ain't right. The first rescue team is found disembowelled and skinned. Same goes for their chopper.  None of them trust Dillon. He's up to no good. There are no cabinet ministers being held hostage, just a bunch of his CIA pals being tortured by the Russians. In no less than five minutes, all seven of them completely obliterate a rebel guerrilla camp. The CIA hostages are dead.  Dutch is angry and feels mighty betrayed. Dillon lied to him and their mission is over as soon as it started. All they have to do is make a journey through one valley to the nearest rendezvous point and fly back home. Not so simple when a high-tech, seemingly invisible, 7'2'', extra-terrestrial Rastafarian hunter is picking them off one by one and keeping their skulls as trophies. This predator is obviously a fan of the 1932 movie, The Most Dangerous Game.  In the same way that he created nervous claustrophobia around the Nakatomi Plaza in Die Hard, McTiernan floods the movie with an oppressive and twitchy atmosphere. Half of the film's ominous tone comes from Alan Silvestri's militaristic and primeval score, with pounding drums and lurking strings, indicating that the Predator's haunting presence is everywhere. He could strike from any corner at any moment. And he does.  Nothing Dutch and his men seem to do can thwart this enemy and in no time at all Dutch is the last one standing. He runs for his life with the Predator in hot pursuit.  The final act is no doubt the strongest and can even be viewed as a separate movie altogether. McTiernan ditches the lush, steamy jungle from the first two acts and completely turns it around into a strikingly Gothic, baroque, supernatural landscape. There is a subtext of primitive brutality winning over highly advanced super-weapons. And there is enough testosterone between Dutch and the Predator to fill 100 tanker trucks. Women, totally, need not apply.  Definitely one of Arnie's best and a landmark action movie. No doubt. Outdone only by the sequel.  Note: When the Predator rises out of the lake and tries to locate Arnie, who is covered in mud, he notices a monkey sitting on a log. Freeze frame the film when he zooms in and you will see a single frame shot of a man in a white vest with an explosion/lens flare behind. It looks like a shot from Die Hard (which wasn't made at the time!) and I have no clue how it got in there.  Weird huh?\", \"*Possible spoilers*  \\\"Predator\\\" is arguably the best of the '80s/early '90s action bonanzas. Well-conceived, psychologically taut, visually vibrant and deeply entertaining, it has aged remarkably well.   The direction, screenplay, special effects, and general production values of \\\"Predator\\\" are just as muscular and confident as its cast. Even when the movie slips into excess (which it frequently does, with gratuitous flexing, absurdly over-the-top firefights, and unabashed macho banter), it does so with such a boisterous swagger that you can't help but hop on for the ride. This is film-making at its most self-assured and unapologetic. Director John McTiernan has said he set out to make a classic popcorn movie, and he succeeded in spades.  The story is surprisingly thematically strong, and believe it or not, it owes that to the depth of Schwartzenegger's character--a monster-movie hero who's actually on par with the monster. Every action hero has to have his requisite humanizing moments--it's par for the course. Smiles at a kid, saves a puppy, blah blah blah. But Dutch's are more effective than any other instances I can think of because they are so believable and unforced. \\\"I don't do this kind of work,\\\" Dutch says indignantly after he learns his team (\\\"We are a rescue team, not assassins.\\\") has been duped into attacking a rebel camp on the pretense of rescuing hostages. It's really a great moment--a simple, unexaggerated statement of ethics--as tough as Dutch and his team look, they derive real pride from the fact that they are in the business (primarily) of saving lives rather than ending them. It's not shoved in our faces, we don't have to watch Dutch cradling a tattered child's doll in the wreckage or anything--it's just there. This crucial humanizing moment makes Dutch's struggle with the Predator all the more striking--he has to give in to that part of himself that he rejects early on in the movie: the aggressor, the killer, the hunter, the savage. He has to allow this part of himself to take over in order to survive.   The ensemble cast deserves kudos, too (especially Bill Duke in the performance of a lifetime as the smoldering Mac)--the film is much deeper and richer thanks to their spirited characterizations. We ACTUALLY CARE when these guys (who would be called \\\"side characters\\\" in most other action movies) are picked off by the malicious demon that hunts and haunts them. Again, the characterization is effective and feels genuine, which lends greater meaning to the central action of the movie. As screen writing formulas go, this is definitely not rocket science, and most action and horror films attempt it in some form or fashion, but surprisingly few do so successfully.  And, of course, the other star of \\\"Predator\\\"--the creature itself, is masterfully conceived and designed, both with and without the mask. It still stands (along with, yes, the Alien) as one of the coolest and most imaginative monsters ever put on film.  This is a very important movie to people (especially guys) of my generation--I remember re-watching it repeatedly when I was ten or eleven (probably too young!), totally fascinated and drawn in to the primal story of kill-or-be-killed. I can honestly say that this appeal has not dwindled one iota. If, like me, you grew up on \\\"Predator,\\\" I highly recommend picking up the new DVD so you can see for yourself how well it has stood the test of time. If you haven't seen it and have any respect for action films or thrillers whatsoever, check it out.\", \"Back in a time when the term \\\"popcorn movies\\\" actually meant something, Predator stands out especially today, mostly due to its high quality writting and top notch action. This movie never gets boring, as we watch the characters interact with each other, it brings to mind the feeling I got when watching the Marines from Aliens; a great feeling of comradary and gruff friendship. The special effects, while dated, in my humble opinion look better then the snazzy \\\"futuristic\\\" effects we are seeing today. The Govenator is perfect for the lead role in this film, he commands a certain respect both from the characters and audience alike.  The title character of the film is still cool and frightening by todays standards. The filmakers knew how to use the Predator makeup, they shadow it in as much darkness as possible, cover it in mudd and grime, which hides what could have been very obvious makeup \\\"guy in a suit\\\" effects. The guy who plays Predator did everything he could to add some life to the creature, to make people think he could stand up against Arnold in the end. Its really alot of fun to watch the Predator hunt these hapless soldiers, when just a while ago they were kicking ass everywhere they went.  As we watch the downfall of summer \\\"popcorn\\\" movies, its good to know we can still go back and watch something great like this film.\", \"Some will tell you \\\"Predator\\\" is another dumb '80s action flick. It's not. It's very different from anything else Arnold Schwarzenegger has starred in. First of all it begins as a standard Military war film, setting up the plot for about 45 minutes! It then morphs into a suspense-thriller/sci-fi film: Like some sort of Agatha Christie novel meeting \\\"Rambo\\\" via \\\"Aliens.\\\" It's quite intelligent and thrilling, not revealing the Predator creature fully until the very end. Part of the reason this film works, and the sequel does not (as successfully anyway), is the level of suspense and mystery surrounding the Predator.  Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers one of his best performances as Dutch. Granted, he isn't required to do much more than shed his upper-body clothing and look ripped, but he _does_ do more than that - I felt sympathy for Dutch, he seemed like a realistic character, and I forgot that I was watching Arnold Schwarzenegger. He has a few good one-liners (\\\"Stick around!\\\" being the cream of the crop along with \\\"Knock knock!\\\") but especially later in the film, his confidence stumbles and he turns into the flip-side of the typical Arnold Schwarzenegger action hero.  The sequel worked as a comic-book-style creature feature but the original \\\"Predator\\\" is a much better film than most people give it credit for, being the rare smart action film that is solidly constructed and worth watching far more than just once.\", \"In 1987, Arnold Schwarzenegger was solidifying his position as an action superstar with the releases of the epic Conan, the influential Terminator and the somewhat mediocre Commando that was still fun to watch anyway. However, that position wouldn't be fully cemented until the arrival of Terminator 2 in 1991 which forever raised the bar for the action genre.   But plain and simple, \\\"Predator\\\" is a staple for Schwarzenegger's profile. It introduced the ultra cool \\\"Predator\\\" to the world and changed the popular culture's perspectives on alien movies. But the movie itself isn't just known for the central character, like the crappy Friday the 13th movies that are only known for the murderous Jason Voorhees and his stupid hockey mask. But \\\"Predator\\\" is known for the movie as a whole, with a great simplistic plot, awesome characters and great action that will make people want to see this again and again.  The movie is a about a former soldier/mercenary named Dutch (Arnie) who has been involved in a lot of conflict and has since decided to settle down and be the leader of a rescue team. He goes to a South American country to participate in a mission that would supposedly rescue a Cabinet Minister and a few other hostages, but later on he finds out that he's been set up and it was actually a mission to destroy a rebel base that would've invaded sooner or later. And Dutch gets ticked off and he and his team try to escape the jungle, but they're then being pursued by an alien who \\\"hunts\\\" rather than kills. As the situation escalates, Dutch starts to lose his sanity and that's totally evident in the final showdown with the creature.  Like James Cameron's \\\"Aliens\\\" that came out the year before, \\\"Predator\\\" is shaped by it's excellent characters, Dutch is the great, silent leader who is somewhat broken inside from all the combat that he went through in the past and his quote \\\"If it bleeds, we can kill it\\\" is among the greatest. Blain is the totally cool tobacco-chewing, mini-gun-totting guy who spewed out 2 of the movie's best lines: \\\"I ain't got time to bleed\\\", and \\\"This stuff'll make you a goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus, just like me\\\". Mac is pretty much Blain's best bud and frequently shaves with his razor and without the shaving cream to show his manliness. Hawkins is the super-nerd of the group who reads comic books and occasionally makes some sick jokes about his girlfriend. Billy is the silent, no-nonsense spiritual dude. Dillon is the dirty CIA agent who was best pals with Dutch a few years back and then sets up Dutch and his team, which leads to their demise and his, as well. And finally, Poncho is the sympathetic, yet sarcastic soldier who connects with Anna, their hostage, during the course of the film. And these guys are great characters; and they each have their own personalities, which makes you want to see more out of each guy.  And of course, I can't forget about the \\\"Predator\\\". The high-tech alien that hunts other creatures for sport was a very creative and original idea. It also held a very intimidating presence and the special effects were very well done, especially the camouflage. And I'm still wondering how that managed to do that in 1987.  And last, but not the least, the action really stands out thanks to the direction of John McTiernan, who directed this right before he made \\\"Die Hard\\\". The scene when the team attacks the rebel camp is, without a doubt one of the best in cinema, since it shows each team member providing something in the attack, and it's not just one guy who acts like a one-man army and destroys everything in his path all by himself. Also, Dutch's confrontation with the predator at the end, which displays more prehistoric styles of combat with the setting of the boulder and spike traps. And this movie makes up the modern warfare action and the caveman action so well.  Any action/sci-fi junkie should watch this, and they will be HOOKED. And you will want to see this again and again.\", \"\\\"Predator\\\" is a genuine Classic. Action, Horror, Sci-Fi it's all there. Lets see for starters we have Arnold Schwarzenegger, on top form riding to the peak of his action status, leading a team of tough Commandos. Made up of a great cast including Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura and Bill Duke. They're on a mission to rescue Hostages from Gorilla forces but are double crossed by the C.I.A, stop there and you already have a great action movie.  But oh no, this film also has an Intergalactic Alien Big Game hunter equipped with plasma cannons, Stealth Invisibility and Thermal Vision. It would be so easy to imagine this film going nowhere if it where to have fallen into the wrong hands. You could really imagine a plot of an Alien hunting Commandos in the jungle coming off a bit lame but no, Fox thankfully had faith and McTierman had a vision. Fox's faith may have been down to there two previous unexpected big hits \\\"Aliens\\\" and \\\"Commando\\\" which you could possibly say this film is a hybrid of.  Film also benefits from being made in that 80s early 90s era where your action film could take its self seriously yet still not too seriously. One minute we see a fairly realistic use of of weapons and tactics the next Arnie throws a truck down a hill equipped with C4 and Jesse Ventura pulls out his M-134 Mini Gun and shreds some Gorillas.  The Predator it's self is a classic design, thanks to the genius Stan Winston, and in my opinion never looked better than in this movie. It looked slightly fake in Pred 2(Not a bad film too) and don't get me started on the travesty that is AvP. It could have been a different story if they had stuck to the big rubber turtle they had shot scenes with thank god Arnold himself suggested Winston.  I won't spoil the plot for anyone who's not yet seen it I just urge you to see this movie.\", \"This film will always have special place for me, as aside from being one of the best horror/sci-fi films of the eighties; it's also a huge childhood favourite of mine. Despite the fact that I've seen it dozens of times as a kid, I have only seen it once during adulthood; and that single viewing was more than enough to remind me what it is that I love about this film! Predator works as a macho action film, gory horror and intriguing sci-fi, and despite it's short running time of just 100 minutes, it somehow manages to find room for all three. The fact that it stars action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger ensures that the film will always be favourably remembered. He's not a good actor, but Arnie always manages to bring that extra something to his movies. The plot is deliciously simple and follows a group of commandos that go off into the jungle on a secret mission. However, things go awry when it turns out that they aren't the only ones with weapons there. Finding the skinned bodies of the last group of men that entered the jungle is about to become the least of their worries...  The jungle makes for a great setting for an action sci-fi flick such as this. These sorts of films tend to be set in space, so seeing the action down here on earth is different; and the fact that it's set in the jungle, with it's dense foliage, ensures that Die Hard-director John McTiernan is able to bump up the suspense, as just like in the Vietnam war; the soldiers are dealing with an unknown enemy. The atmosphere really is excellent, and the special effects help to create a futuristic tone, while the suspense builds and makes sure that the audience are on the edge of their seats at all times. Predator was released hot on the heels of the success of James Cameron's amazing 'Aliens' - but don't be thinking this film is merely a rip off following a trend, Predator has more than enough up it's sleeve to ensure that isn't the case. The action is great, and director McTiernan clearly knows what he's doing. It's fast and furious, and the amount of weapons on display ensures that the film is sure to delight fans of macho action films. The fact that the lead actor is a monster of a man doesn't exactly hurt the film either!   Now, Arnold Schwarzenegger may well be a terrible actor; but it doesn't matter because it's his screen presence, not his acting ability, that makes his performances what they are. At times he's cringe-worthy, but it's hard to deny his prowess when it comes to the action sequences, and that is all a film of this nature needs. Arnie isn't the only big man in the film either, as an assortment of muscle men, including ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura, and Carl Weathers; Rocky's Apollo Creed, among other B-movie actors, join him. The man himself also finds himself a very worthy ally, in the form of the movie's central alien. The Predator may not be as beautiful as the creature from 'Alien', but it's just as inventive. Here we have an extra terrestrial that isn't merely trying to breed, or to 'phone home' - but one that is actually there to hunt humans for sport! Aside from being ingenious, the idea also borders on frightening. The gore here is gratuitous, but never goes over the top and on the whole, Predator is a film that never really got the credit it deserves. It's mindless fun - but its damn good mindless fun!\", \"Watching `Predator', which is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best action movies, it becomes obvious why Arnold's recent return to action (`End of Days', `The Sixth Day) have all tanked at the box office. For some reason, Arnold's chosen to play men with a dark past in his recent films, men with a complex background . . . men with laughably bad backstories. His great characters - such as Dutch Schaeffer in `Predator' - have no background. It's not necessary. The second Arnold steps onscreen, you know it's time for blood and bullets, plain and simple. Not every moviegoers' cup of tea, to be sure, but it works. Unlike `End of Days' or `The Sixth Day', classic Schwarzenegger action films like `Predator' never insult the audience by attempting to explain the often threadbare plot. Predator is kind of a Zen-philosophy action film - the violence and cheesy one-liners just happen.  `Predator' is a fairly simple story; it's essentially a sci-fi version of `The Most Dangerous Game.' A group of American soldiers, led by Dutch (Schwarzenegger) and his rival Dillon (Carl Weathers), lead a full-blown assault on a group of South American revolutionaries. Carnage ensues. After wiping out said revolutionaries, an alien creature armed to the teeth with high-powered weaponry - the Predator - assaults the American soldiers. More carnage ensues.  Hey, it's not exactly Shakespeare, but thoughtful, well-written action movies aren't exactly common. `Predator' works as an action movie - and as a darn good one - because it's kept simple (thus minimizing the plot holes and the head-scratching moments), it maintains a high level of excitement, action, and tension, and it's cool. Schwarzenegger is larger than life as Dutch, pure swaggering testosterone at its best. Jesse `The Body' rules as Blaine, Carl Weathers is icily cool as Dillon. . . and so on and so on. Enough sarcastic, macho one-liners and brutal firepower fill the movie to make it a male adolescent snapshot of tough-guy heaven. The Predator looks wicked as well - Stan Winston outdid himself, as the Predator does look and move like a vicious being from another world, and not just some stunt guy in a rubber suit. The direction by John McTiernan adds the final piece to the puzzle; the cinematography of the jungle is appropriately hot, steamy, and claustrophobic, and the quick pacing of the film moves rapid fire between all-out action and the tension of hunting one's prey . . . or being hunted. Everything adds up to a simple, streamlined, first-rate action movie.  Again, not the most intelligent film ever made, but `Predator' is still quite good - it's probably Schwarzenegger's best pure action movie. (Not his best movie overall, though; that honor belongs to the excellent `Kindergarten Cop'.) `Predator' is a lean, mean, intense action flick from start to finish.   Grade: B\", \"First of all, if you haven't seen this action, suspense and violence extravaganza, you most certainly are not a true action movie afficionado. The immediate grabbing feature of this movie is its score, very imaginatively composed and created by Alan Silvestri whose other credits include the Back to the Future series and other gems like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The tempo and build up which the score lends to the film engage its viewers with feelings of fear and nerve wracking suspense for what lurks within the thick of the forest. Take note of Sonny Landham's comment;\\\"there's something out there,and it ain't no man.  The action is fast, furious and merciless. The commandos are killed off one by one, leaving Arnie, Carl Weathers and the surviving members extremely terrified and on the verge of breaking down. Note the heated arguments that some of the commandos get into with each other. There is very animated and fiery action in the beginning (assault on the terrorist camp) but as we are introduced to the true terror of the jungle (or should I say, outer space), the action takes a turn for the more insane eg.Arnie running away armed only with a knife and trembling in fear, almost drowning in a waterfall and thereafter, continually pursued by the Predator). All this followed by a half hour long jungle battle mano a mano with spears, rocks and fists and hall deafening yells by both warriors. Very, very fierce and macho stuff I assure you all.  I shall not go into the other intricacies of the film and will leave it to the curiosity of potential/virgin viewers to find out for themselves. \\\"Predator\\\" is essentially one of the few action movies that truly lives up to its name and delivers the thrills and spills in no small amount and at breakneck speed. True connoisseurs of hard action.....YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!! 9.5/10\", \"Consider that so many of the roles that Arnold Schwarzenegger takes on are so similar, including Predator, and yet this film is so much better than most of the others. I enjoy watching his movies just because he's such a watch-able guy, even in his bad movies (which are many), but I think the thing that really makes Predator stand out is its simplicity. The movie starts, the guys get dropped in the jungle, lots of blood and carnage flies across the screen, and the movie simply ends. No romance, no complex back story, no soldier struggling with problems in his past or even trauma caused by the horrible things he experiences during the movie. This is one of the things that made First Blood so good. It may turn out to be a movie about a lot of muscle-bound meatheads in the woods, but it doesn't insult the audience or try to apply complexity to a story that can't support it.  Interestingly, the movie features two eventual governors. Jesse Ventura even wrote a book which was released while he was the governor of Minnesota and he used his favorite line in this movie as the title. And the book's actually pretty interesting; there are some funny stories in it about things that went on while they were filming this movie. Arnold, on the other hand, is actually (and thankfully) given a relatively small amount of stupid one-liners, which are an idiotic byproduct of hard action movies that I've never really understood the necessity for. They don't reveal anything about the characters who say them, they don't add to the story or further the plot, and with rare exceptions, they're not funny. But I guess comic relief has to come from somewhere, and since complexity is not a requisite for movies like this, I can't really expect a lot of thought being put into the comedic content either.  I watched Predator having never seen it from beginning to end and having just re-watched the original Alien. I am currently in the process of re-watching both series', for obvious reasons. One thing that I notice about both of them is the way they take their time in introducing the enemies which, in both films, are aliens. Predator doesn't waste much time dwelling on the origin of the alien, we pretty much assume it came from a space ship that flashed across the screen at the opening of the movie. Alien, on the other hand, went into remarkable detail about where its alien came from. What Predator does do, very effectively, I think, is that it has the guys fighting some very human enemies, which allows the movie to later take its sweet time in having them realize that the new enemy is not human at all. This is also, incidentally, weakly rehashed in the sequel, using the secrecy of this mission and team as an excuse to have more guys who don't know what's going on.  The death scenes are actually pretty tasteful, given the genre. They are just gory enough to illustrate the violence of the enemy without being gratuitous. Just enough is shown to show how vicious the alien is, and there are some strange things done to and with the bodies that make you wonder about the alien's intentions or needs. The first deaths suggest vengeance if not some sort of ritual, but later ones suggest that the alien may be feeding off of his (or her) victims. Oddly enough, it is not until the awful Predator 2 that we learn that it kills for sport.  Yes, the movie occasionally gets embarrassingly macho, but the skill with which it is put together far overshadows any tough-guy goofiness. Consider, for example, the ease with which the movie switches from showing the guys hunting the alien to their realization that they are the ones being hunted. In some cases, this transition takes place during a single shot and with virtually no movement in the shot at all except a change in someone's expression. It is truly a fight between a group of predators, which we understand because they are human like us, and a single predator whose powers and weaknesses are unknown. It's not Oscar material, needless to say, but it's a great action movie in part because it already knows that.\", \"Predator is definitely one of the best alien thrillers ever made. It is one of my personal favorite movies. When I first saw just a brief part of Predator when I was about five, I was freaked out and scared to even watch the movie for many ages, but eventually, once getting older, came to like it. The Predator, played by Kevin Peter Hall, is a very realistic and believable creature for the 1980s, when this movie was created. I like how humanlike its form is, and how un-humanlike it is at the same time. The creature's four mandibles were a great idea for its distinct facial characteristics and the creature's roar is awesome, one of the best ever produced. This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Richard Chaves, Elipidi Carillo, Shane Black, and Sonny Landham and they are all believable in their roles and even add to the humor that this movie has. This is obviously the best of the Predator movies and still one of the most highly liked thrillers today. And let's all show respect for Kevin Peter Hall, who died a year after he had made Predator 2.\", \"With the release of Alien Vs Predator i decided to watch the original Predator movie today. I've seen Predator many many times since i first watched it back in 1989 and i love it each and every time. I think Predator 2 has a slight edge over this but Predator has a slight edge over Aliens BUT i think they are all extremely excellent films.  Just in case you don't know, it's about a big alien whose race lives to hunt worthy prey and Arnold Schwarzenegger's team of commandos are that such prey. The commandos are sent into a South American jungle to find some missing airmen who are being held by guerrilla's. They do what they got to do which attracts the attention of the predator who is hunting in the area. So the predator goes and hunts the commandos with the aid of his kick ass weapons and cloaking device. The commandos also have a female prisoner.  I think the whole sub-plot about the so called missing airmen isn't too important to the viewer but makes it possible for the commandos to be there. The entire concept of Predator is really clever and it certainly made me sit on the edge of my seat while watching it the first time. It is kind of spooky in a terrifying way as we don't see the predator properly for ages but see through his eyes which adds to the tension.  The effects are great, the acting is OK and the story is cool too. I really like the music and especially the spooky twisted jungle sounds that we hear when we see through the eyes of the predator. This is a sci-fi action movie that isn't just full of cheap explosions. It really does have great atmosphere. Everyone who likes sci-fi and/or action movies should like this. If you don't then your taste in movies suck! This in my humble opinion is probably the second best sci-fi movie of all time.  Alien Vs Predator has little of what made this so excellent so if you haven't seen Predator and thought AVP sucked don't think that this will. Predator is absolutely fantastic viewing. 10/10\", \"Predator is the classic action film. What makes it so unique is that the story starts off as a simple but exhilarating rescue mission; but then it suddenly switches gears and becomes a fight for survival for everyone involved. The genius of that! The cast is wonderful; Arnold as Dutch was very convincing and commanding, yet humbled and low-key in his performance. The only way you would know that he's the star is that his face is on the cover, he's the leader of the group, and he survives at the end. He was 'one of the crew' instead of a one-man wrecking machine like in so many of his other films; that was very nice to see. Carl Weathers turns in a good performance as Dillon, as does Bill Duke as Mac, Jesse Ventura as Blain and Sonny Landham as Billy. The whole cast worked very well together.   The one thing that still astonishes me to this day, 16 years later, is indeed the Predator. The special effects in this film was very much ahead of its time, the camouflage was pure genius. I still can't believe my eyes when I see the camouflage effects; it blows me away that even now in 2003 it could sit alongside the FX seen in TODAY'S films with no shame. I'm waiting for Fox to put out a special edition DVD with behind the scenes footage explaining how the Predator was done; from the effects with its sight and the beautiful camouflage, to the suit. I caught a little snippet of a behind the scenes feature on AMC or Bravo, and ever since I've been anticipating its inclusion on a new DVD (WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?!??!)   Predator is evidence of how action films should be done. A great story and relentless action, all progressing the story along. A timeless classic, one of the best films of all time.  **** out of **** stars  P.S. The 'forest massacre' scene is one of the funniest scenes in movie history!!\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Pretty Woman\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0100405\", \"total_review_count\": 2, \"total_rating_count\": 2, \"review_content\": [\"I have just given a 10 for Thieves Highway, I mention this for two reasons one to prove I'm not a git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night.  We all know pretty Woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all, they'll eventually get you. Pretty Woman for me does two things, two terrible horrible ghastly things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers lots of giggling, borrowing each others make up. You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a street walker Prostitute we're talking about here, has a great life, she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. My feeling is this 'happy Hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character, which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? If I make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place? By bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have, what a cop out, really really lame.   Secondly, 'Pretty Woman' insults romance itself, Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this 'lady' that is without his plastic friend, yep don't leave home without it, especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another, even when he first meets her it's the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limos over there, money money money, where's the charm? where's the charisma, don't mention that attempt at the piano please.  Girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most. Guys who like this film will not even have realized that old Eddy has less charm than a calculator, as they probably don't either so it wont have registered. More importantly anyone who likes this film will hate 'Thieves Highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject.  I'll finish on a song:  Pretty woman hangin round the street Pretty woman, the kind I like to treat Pretty woman, I don't believe you You're not the truth No one could spend as much as you Mercy  Pretty woman, wont you pardon me Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see Pretty woman, and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like me  Pretty woman, shop a while Pretty woman, talk a while Pretty woman, sell your smile to me Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah Pretty woman, look my way Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me..and I'll pay you..I'll treat you right\", \"The first time I saw this was when I was with a date, and she thought it was an awesome movie. I didn't.  The second time I saw this was last night on TV. It still sucks.  As a love story this sucks. As having Julia portray a street hooker, this is repulsive. To me she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels. She had no tough shell to her. She wasn't tortured, anguished, enraged, starving or anything else. Her \\\"HOOKER\\\" character was so flawed, like comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond. The two simply don't fit, no matter what they look like.  The ONLY cast I felt was worth watching was the 2 bitchy saleswomen, whom were excellently cast. They did such a fine job that I hated them for the few seconds that they were on screen. They had real definition, for the minor roles. OK, so the movie wasn't entirely trash...the two ignorant saleswomen saved the film.  Aside from those two women sales people, the rest of the cast...including the big names was just crap. Either everybody was an ass-kisser or had absolutely no reason to fill any dialog in the movie aside from just complimenting Julia Roberts or kissing ass to Richard Gere.  This was a movie about how when you walk around in high-heels and a tight skirt in Beverly Hills, people leer at you and guys who work in hotels gawk as if they just had a baseball bat struck to their face.  While in reality, the women who are dressed to the nines in Beverly Hills are hookers and prostitutes to a higher degree, but since they aren't wearing the gaudy Madonna looking jewelry or the patent boots, they can look down on the others who do.  The hotel cast was sickeningly sad to watch, and anybody who had any real character had less than a minute of screen time.  This is an insult to romantic movies, comedies, dramas and even to prostitutes who face wealthy customers on a daily basis with hopes of having their lives work out perfect.  The story is about Julia Roberts being PIMPED (yes PIMPED) by a multimillionaire in a business suit and limousine.  She is still owned, still told how to act, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. He is more controlling than a street pimp, but the folks at Disney/buena vista butter it up to make it easier to swallow.  Had Richard Gere been a black man with a gold tooth and an AK-47 at his side instead of an attach\\u00e9 case, this movie would be about how a woman has to struggle to get away from the harshness of prostitution. Same story, different characters will make a very different outlook.  Oh yeah, change the white man for a black man or Asian or Spanish, have the land business deal be changed to a deal of weapons or narcotics and the entire concept of romantic comedy is thrown away.  As far as I'm concerned, Pretty Woman is still trash, dressed with ribbons and bows.  I didn't like it 15 years ago, when I didn't understand it and was led by the Hollywood hype. I hate it now that i can see past the pretty decorations that is called \\\"love\\\".  This movie is NOT a romantic comedy. It's a story on how to control a woman as long as you have the means and income to do so.  This is an insult to strong women, weak women and women in general, as well as to my television screen.  Do I hate it? Yes. Does it suck? Yes Would I recommend it to you? NO...well maybe if I really hated you.  Will this review get posted? We'll see.

For me I always liked Andre the Giant and was happy to see him in this film but the rest of the characters were not believable and it actually looked like they were acting.

I went through a burst of nostalgia, bought a copy off eBay and then actually received/viewed/listed it back on eBay within two days.  My childhood, rose-tinted memories had told me that there were - somewhere - scenes that were good. Yet, somehow, those eluded me. As does the comparison (generally unflattering, but still...) with Star Wars. Both had people. And, um, special effects. But that's about it.  The Princess Bride did have a really cool name. And a Star Warsy opening sequence with 'something big moving in space', but that's it.  In fact, that opening sequence might be the only part of the movie that wasn't a thinly-concealed plothole. People meet. They fall in love instantly. Bad things happen because they have to. Then it turns into a scavenger hunt, as they just slip, snakes-and-ladders style, through an infinite series of plot holes, until they eventually reach the empowering conclusion.  The special effects were horrid, but, given the era, that might be the only forgivable thing about the movie. The writing and acting, on the other hand, well - no excuse. People have been doing those things for thousands of years. The sluggish pacing is fatal. Money has been spent, but the story just refuses to get moving. There's absolutely no reason to pay attention and no payoff for doing so. It only shows a certain kind of naff humor, so as not to sully the virtue of the bland hero and heroine; the kind of \\\"humor\\\" that only dorks who like the fantasy genre find funny.

Overall, the story is childish, the dialog is juvenile (\\\"She is alive, or was an hour ago. If she is otherwise when I find her I shall be very put out\\\".

The best day of my life was about to happen. To that time, my only Star Wars experience had been a few HBO showings of Star Wars. I hadn't even seen The Empire Strikes Back yet.  And boy, did that day deliver for my less critical eyes. Jabba. Big Rebel spaceships. The Emporer. A green-bladed lightsaber!! Wow! Since that magical day, I must have watched this movie hundreds of times. I can't even form an accurate estimate at this point. With those multiple viewings, I have of course observed that this movie - the REAL Episode III - does have its flaws.  Of course in the context of a Star Wars movie, those \\\"flaws\\\" are more like \\\"quirks\\\".  Millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980. In May of 1983, I had mine. And this was my Star Wars movie.\", \"I suppose JEDI is now chronologically to be considered the very \\\"last\\\" entry in the popular saga, and it's a very good one, as were several of these. I liked how directly this sequel took off after THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and I appreciated the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character(and also Mark Hamill, as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about the Ewoks, they weren't so bad. I enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods, and I felt there was a lot of well-realized emotion with this chapter. The ending (with some new additions, I presume?) successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy. I know many true Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for changes he made to the original films, but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what I didn't already know, I think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity. Oh, and, err -- Carrie Fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit.\", \"I know I know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome. I love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time I was impressed with Darth Vader turning against the Emperor I really stayed astonished. The anguishing sequence in that film was when Luke is tortured and defeated by the Emperor/Darth Sidious. He is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, eliminates his dark master. A nice sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised with all the vessels of the Rebel Battle ships and all Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race they brought on screen the Mon Calomari, the ewoks, the sullesteian (Lando's co pilot) and many more... Most of my favorite scenes are in that film:1-When Vader destroys the Emperor and is fatally wounded. 2- When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then it shows up Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw)(the greatest scene in Star Wars) 3- When LEia slays Jabba strangling the Hutt crime lord.  I personally like the script and the battle of Endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of Star Wars between Darth Vader V.s Luke Skywalker on the Death Star. Post-script: The scenes with Leia in the slave bikini are memorable. 9/10.\", \"As Most Off You Might off Seen Star Wars: Return Off The Jedi You May Knows Its A Good Movie But As You Might Have Seen On Video They M|might have a party At The end And They Just Probably End The Movie with the party with no a spirits or anything But on the original one (Live TV) When they are Partying But before i say more when Ben obi-wan dies in the Imperial Ship Or Death Star They Saw him Disappear And Yoda Dies From Either Old Age Or Internal Illness But because Luke killed Darth Vader (Real Name: Anakin Skywalker) When They All Are Partying At The end when Luke Or Someone Stops the Spirits Off Ben And Yoda Stands Starring At Him And Smiling While Another Spirit Appears Is its Darth Vader but not as A Sith As The Old Usual Selve off Him And Started Smiling with Ben And Yoda I reckon That made the movie ending a little bit interesting But the Producers or anyone should off made a spirit off Padme And Mace Windu And Other Jedis that got killed with Younglings Under There Arms in the back ground\", \"No, there is another !  Because every Star Wars fan had to have an opinion about I, II & III and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy, I will state the good points of \\\"The Return of the Jedi\\\" and a few corresponding bad points of the prequel. Of course, I loved the music, the special effects, the two droids, but this has been overly debated elsewhere.  What we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie : - A strong ecological concern - Anti-militarist positions - Fascinating insights about the Jedi Order and the Force - Cute creatures - Harrison Ford's smile - A killer scene : Near the ending, when Vader looks alternatively at his son and at the Emperor. The lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his Black helmet. And when he grabs and betrays his Master to save Luke, thereby risking his own life ! Oh, boy !  What is wrong in the prequel INMHO : - the whole \\\"human factor\\\" element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing - The Force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults, than about wisdom - Too many Jedis at once and too many Light Sabers on the screen - The lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot   By the way, if you enjoy the theory of the Force as explained by Obi Web (Obi Wen, I mean) and Yoda, then you should read a few books about Buddhism and the forms it took in Ancient Japan.  The magic of Star Wars, IMHO lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice, from a father to his son, albeit the difficulties. \\\"De mon \\u00e2me \\u00e0 ton \\u00e2me\\\", (from my soul to yours), as would write Bejard to the late Zen master T. Deshimaru.\", \"\\\"Return of the Jedi\\\" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling. It manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale, and does so very convincingly.  Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit. But the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in movie history.  Return of the Jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook: it presented an incredible conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in the \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\" to very convincing here), an exciting opening at Jabba's Palace, a masterful performance of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke finally coming into his own, the resolution of Solo and Leia's romance, and the extremely powerful final moments on the Endor moon.  Yes, there are slight annoyances. But they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to nitpick every single scene. It's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter.

The Second Death Star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi knight, returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia, now revealed as Luke's twin sister! They agree to lead the attack on the Shield generator on the Forest moon of Endor while Lando Calrissian leads the attack on the Death Star. Little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the Emperor Palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the Second Death Star.  Return of the Jedi is my favorite of the Original Trilogy. It's got action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic Acting, amazing fight scenes, and awesome music by John Williams. Mark Hamill is fully matured now into a Jedi Knight, gone is the naive farm-boy and in his place is a calm, relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy. Leia is still cool in this film as well as Han and Lando. 3P0, R2, and Chewie do their roles to a T while James Earl Jones still is cinema's greatest villain: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless Emperor Palpatine. The Action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty. John Williams's score is still cool and enhances the film by several levels.  Signed, The Constant DVD Collector\", \"I only wish that Return of the Jedi, have been directed by somebody else, I mean, there is far too much ewoks scenes, completely unnecessary. Besides this time our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as evil as before, and Yoda just dies.  But there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it.  SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack sequence. 3-The emperor (now that's evil) 4- The Speeders chase at the endor forest. 5-The Last Battle. 6-The Dark side seduction scene. 7-The return of Anakin to the good side of the force. 8- And the last celebration.  Some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes. If some scenes would have been cut, and another director was hired, this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5, but still is extraordinary. 9 out of 10.\", \"A very good movie. A classic sci-fi film with humor, action and everything. This movie offers a greater number of aliens. We see the Rebel Alliance leaders and much of the Imperial forces. The Emperor is somewhat an original character. I liked the Ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I loved the duel between Vader and Luke which is the best of the saga. In Return of the Jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the Empire finally falls. I also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills Vader's redemption and returns hi into Anakin Skywalker spirit along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives a sadness and a tear. The greatest scenes in Star Wars are among this movie: When Vader turns on the Emperor. Luke watches and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and...his father (1997 version not Hayden Christenssen). The next best scene is when Luke rushes to strike back Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending. I felt there was much more than meets the eye. And as always the John William's music will bring the classicism into Star Wars universe.\", \"This is probably the best of all of the Star Wars movies.   The starting point of the movie was almost like Episode IV--spacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place, where the seriousness of mobster Jabba the Hutt was getting even more serious. He ordered Luke to die in a basement pit by the bone-crushing teeth of Bantha, who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark. Luke's Jedi powers eventually finish the monster off. Adding to the sneaky rescue of Han Solo, who was frozen alive at the end of Episode V, Jabba was very angry about this that Luke was sentenced to die at the Sarlacc pit outside.  But all of the Star Wars \\\"good guys\\\", especially R2-D2, had other ideas...and those other ideas fended off Luke's execution; in the end, most of Jabba's soldiers died and Princess Leia was able to use the force to fatally choke Jabba to death.  Like in Episode IV, the Death Star in Episode VI makes its appearance. As I analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the Imperial fighters around the Death Star, the Star Destroyer personnel, I guessed, sped up the arming of the main laser, using the Imperial fighters as a diversion. The 20-25 Star Destroyers that lined up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the Death Star was fired in surprise. Once it fired, the rebel fleet's only hope was that the Death Star's deflector shield was going to be knocked out, and this affected Lando so much because he wanted to destroy the Death Star but he couldn't until the shield was taken out. And it was taken out with Lando's increasing impatience.  Like in Episode V, the Imperial Walkers make their menacing appearance with their twin cannons, killing at least one of the Ewoks...but the Ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them. For instance, Chewbacca, as well as another Ewok, was able to commandeer one of the walkers (and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers), and the other Ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers.  It is amazing what Luke could do with his Jedi powers on his Light Sabre, like, for instance, the scene on Endor where Luke deflects incoming laser shots from a Storm Trooper speeder bike, and using the Sabre to knock out part of the bike. Or, in a climax, using the Sabre to break off his own father's arm during the final Sabre fight with Sith Vader.  You probably know the Ewoks celebration after the Death Star was blown, complete with a short display of fireworks, drumming on the spoils of victory (e.g., Storm Trooper Masks), and Luke finally meeting up with Leia after Luke's own nemesis---Darth Vader, now dead, is burned on a pyre. The celebration include Ewoks singing but I think Lucas did not buy that--even with the strong respect of film composer John Williams.  On the home movie version, I think Lucas himself wanted a different ending. In addition to the celebration on Endor, he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets, including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the Sith. The Ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece. He probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the Death Star's destruction, balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies.\", \"When I think of Return of the Jedi I think epic. Yeah Ewoks were in there so what? They're an interesting add to the movie (not to mention they are similar to the Vietcong who were also able to take down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). Jedi is definitely more darker then the rest of the movies. Emperor Palpatine (portrayed by the amazing theater actor Ian McDiarmid) was one the best parts of the movie. Palpatine is so evil and vicious, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him . Speaking of Darth Vader, what an amazing end to such an iconic character. Vader is truly a modern day Greek tragedy and I think people can now especially understand and appreciate this after Revenge of the Sith came out. His redemption at the end was moving and really brings a happy yet bittersweet feeling to you. The best part was of course the special effects. It's amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with it's graphics. The scenes at Jabba's palace (Leia looks amazing in that metal bikini) and of course the epic three way battle at the end are still stunning to look at. In all Jedi's deep plot and emotional moments (primarily between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals the truth to Leia) and incredible special effects is a fitting end to one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history.\", \"I was but a babe in arms when George Lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world Saga chronicling the adventures of young Luke Skywalker and the notorious Darth Vadar but even today 20 years on I can appreciate the genius that is Lucas and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with. In A New Hope Lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky Princess Leia, the Rougish Han Solo and the spirited Luke Skywalker as well as that best loved of villains, the sinister Darth Vadar. In The Empire Strikes Back he went all out to show us Special Effects can add to a tale and managed to something no-one thought you could do on screen. He made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat. Return of the Jedi is a fitting end to a Saga that will stand the test of time.  When The Empire Srtikes Back ended with encasing of the lovable Rouge Han Solo in Carbonite to be delivered to Jabba the Hut and young Luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his Father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse. Vadar it seemed had won the day. How we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow? In Lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from Han's daring rescue from Jabba's palace to the the final climactic battle on the Death Star between Luke and Vadar as Luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a Jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his Father's soul.  Old friends like the smooth talking Lando Calrissian and the ever lovable Chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the Emperor himself ( played by the brilliant Ian McDiarmiud.How he missed out on an Oscar is a mystery.) desperate to turn Luke to the Dark Side even if it means betraying his apprentice Darth Vadar.All in black with his red eyes,ghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed Master of the events that unfold. His new and improved Death Star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the Empire's reign for good.   Lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted. We watch in excitement as Han and Leia attempt to bring down the shield around the Death Star from the forest Moon of Endor with the help of some adorable Ewoks ( who I really do not believe take from the movie at all. In fact I feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the Death Star) and hindered by legions of Stormtroopers and Imperial Officers. We cheer on Lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty Imperial Fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the Deatn Star to destroy it once and for all. And we watch with bated breath as Vadar and the Emperor attempt to turn Luke to the Dark Side while he in turn tries to turn his Father back.  But for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside Darth Vadar. For ROTJ is a battle of emotions and feelings. Vadar is caught between his loyalty to the Emporer and the Empire and his Fatherly inclinations to Luke. Never did I think that a mask could show emotion but some-how one can't but see the confusion and pain on Vadar's face during the final scenes as the Emporer turns on Luke. There is more depth and emotion to Vadar than I believed a villain, especially one more machine then man could have and that I think is what makes him so accessible. He is conflicted. The Apprentice as much as the Master. The Victim as much as the Villain. Without ruining the end too much Vadar's final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy.  So in conclusion what can I say. George Lucas is the master of the Saga. Star Wars is the most compelling and engaging Sagas I've seen in a long time and I have yet to see another Saga rival it. Return of the Jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending Lucas masterpiece deserves. It's action, suspense, romance, tragedy, redemption, joy all rolled into one and it's memorable characters, wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that Lucas can be proud of.\", \"After ''Empire strikes back'' ''Return of the Jedi'' is my second favorite movie from the Star Wars series.  Luke went to Tattoine to save Han Solo from Jabba. At the same time, the Galactic Empire is doing in secret, the construction of a new space station like the previous Death Star. If this station stays totally constructed, it will be the end of the Rebel Alliance. Both Vader and the Emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new Death Star,and they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedule.  R2 and C3po are inside Jabba's palace to send a message from Luke to Jabba,where Lukes pretends to negotiate Han's life. He gives R2 and C3po as a gift to Jabba as part of his plan. Jabba does not accept the negotiation,since he is using Han Solo as a piece of his palace's decoration.(Han still is frozen in carbonite) Lando is hidden as Jabba's guard and Chewbacca is also gave to Jabba by a reward hunter. When the same Hunter tries to save Han solo and makes him stay in human form again, we see that is actually princess Leia in a disguise. The problem is that Jabba discovers Leia's plan and takes her as his slave,while Han is thrown away in Chewbacca's cell.  Luke comes as a Jedi knight to rescue his friends. At his first try to kill Jabba,he falls into Jabba's monster cell (Bantha),but easily kills it. Jabba stays angry and decides to thrown Han,Chewbacca and Luke to Sarlacc, a big creature from the desert who stays 1.000 years digesting it's 'food'. Luke,Han and Chewie has success in scape again, and even Boba Fett dies when Han accidentally throws him in to Sarlacc's mouth. Leia kills Jabba and goes after Han,Luke and Chewie as well c3po and R2.   Everybody's safe again,Luke decides to go to Dagoba to complete his training as a Jedi,as well his promise to Yoda. The problem is that Yoda is too old and sick, since he already has 900 years old, and before he dies, Yoda says to Luke that he does not need more training,but to really be a Jedi, he must fight with Vader again. He confirms to Luke that Vader is Luke's dad, and that there is another Skywalker besides Luke. In his last moments, Yoda asks to Luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side, and to Luke transmit his Jedi knowledge to other people. When Yoda dies,Obi wan's spirit shows up to Luke and tells him that Luke's father killed his good side Anakin to become Darth Vader, and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith. Luke stays worried about killing his own dad, and says that he feels that his father still has kindness. Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leia, and says the reasons why Luke and Leia were separated since babies. He gives his last advice to Luke saying that if he refuses to kill Vader, the emperor will win the war.  At the same time, the Emperor says to Vader that he must give Luke to him when he shows up, since Luke is stronger than before, and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring Luke to the dark side.  Now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series,when the Rebel Alliance plans to attack the new space station, the '' Death Star 2'', Luke will confront Vader and the Emperor, and Leia, Han and chewie needs to turn off the 'Death star 2' power field, with the help of the EWOKS. (little creatures who looks little bears)  This is for sure one of the most exciting star wars of all!\", \"Thanks to Kevin Smith, a bunch of geeks are running around saying that Return of the Jedi isn't any good because it's actually fun to watch. And oh no! Muppets are involved! That makes it bad! Everyone liked Return of the Jedi until someone in a Kevin Smith movie made a negative comment about it. Now all of a sudden people people look at you like you have some kind of disease if you mention how much you like it. This movie is so much better than anything Kevin Smith ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it. This movie is good fun! It's just as awesome as I remember it being when I was six! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing Kevin Smith's opinions! His aren't correct!  And that Ewok song at the end ruled! I bet you people don't even enjoy \\\"Ewoks: Battle for Endor\\\"!!!! I'm going to set you all on fire!\", \"This film is to my mind the weakest film in the original Star Wars trilogy, for a variety of reasons. However it emerges at the end of the day a winner, despite all its flaws. It's still a very good film, even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments.  One problem here is the look of the film, which isn't very consistent with the other 2 films. I put a lot of that down to the departure of producer Gary Kurtz. The first 2 films have that dirty, lived-in look with all the technology and so forth. In \\\"Jedi\\\" on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned. This makes for a much less textured film. Also the creatures were excessively muppet-like and cutesy. At this point it seems like the film-makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself.  Another aspect is its lack of originality. Where \\\"Star Wars\\\" created a whole new experience in cinema and \\\"Empire\\\" brought us to alien worlds of swamps, ice, and clouds, \\\"Jedi\\\" lamely re-cycled the locations of the first film. First we are back on the desert planet Tatooine, and then we are watching them face ANOTHER death star (maybe the emperor couldn't think of anything new... but you'd think Lucas or Kasdan could). Also we have these ewoks, who really are just detestable made-for-mattel teddy bears, in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie-fight at the end of \\\"Star Wars\\\" if they hadn't run out of cash. It just feels like lazy construction.  The most unfortunate aspect of \\\"Jedi\\\" for me is the weak handling of the Han Solo character. Whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time, trading one liners with the droids. Instead of a real drama we're stuck with the lame pretense that Han is still convinced Leia loves Luke -- as if the conclusion of \\\"Empire\\\" where she confessed her love of him had never happened. The whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the Solo character was not part of this film's central story after his rescue. Ford, for his part, looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances. This is more like a 1990s Ford performance, bored and looking \\\"above\\\" the film itself. Fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes. Lando, an interesting character introduced in \\\"Empire\\\", here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle. Only Hamill, given an interesting development in the Luke character, is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character. Probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work. And to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters. Really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package. Ian McDiarmid does excellent work as well as the Emperor. The film would sink if he had been too far over the top (as he was at times in the new films).  Visually and in terms of effects work, other than the \\\"clean\\\" look of everything it's hard to find fault. Jabba is a very effective animatronic character, one of the most elaborate ever constructed. The space battles towards the end are very impressive.  Ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears. But on its own, it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and IMHO far superior to any of Lucas' later productions.\", \"first, i'd like to say that, while i know my share about star wars, i am not a fanatic. i do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp Rat has or the extended family of TK427. what i know is this: Star wars, all the movies(less so with episode 2 though), captured something magical. it's hard to say what, what button Lucas has found and boldly pressed, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. it's an idea.  How, may you ask? i shall explain. star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes, good vs evil. it does this so obviously, so profoundly, that literally any person from any environment can understand. Episode VI does the very well, concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father, yet also, with the addition of the prequels, reveals even more to the hinted back story. suddenly, it's Darth Vader at the front, and viewers realize that it's the story about Anakin, not just Luke. but even before 1-3, there was amazing depth to it all. it felt real, as if capsule fell from the sky into Lucas's lap, detailing a historical account of a galaxy far, far away.  Star Wars is definitely something far above the norm, and i must admit, whenever i see them, particularly this one, i feel very small. i feel as though i've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. i get a tingling feeling when i see them, a feeling that something, somehow, has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope.\", \"I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies. I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted. To me it seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound plot, the most suspense, surprises, most emotional,(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie. I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.  It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole. I have heard many strange reasons such as: a) Because Yoda died b) Because Bobba Fett died c) Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) Because Darth Vader was revealed  I would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely. First off, WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died??? If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die. Don't get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not Lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to be. His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie... You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fett's name!!! Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think... Secondly, many fans did not like Yoda dying. Sure, it was a momentous period in the movie. I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic. All the good guys can't stay alive in a realistic movie, you know. Otherwise if ALL the good guys lived and ALL the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon. Another aspect to this point about people not liking Yoda's death.. Well, nobody complained when Darth Vader struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope. (Many consider A New Hope to be the best of the Trilogy) Why was Obi Wan's death okay but Yoda's not... hmmmmmmmmmmmm.... Another reason I just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible. That is utterly ridiculous!! I can not believe this one!! First off, the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there. If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage. (Since you lived in the forest all your life I hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage) They had swinging vines, ropes, logs set up to trip those walkers, and other traps. The stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest. The only thing they had was their blasters. To add, it was not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves, they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest. I thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the Star Wars heros, the band of rebels, as well as the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain, that would have been a great upset. Lastly, if this scene was still unbelievable to you.. How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han Solo, Chewbacca, and the Princess, being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!! And not only that, the heroes , of course, always hit the Stormtroopers with their blasters. The troopers must have VERY, VERY bad aim then! At least in Empire Strikes Back, the Battle of Endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers. Don't believe me? Check out the battle at Cloud City when our heroes were escaping Lando's base. Or when our heros were rescuing Princess Leia and being shot at (somehow they missed)as Han Solo and Luke were trying to exit the Death Star.  The last reason that I care to discuss (others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here.) is that people did not like Darth Vader being revealed! Well, in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie. Luke was trying to find whether or not Darth Vader was his father, Annakin Skywalker. It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his father's face because it made it complete. By Annakin's revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side (in his helmet) and to the good person he was Annakin Skywalker (by removing the helmet). The point is that Annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about. In fact, that's is what I would have done in that scene too if I were Luke's father...Isn't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet?  On another note, I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse (even if it is better) that preceding movies is another reason that ROTJ does not get as many accolades as it deserves. I never go into a film with that deception in mind, I always try to go into a film with the attitude that \\\"Well, it might be better or worse that the original .. But I can not know for sure.. Let's see.\\\" That way I go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was.  I am not sure who criticizes these movies but, I have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me (except for one person that said that A New Hope was their favorite) that it is ROTJ. I believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading.  Bottom line, the Return of the Jedi was the best of the Trilogy. This movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes. There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful, exciting, surprising, or all of the above. For example, the emotional light saber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ was better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any day!!!  Finally, I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky, insignificant details (or see it as \\\"just another sequel\\\") to trash the movie such as \\\"This movie stinks because Luke is not in it!\\\" then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered unfortunately.  \", \"Return of the Jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series, and is a fine conclusion to the Star Wars Saga. With Han Solo imprisoned by Jabba the Hut and the Empire building a new Death Star, the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side, and only our favourite heroes can pull it off.  The Opening sequence, set on Tatooine, we see Jabba's palace, a pit of slavery and scum, and new home to Han Solo, as Luke and the gang prepare for his rescue, and with Luke's Jedi powers, they have the edge.  We also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end. Han, Leia and Chewy battle it out on Endor, desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the Death Star. The Rebel Fleet led by Lando, battle with the Imperial Fleet while they wait for the shields to go down, and Luke has a final showdown with Darth Vader. An Epic end to a Classic Saga, and it's only just of the pace of the first two.  10/10\", \"Despite the feelings of most \\\"Star Wars\\\" fans, in my opinion \\\"Return Of The Jedi\\\" is the greatest cinematic film ever created. Ever since the first time I saw it, it's depth, intensity, special effects, and moving story have overwhelmed me. The film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years. Filled with powerful action, as the climax of the original trilogy, George Lucas gives us a rousing finish of the \\\"Star Wars\\\" saga in \\\"Jedi\\\".  Film Summary (Contains Spoilers For Those Who Have Not Seen It)  After \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in \\\"Return Of The Jedi\\\". Darth Vader, in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted Death Star to oversee it's construction. The Emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the Rebel Alliance and bring young Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side. Luke, Lando, Leia, Chewie, and the droids all travel to Tatooine to rescue the frozen Han Solo from the crime Lord; Jabba The Hutt. After Han has been rescued, and Jabba defeated, Luke returns to Dagobah to find a dying Yoda where he learns the awful truth; Darth Vader is in fact his father. The rebel heroes regroup with the Rebel Fleet. Now joined by other species and races including the Mon Calamari the Rebels must make a all-or-nothing plan of attack to destroy the Death Star before it is completed. While Lando heads the space attack in the Millennium Falcon, the Rebel heroes must disable the Death Star's shield generator on the Forest Moon Of Endor. It is here that the Rebels happen upon the furry, but mighty Ewoks. During the the two part intense battle, a third battle must take place as Luke willingly delivers himself to Vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the Dark Side. In emotionally charged sequences Luke must face his father as the Emperor lures out his dark emotions. As young Skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of Palpatine, Vader turns on his wicked master to save his son's life.   Filled with a deep timeless story of good vs. evil, \\\"Return Of The Jedi\\\" is a spectacular, emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us.\", \"This final entry in George Lucas's STAR WARS movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot. However, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. On the contrary. Sure, it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times, but RETURN OF THE JEDI still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.  The first third of the movie, where Luke and his friends rescue Han from the palace of Jabba the Hutt, is a classic. Jabba, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too. It must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet, much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product. Actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of Jabba's court, including the intimidating, slavering Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster. It builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.  Things get a little bit slower around the second act, where Luke discovers that he and Leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of Endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks. Most of the complaints about RETURN OF THE JEDI that I've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures, in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga. I don't totally agree with that, although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should. However, their leader, Wicket (played by Warrick Davis) is a delightfully memorable creation, and watching how they handle the Imperial Troops' technology with their simple, natural weapons provides a nice contrast.  By the time we get to the third act, though, the pace picks up again, as we intercut between the Ewoks battle against the troops, Lando and the Rebel Forces launching an attack against the Empire's all-new half-completed Death Star, and Luke's final showdown with Darth Vader and the Emperor. The latter ties with the Jabba Palace sequence as the highlight of the movie. Mark Hamill flexes his acting chops once again as Luke Skywalker in these scenes, and watching him as a fully matured Jedi Knight makes for an unforgettable performance. Also, as iconic as James Earl Jones' voice as Darth Vader is, he is rivaled only by the shriveled, crone-like Emperor, played with deliciously raspy, frightening evil by Ian McDiarmid. The tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment, which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored.  The STAR WARS movies have always set standards for special effects, and the technical work in RETURN OF THE JEDI can easily hold a candle to its predecessors. The space battle fights are as exhilarating as always, and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout. Of course, given that this movie was made after A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence. The acting is classic STAR WARS fare; Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher all mature and deepen into their roles, and Anthony Daniels provides more hilarious moments as C-3PO. Frank Oz's Yoda only appears in two scenes, but he makes the most of it. And yes, there's also John Williams' music.  All told, while RETURN OF THE JEDI falters a little bit in the middle, the first and third acts deliver in style, making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever.  In 1997, George Lucas re-released the classic STAR WARS in digitally restored (and revamped) \\\"Special Editions\\\", which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements. Of the three, RETURN OF THE JEDI appears to have caused the most commotion with STAR WARS fans. Perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place (albeit funny if you're not so easily offended) \\\"Jedi Rocks\\\" musical number in Jabba's Palace, which, although technically amazing, does disrupt the flow of the film. However, I DID like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy. This DVD version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes (notably on Naboo, where we hear what sounds like Jar Jar Binks screaming, \\\"Wesa free!\\\"), and, in what is probably the most controversial change, Hayden Christensen as the specter of Anakin Skywalker in the closing scenes. Probably due to the intense (and unfair) disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone. However, if you're watching the STAR WARS saga chronologically (and contemplating about it), chances are you may react a little differently. Nonetheless, it is an issue that fans have raised, so it's probably best to be warned beforehand.  As nice as it would be to have Lucas release the original versions of these three classic films, he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the \\\"definitive\\\" editions of his classic trilogy, and, when viewing the STAR WARS movies altogether as one complete saga (as Lucas intended), it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent. The original films will always be engraved in our memories, but these new incarnations are just as much fun, if one can give them a chance.\", \"After \\\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\\" redefined science fiction, and \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" redefined \\\"Star Wars\\\", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job. The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war. There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor. When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion. This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader. It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them. There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well. With the light tone of \\\"A New Hope\\\" and the more sinnister tone of \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale. The Special Edition for \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it. Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense. Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved. It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film. A THIRD must-see for film fans.\", \"The last film in Lucas' saga is a lavish, spectacular-looking production. It is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but I think it is a notch above episode IV (and just a notch below episodes III and V). In fact, I think it is the third best film in the 6-part saga. As far as I'm concerned, it is still a grandiosely entertaining film. It is not a movie with a beginning, climax and ending; the film's mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind: bring closure to Lucas' universe. There is an air of finality attached to the whole thing, which makes the film a little too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. Also, it is a lot of fun. New characters are introduced and old ones face new, unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as usual) great comic relief. Leia and Solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and Luke is still a great character to identify with. Again, it is Luke's (and Vader's) inner conflict what gives the saga its backbone. Lucas' aggressive imagination is still very much apparent, and the film's themes of loyalty, hope, and redemption resonate strongly. I'm glad Lucas eventually dropped the idea of making episode VII, VIII and IX, because this film is a great bookend to a long, fascinating and captivating saga. Not a perfect movie, but fun in the best matin\\u00e9e style.\", \"Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.  None of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.  Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see.  In the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else.\", \"When it comes to creating a universe George Lucas is the undisputed master and his final Star Wars film is very, very good (and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga). Having recently seen Revenge of the Sith really puts this movie in perspective. The final battle seems even more climactic knowing what Anakin Skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the Emperor. It also makes the final battle between Luke and Vader more bitter considering the love he felt for Padm\\u00e9 and the love she felt for her children. Actually while the new films (especially Episode II) are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only. They make the old films seem even better.  Mark Hamill does an exceptional job in this movie. He really brings the changes Luke has gone through seem real. In all fairness I believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job. Harrison Ford is still good. However, you can feel that he has done Raiders and Blade Runner in between the two final chapters of Star Wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit. He adds more comedy (obviously inspired from Raiders) to the character which works brilliantly. In short Han Solo is better than ever. Carrie Fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable. Ian McDiarmid appears in this film and having seen Episode III I can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever. James Earl Jones still provides the voice for Vader and he is still very, very good.  In terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the Star Wars universe looks better than in either of the previous (two) movies but this was always Lucas' fort\\u00e9 so that is really to be expected. The final battle over Endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise. It was also a nice touch that Lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax.   The only thing I feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the Ewoks. These little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in. Besides I find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of Storm Troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery.  All in all Return of the Jedi is a very good movie but the fact that Richard Marquand is a less accomplished director than Irvin Kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant. Also George Lucas' stupid decision to add the Ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance.  8/10\", \"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original \\\"Star Wars\\\" film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first \\\"Star Wars\\\" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).  I can't review \\\"Star Wars\\\" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to \\\"Star Wars\\\" and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of \\\"Lord of the Rings\\\" or \\\"Star Trek\\\" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.  I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.  Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+\", \"I'm sick of people whining about Ewoks! True, they're not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they DID happen, so deal with it! Besides, they ARE cute, and I don't care if they're marketable. Yubb Nubb!  This movie always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end could not be better. I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way. So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. It's very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. He is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable.  I don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope. They all do so well. They are believable characters. Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. Fisher does a fine job being a female role model (I mean, come on! She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!). Harrison Ford - need I say more?  The music is once again brilliant. It's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts \\\"NOOO!\\\" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle. John Williams is nothing short of a genius! What an amazing man!  Already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I. I can't wait to finally see it in the theatres (CAN I WAIT???) and then watch the original trilogy yet again.  Bravo!\", \"Perspective is a good thing. Since the release of \\\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\\\", claims and counter-claims of just how Episode's II and III will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' Star Wars films, making them part of a cohesive whole, rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies. What the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films. This new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy: \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\". Often derided for its overly 'cute' factor, ROTJ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\". Indeed the 'cute' element of ROTJ, namely the Ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire series. Did George Lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities? Only he can answer that question.  This cute factor aside, the film is a brilliant full circle AND evolution of the saga. Following on from the conclusion of \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\", Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows his Rebel Alliance friends to Tatooine, his home planet, to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the space pirate turned Rebel hero who was captured by Jabba the Hutt for overdue debts.  Skywalker is a changed man since leaving Tatooine with Ben 'Obi Wan' Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to fight the evil Empire. Now swathed all in black, Luke's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn. His psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest. While he might aim to always assist his Rebel friends, he yearns for another chance to confront the evil Darth Vader again, despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the Dark Side and join Vader at the Emperor's side.  Early scenes in Tatooine are impressive, from Jabba's lair, to his floating palace and the 'almighty Sarlac' - an intenstine that lives in the sand. Lucas' CGI enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the Sarlac, making it look fake and overdone.  The battle scene on Tatooine is outstanding, and is one of the more memorable of the saga. Luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates Jabba and his cronies, proving his prowess as a Jedi is now almost complete.  When Luke returns to the Degobah system to visit the ailing Yoda one more time, the viewer is let down by Yoda's distinct lack of screentime. Undoubtably the star of \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\", Yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of Luke's destiny is played out on screen.  ROTJ really is Luke's film, perhaps even more so than the original. His journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with Darth Vader and his fate. The other Rebel characters certainly work in his shadow. The romance between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo is all but non-existant, unlike in \\\"Empire\\\". In fact only Leia's character is developed in ROTJ, Solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films.  Their roles are consigned to working alongside the Rebels to destroy an all new Death Star that nears completion. This time the Emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction. The Empire intends to crush the Rebellion once and for all, while the Emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful Skywalker to his side to work alongside (or is that replace?) Darth Vader. The Emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, less cunning than Governor Tarkin (Peter Cushing) from \\\"Star Wars\\\", more deeply psychologically dark than anything else. Played brilliantly by Ian McDiarmid, the Emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate.  All the other actors are well entrenched in their roles. Hamill surprises as the more wisened Luke, making his character's progression from whiny teenager, impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series. Ford's role is waring thin, as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films -- he was the REAL star of the first film after all. Fisher's Leia is more of a prop, at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about... Add in favourites like Alec Guiness as Kenobi, Yoda and the loveable Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast.  Despite the film's corny forest battle involving the Ewoks and the Empire, it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence: on Endor, in space and on the Death Star, each with very impressive special effects. The music, as always, is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance. Just as the 'Blue Danube' worked perfectly for \\\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\\", John Williams' score is as much a part of \\\"Star Wars\\\" folklore as light sabers and the Force.  Lucas left the ending open to interpretation, meaning there could have been more episodes made. Indeed sci-fi fans have created their own versions of Episodes VII, VIII and IX in their heads over and over again. ROTJ works when given a chance, and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series.  When all six episodes get to be viewed together, this saga could well be the best ever made. Is it already? The addition of Episode I changed the landscape of the series. This is why \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\" can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release.\", \"I noticed that A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in the TOP 10, but that this one isn't even in the TOP 100.  This movie has a bad reputation because of Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie:  -The Rescue of Han Solo from Jabba: This official wraps up the Han Solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in A NEW HOPE.  -The Emperor was Finally Revealled: Well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw The Emperor as kids.  -The Speeder Bike Chase: Alright, so this was a special effects moment. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films!  -The 3 Part Climax: 1) The Battle of Endor (Led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke Confronts his Father & The Fall of the Emperor 3) The Destruction of the Second Death Star (Lando's Moment)  -The Final Celebration with Our Heroes: Like I said, this movie gets a lot of crap because of the Ewoks but I think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other.  All in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the STAR WARS story.\", \"I very nearly walked out, but I'd paid my money, and my nearly-as-disgusted friend wanted to hold out. After the endearing, wide-eyed innocence of \\\"A New Hope\\\" and the thrilling sophistication of \\\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\\" I remember awaiting \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\" with almost aching anticipation. But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, I was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor, I call Jarjar Binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first).  From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba's lair, this \\\"film\\\" was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable, profit-making action figures as Lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards, the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky, that vile muppet-pet of Jabba's, the new and recycled cabaret figures, the monsters, etc., etc., ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. Fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection. The blatant, exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating.  Lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the Death Star from \\\"A New Hope\\\" and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. What an appalling slap in the face to his fans. I can't shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans: \\\"I've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking, putrid garbage that I could dream up, and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus, all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped, cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in, and I get a cut from every single one. It'll make me even more obscenely rich.\\\"  There may have been a paltry, partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off. I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool. But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total, absolute sell-out to profit.\"], \"review_score\": [9, 8, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10, 10, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 7, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 9, 8, 10, 9, 7, 10, 1], \"review_category\": [\"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"neg_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 9.166666666666666}, \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0073629\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Rocky\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0075148\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0096438\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Romeo and Juliet\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0063518\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Ronin\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0122690\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Route 9\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0140519\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Rush Hour 2\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0266915\", \"total_review_count\": 1, \"total_rating_count\": 1, \"review_content\": [\"The first one was the best.

My grandfather who is now 85 served in the war verses the Germans. I've had many talks with him and his war buddys and I can promise you that what you see in this film (and many others that are \\\"based on truth\\\") is purely fictional and shouldn't be allowed to even claim it is based on truth. And if it must it should have to give us a percentage of truth that it is based on, eg: based on 6% truth. Honestly, just take a look at the war on Iraq to see a current example of how the victors completely turn the truth on its head and sell it to the masses; who readily accept it as fact.   Schindler at the end of the film is seen giving away his watch and a few rings (last of his possessions) as to save a few more Jews. Well, truth is Schindler made off with A LOT of money in reality. He profited from the Jews slave labor just as much as they profited off his humanity. I'm not saying that Schindler wasn't a good man for saving the many Jews that he did, I'm just saying lets not go overboard with the exaggeration. And this is just one of the many liberties the director took with this story to spice it up a bit. Some of the scenes which were designed to shock the audience with brutality from the Nazis towards the Jews were so over dramatized and fake they made me want to blow chunks in my popcorn. I don't mind fantasy but for gods sake don't mix it with truth, especially when you have an audience which sadly seem to often refer to this film when they are in a debate about world war 2 or the holocaust, as if it was some kind of historical reference with any credibility.

He also did it in a very exploitative pandering manner...to the point of being grotesque. If you didn't learn from those 4001 holocaust films that the Nazis also exterminated gypsies, gays etc.... Well the Nazis wiped out a lot of other groups beside jews too. This sort of thing tows a very dangerous line...that it was more significant not that 6 million plus people were exterminated but that it was 6 million jews....according to the majority of these films and various holocaust memorials the gypsies and gays etc. do not count.   Where are the numerous memorials documenting the genocide that happened in this country? (native americans...also numbering in the millions) That would make a historically relevant film. You think perhaps if native americans had a very powerful militaristic state that is subservient to u.s. power there would be more native american genocide memorials? Probably. The fact that much of this comes from elite american jewish organizations reeks a bit of hypocrisy, since historically American jews haven't suffered at all at least compared to native and afro americans (and to even suggest to the contrary would be a joke). So how does this film function? One might conclude that it panders to American jews, exploiting guilt perhaps for their lack of sufficient suffering? If you are interested in actual holocaust history (one might be shocked that it has very little to do with american jews). I would suggest reading more serious, less pandering sources. 'the Seventh Million' by Tom Segev, an Israeli journalist, is very good...'the Holocaust Industry' by Norman Finkelstein is very good too.

It's a dream which is something that rings of pathetic story telling . We also get a cameo from Jay and Bob from the Kevin Smith movies which leaves a feeling of doubt that the producers we're getting a bit desperate in the gimmick department . The climax is somewhat watchable but is let down by the fact that Sidney probably didn't need saving after all and the finale was written just so the murderer could explain his motives .

Now watching it the second time I hope I can forget it just as easily as I had the first time.  It's about a couple who lose their son and buy a house out in the country to try and cope with their loss. The man is a writer and the woman is just a mourning mother trying to move on. They don't know the story of the house and how it has destroyed many other families that lived there before.  The woman quickly starts to see things, including messages telling her shes going to die soon. The husband seems to think shes just having a hard time dealing with the stress, but he doesn't realize he is changing too, for the worse. As time goes on the truth unravels and we watch as the madness and the fear strike.  At first the movie is promising, the big house has potential to make a good haunted house movie, the hallucinations telling you you only have a few days to die would be very scary and here it gives hope for a creepy movie, but as it goes on you realize its going nowhere.  This movie is a supernatural thriller not to be confused with a horror film. It is not scary and quite frankly its down right stupid.  The actors are all bad, there is no cool production values and it has worthless CGI at times. I would not recommend it to anyone. It reminded me in a very small way of The Shining, but just because you liked that one doesn't mean you will this garbage.  Save your time and stay away from this boring movie, its not entertaining in any way, you could do worse, but you could surely find something way better to kill 90 minutes.\", \"OK...this might not be the worst movie ever made, but it's close.  SPOILER... (Can you really spoil a movie that stinks this badly?)  Readers Digest version of the plot:  Grieving couple move into house that's been empty for 20 years. Wife starts seeing signs saying she is going to die in 7 days (hence the title of the movie). Husband doesn't believe her. She does research into the house and finds out that every couple that lives in house dies and/or kills themselves. She tells husband, he ties her up. She gets away and interminable chase begins. Sheriff who was present last time comes to a momentous decision and goes to help wife. Possessed husband is saved by wife saying \\\"I love you\\\", they get out...the house sinks into the swamp...the end.  Yet the house is standing again at the end credits.  I couldn't like anyone in this movie. The wife, who should have left early on, sticks around FAR too long, the \\\"loving\\\" husband is antagonistic and mean even BEFORE he becomes possessed, and the sheriff seems to be a wimp.  The movie defies logic in several places, and the plot is the derivative tripe that makes you laugh, rather than scares you. The acting is the kind of stilted over-acting you see in a bad high school play. The special effects (as little as there were of them) weren't very good. And you can just forget about suspense...What they meant to be suspense, just made the movie drag.  I gave it a 2 for a three reasons:  1. I liked the music. 2. The cinematography was pretty good 3.

The flawless filming stile, the acting and (Kubrick's all time number one skill) the music - make it THE masterpiece of horror. I watched the TV miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and I had my hopes about this when I got a hold of it. IT BLEW ME AWAY!!! It is far better than I ever imagined it. It starts slow (Kubrick trademark) and has a lot of downtime that builds up the suspense. The intro scene is a classic by all means and I watched it about 20 times just for the shear atmosphere it induces to the whole film. Also the film doesn't offer a lot of gore (it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless) a trend that I hate in recent day horror films. Just watch it!\", \"That's right. The movie is better than the book. Don't get me wrong, I love the book. But the movie is just so much better. This film has Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall at their best. (I haven't seen Scatman Crothers and obviously Danny Lloyd in anything else.) Some of the ideas used in this movie are better than the ones used in the book. But I already talked about those in my comment on the mini series. But, I missed a few. The film is shot at a better location than where the mini series was shot. And the REDRUM scenes are creepier than those in the book. So if you're looking for a great movie, get Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. But count on having nightmares every night for 3 weeks\", \"Why can't more directors these days create horror movies like \\\"The Shining\\\"? There's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all time.  So, the plot is fairly simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson)and his family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season. The kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls. What follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean.  This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as \\\"scary\\\". It's some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music. Music has been a major part of Kubrick's movies (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and he definitely doesn't disappoint with this one. The score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without it.  Finally, I must comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie. This is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe.  There will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one. R.I.P. Stanley.\", \"Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way. Jack Torrance is a man in his forties, married, with one child, and with a past of trouble and alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather, and there is a well-paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months; and Torrance, who was looking to become a writer, found it perfect. But, the manager advised Torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family. Even before they got there, his son Danny, who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future (shinning), knew the place wasn't good and didn't want to go. Once they installed themselves in the hotel, things started right but within a month, Jack began acting strange, irritated, and depressed. At this point, we know something is going to happen, but don't know when and how. Scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny, and someone who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later on, Jack started to see other people and immediately felt good with them, like if they were his family; among them the famous psychotic caretaker, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are \\\"intruders\\\" in the hotel. Obeying this order, Jack went for the objective and many of the most scary things I've ever seen happen here. The ending is spectacular and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute.\", \"Everyone should totally see this movie! It's freaking scary, but doesn't resort to lame \\\"jump-out-at-you-just-to-surprise-you-and-pass-it-off-as-scary\\\" things. It really is great. See this freaking awesome movie!!! The director is Stanley Kubrick, easily the greatest director who ever lived. Every single one of his movies are masterpieces, including this one. The Shining is about this family that goes to a hotel in the Colorado Rockies as caretakers for the winters, and get snowed in. Well, the house is haunted. The kid is psychic. The husband is easily impacted by evil haunted hotels, and...well...HILARITY ENSUES!!!! Not really. It becomes this gripping thriller where stuff gets thrown at the viewer from all different directions, and it gets scary. Not just the classic, \\\"Here's Johnny\\\" scene. It's memorable, but can't speak for the whole movies. It's one of those things where words don't explain it adequately, and you just gotta see it. So go on Netflix, and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT!!!!!!!\", \"The Shining is a weird example of adaptation: it has very little in common with the source novel, written by Stephen King, yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror master's work. This is due to two factors: Stanley Kubrick's masterful direction and Jack Nicholson's chilly acting.  Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, a writer who accepts to take care of the Overlook Hotel in Canada during the winter period, unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place: he claims a nice, isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book. Therefore the Overlook becomes the new home of the Torrance family: Jack, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and their five-year old son Danny (Danny Lloyd). The boy in particular senses right from the beginning that something's wrong: he has been told by the cook, Dick O' Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy, the titular Shining, which allows people like him and Dick to see flashes from the past and the future, among other things. Because of this \\\"gift\\\", the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in Danny, even though he is quite capable of resisting them. That is not Jack's case, however, as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife's affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts, triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break.  The Shining works as a horror movie because Kubrick, though having never worked on this kind of film before, knew exactly what was effective and what wasn't, hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths. King criticized the director for changing most of the story, omitting most of the Jack/Danny subplot (merely hinted at in the film) that led to the book's emotionally strong climax, and while his disappointment is valid, the omission was actually necessary: the novel dealt with redemption, albeit in an unconventional way, and redemption is a theme Kubrick, one of the most famous analysts of human decay, never had a soft spot for. What he is interested in is the mental, and subsequently physical, unbalance that threatens the characters, and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot (Danny's encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example).  Another criticism King raised was about the actors, especially Nicholson: in the writer's opinion, his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate Jack already was insane, thus undermining the rest of the story. Now, it is true that Nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning, but it is equally true that Martin Sheen (King's ideal choice for the role) probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as Nicholson's: from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal \\\"Here's Johnny!\\\" scene, it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part, and even though the TV version of The Shining from 1997 isn't bad the Torrance character is indelibly linked to the One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest star. As for Duvall and Lloyd, both add terrific support, the latter especially deserving a place alongside Harvey Stephens (The Omen's Damien) and Haley Joel Osment as cinema's great horror child icons. One might complain about Duvall being completely different from the book counterpart (blonde and beautiful) and not having much else to do but scream and run, but two things ought to be considered: a) back in 1980 the \\\"scream queen\\\" clich\\u00e9 wasn't one yet; b) rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera, making the book-movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from Wendy's eyes.  Irvine Welsh, the author of Trainspotting, once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work (and he should know, given the liberties Danny Boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen), yet that doesn't mean the movie is necessarily bad. The Shining proves said point to perfection: very little from the novel, approximately 5%, is included in the film, but in Kubrick and Nichlolson's hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest, most original horror pictures of all time, which really is saying something given the genre's current poor form.\", \"At times, this overtakes The Thing as my favourite horror film. While Carpenter's film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick, Kubrick's is more artistic, more thought-provoking, and probably scarier. It's one of the few films where I can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it. I try not to compare it to the book \\u0096 which I've only read once, a number of years ago, and which scared me to death \\u0096 because the two don't have a lot in common, besides the story and characters obviously. It's almost as if Kubrick was banking on people's love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening. And it that way, it's certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations ever made, as well as one of the greatest horror films.  What makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares, not the blood and gore, not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time. It's the destruction of Jack Torrence. Some people have complained about the casting of Nicholson in this role, saying that it's too obvious that he's going to go crazy in the film, given his past roles and his appearance. I disagree. We know he's going to go crazy \\u0096 since most of us have read the book \\u0096 and Jack's appearance only furthers this notion. But it's the way he acts at the beginning that makes us truly scared. He's calm, quiet, patient. He engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with his own family. And with a wife and son as irritating as his, it's a small wonder that he manages to do so. But once he gets to the Overlook, he changes. He becomes irritable, angry, on edge. The scene that always shocks me is when Wendy interrupts him typing, and he utterly loses it, telling her to \\\"leave him the f*** alone\\\". This is the first f-bomb dropped in the film, and it's a shock to the system. From then on, all bets are off.  Another thing I love is the multiple interpretations present in the film. We're never really sure if what we're seeing is actually happening. Many critics have noted that whenever Jack talks to a ghost, there's a mirror present, showing that he may as well be talking to himself. But what of the other characters? Wendy never sees anything until the film's climax, until she is given a tour of the hotel's many ghostly inhabitants, but she is well aware that something is wrong, while Danny connects with the place almost immediately. His psychic powers are not in question \\u0096 how else would Hallorann know to come to the hotel? \\u0096 but does he ever see any of the ghosts that his parents witness? It's easy to claim that Jack merely loses it, being trapped in a hotel with his family, and Wendy later does as well \\u0096 seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that \\u0096 but what of Danny? It appears that his body is taken over by Tony, but how do we know for sure? None of these characters are reliable witnesses. Hallorann probably would be, and he warns of the dangers in 237, but he's killed as soon as he arrives at the Overlook (a scare Kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel). And that final shot. Has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema? Has Jack really been there before? Or was his body merely 'absorbed' into the hotel? When talking about the acting in this film, any discussion begins and ends with Jack Nicholson. Shelley Duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history \\u0096 probably on purpose, to give Jack's character more of a reason to snap \\u0096 and Danny Lloyd is no better, but Jack is a powerhouse. Part method, part improvisation, he's simultaneously terrifying and appealing. For better or for worse, he's the character with whom we identify with, not the annoying kid or nagging wife. We all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season, be able to do whatever we want. Who cares if it's haunted? Of course, the technical aspects are terrific. Kubrick's long takes, strange angles, and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror. The use of colour, mirrors, long hallways, and every other motif only heightens this. And don't even get me started on that score. I don't know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting, electronic tune. Its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel, the mood, and the entire film itself.  I know King doesn't like this film, but King's input on cinema is nothing to brag about. As great of a novel writer he may be, his screenplays are terrible, and his attempt at directing is better left unnoticed. This is not a very faithful book adaptation, but it doesn't need to be, and it really shouldn't. Part of the horror of the film is that the viewer doesn't have the book to fall back on; there's no reassuring source material. Kubrick masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more. If only for that, this is one of the most innovative films in any genre. And it's got everything else on top of that.\", \"\\\"Nothin'. There ain't nothing' in Room 237. But you ain't got no business going' in there anyway. So stay out. You understand? Stay out.\\\"   Never has there been such a feat of psychological horror as this film achieves. This is the highest rated horror film of all and rightly so. Jack nicholson is a superb actor and this is one of the greatest performances in cinema.  Its about a family moving to an isolated and deserted hotel for 5 months over the winter. Then the father (Jack) becomes almost possessed by the horrors in the hotel.  Kubricks direction is nothing short then perfect. The tense tracking shots, agonising music, mystical messages and perplexing plot makes this the best horror film ever made.  Throughout the film there is constant references to danger, death and horror. Red is used in EVERY scene. Is the red purposely put in by Kubrick? Of course!.  This is a definitive Kubrick classic and this is the third of his films I have given 10/10. He is a perfectionist in his direction and you can see it in all his films. He loves to perplex his watchers in everyone of his films.  I will be talking about this film for months to come. It has infinite depth.  In conclusion, this is the cornerstone of horror and tension. A masterpiece of terror 10/10\", \"Kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film. Mainly through cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start. It really is this flawless ambiance that makes The Shining the masterpiece that it is, in my eyes. Of course it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. A frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be nice, but it's easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant. Plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).\", \"The Shining starts with Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) driving to an isolated hotel named the 'Overlook' situated high in the Colorado mountains for an interview with it's manager Stuart Ullman (Barry Nelson) about becoming the Winter caretaker. Ullman tells Jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh Winter sets in. Together with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) & young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) Jack moves into the hotel & at first everything seems fine, it's a beautiful hotel, absolutely huge & whatever they need is at their disposal. However the Overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide & Danny has the ability to 'shine' which means he has psychic powers that let him see & hear things 'ordinary' people can't. As the days, weeks & months begin to pass Jack become more & more insane, Danny keeps 'seeing' things & people while Wendy becomes frantic as she doesn't have a clue what's happening to her family, as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped Jack finally loses it...  This English production was co-written, co-produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick & is a fine horror film. It appears that The Shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions & the one I will be commenting on is the shorter European cut that runs just under 2 hours in length. The script by Kubrick & Diane Johnson, is based on the novel by Stephen King which I have not read so I can't compare them, goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film. There are very few character's in The Shining with Jack, Wendy & Danny the only ones that really matter, since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them, become involved with them & what they go through. The pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didn't feel that long & keeps you interested throughout. On the negative side I don't think the reasoning behind Jack going crazy & wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me, the fact that Jack escapes from the freezer without any explanation bugs me & I don't know if I missed something but that ending didn't make any sense to me whatsoever, I'm still trying to work out what that picture is all about! There is very little in the way of violence or gore, a couple of rotten zombie ghosts & someone is killed with an axe but The Shining is a horror film that doesn't need to rely on blood & special effects as it has a gripping story. With a budget of about $19,000,000 The Shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as Kubrick, the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic free-flowing & smooth steadicam shots as the camera effortlessly follows the character's around the maze of corridors, the sets look absolutely real & instead of clich\\u00e9d old haunted house themes like dark corners, basements & cobwebs Kubrick brings things right up-to-date with brightly lit corridors, massive open expansive spaces & a modern decor (well 80's modern, just check that red toilet out!). The acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying & Nicholson seems crazy from the very start. The Shining is an absorbing film that I enjoyed watching although I'm not sure I'd watch it again anytime soon. For those looking for explosions & fancy special effects you will be disappointed, for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story I definitely think The Shining is for you, well worth a watch in my humble opinion.\", \"When i first went to watch The Shining I was expecting a decent film from what I had heard about it and I liked a lot of Stanley Kubrick's other work but when I started to watch it it was so much better than I thought it would be.At times I seriously felt ridiculously uneasy and I couldn't take my eyes of the screen still there's something very disturbing about everything in the film. Now some people don't like Kubrick's version of The Shining since it doesn't entirely follow Stephen King's book but in my opinion both Kubrick's version,the mini-series and the book are all great.Jack Nicholson gives an awesome performance.If you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch The Shining.\", \"... This isn't the first time Stanley blurred the distinction between genres to such great effect, either. In Dr. Strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation, and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments. Slow-burning madness and attempting to kill one's family isn't hilarious of course, but the dialogue is very knowing (\\\"five months of peace is just what I want... \\\") and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit, but is spine-chilling when you factor in the other.  I disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on Jack Torrance in the filmed version. The cues Nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness, which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son. The environment that he is in, however, then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness. In much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there, the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man, and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return. He may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives, but to me the Overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off.  Kubrick's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film, and the unpredictable force of nature that is Jack Nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you. When he explodes, you won't be sure how far he can go. Together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic. If you want a great viewing experience, then this is an example that well and truly shines...\", \"*!!- SPOILERS - !!*  Before I begin this, let me say that I have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the \\\"Authorized Version\\\" of this movie, remade by Stephen King, himself, in 1997.  Both advantages made me appreciate this version of \\\"The Shining,\\\" all the more.  Also, let me say that I've read Mr. King's book, \\\"The Shining\\\" on many occasions over the years, and while I love the book and am a huge fan of his work, Stanley Kubrick's retelling of this story is far more compelling ... and SCARY.  Kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film. In the direction of the movie AND the writing of the screenplay, itself, he acquired the title \\\"Magus\\\" beyond question. Kubrick's genius is like magic. The movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999. Among his other outstanding credits are: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A Clockwork Orange, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many more.  The Torrences (Jack, Wendy his wife and Danny, their son) are living in the Overlook Hotel for the winter; Jack has been hired as the caretaker. It is his job to oversee the upkeep of the hotel during the several months of hard snow, until spring when the Overlook reopens its doors. It seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the Colorado Mountains for a snow-filled summer getaway.  The Hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging. It lent to the atmosphere, by having a dark, yet at the same time \\\"welcoming\\\" atmosphere, itself. The furnishings and furniture was all period (late 70's - early 80's), and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant. It not only lets you enjoy the approach to the Overlook, it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the Hotel is from the rest of the world.  The introduction of Wendy and Danny's characters was a stroke of genius. You get the whole story of their past, Danny's \\\"imaginary friend,\\\" Tony, and the story of Jack's alcoholism all rolled into this nice, neat introductory scene. There was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie; obviously, Kubrick saw that from the beginning.  Closing Day. Again, the scenic drive up the mountains to the Hotel (this time, with family in tow), the interaction between Jack and Danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange.  The initial tour through the Overlook is quite breathtaking, even as the \\\"staff\\\" is moving things out, you get a chance to see the majestic fire places, the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings, dormants and crown moldings in the architecture. \\\"They did a good job! Pink and gold are my favorite colors.\\\" (Wendy Torrence) Even the \\\"staff wing\\\" is well designed and beautifully built.  The maze was a magnificent touch, reminiscent of the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete was Guardian. When Jack Nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center, seeing Wendy and Danny entering, it's a magickal moment; one that tells you right away, there are heavy energies in that house; there's something seriously wrong, already starting. \\\"I wouldn't want to go in there unless I had at least an hour to find my way out.\\\" (The Hotel Manager)  Scatman Cruthers, as Dick Halloran, was genuine and open in his performance. His smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful. You could actually believe you were there in the hotel, taking the tour of the kitchen with Wendy and \\\"Doc.\\\" His explanation of \\\"the shining\\\" to Danny was very well delivered, as was his conversation with the child about Tony and the Hotel. It was believable and sincere.  The cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself, with the mountains looming behind, the cold air swirling about, mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel, adds so MUCH to the atmosphere of the movie. It also marks the \\\"half-way-to-hell\\\" point, so to speak; the turning point in the movie.  Shelley Duvall's portrayal of Wendy Torrence was masterful. (So WHAT if she also played Olive Oyl?! It just shows her marvelous diversity!) Honestly, before I saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, I said,\\\" What? Olive Oyl? *lol* (Popeye was also released in 1980.) But I took that back as soon as the movie started. She's brilliant. In this Fiend's opinion, this is her best performance, to date! (Although I did love her in Steve Martin's \\\"Roxanne,\\\" 1987.)  Once Kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you, the viewer, need to be in possession: the Torrence's past; Danny's broken arm; Tony; the history of the Hotel itself; the fact that Danny is not \\\"mental,\\\" but rather clairvoyant instead, and the general layout of the Hotel; all of which you get in the opening 3 sequences; the movie never stops scaring you.  The two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady (the girls having appeared several times to Danny, first by way of Tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel) were icons with which Danny could identify, and of which he was afraid, at the same time. They were haunting (and haunted), themselves and showed Danny how and where they were killed, in a rather graphic and material way.  Kubrick's Tony was written as an attendant spirit, like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father. He was...\\\"the little boy who lives in my mouth.\\\" He would manifest in the end of Danny's finger and physically spoke through Danny in order to speak TO Danny. NOT like in the book, I realize, where Tony was intended by Stephen King to be the projection of Danny as an older boy, trying to save his father. Kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when Tony \\\"took ... Danny ... over.\\\" The idea of Danny's older self projecting back to his younger self isn't...scary.  The \\\"Woman in the Shower\\\" scene, done by Lia Beldan (about whom I can find no other credits for having done anything before, or since) as the younger woman and Billie Gibson (who ALSO appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since), was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting. It was dramatic, and frightening. Abhorrent and scary. When Nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands; the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and REAL.  Jack quickly embarks on his trek from the \\\"jonesing\\\" alcoholic to a certifiable insane person. The degradation of his character's mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by Kubrick. Jack's instant friendship with Lloyd the Bartender (as only alcoholics, would-be mental patients and drug addicts do) portrays his pressing NEED of the atmosphere to which Lloyd avails him; namely, alcohol ...\\\"hair of the dog that bit me.\\\" (Jack Torrence) In Jack's case, it's bourbon on the rocks, at no charge to Jack. \\\"Orders from the house.\\\" (Lloyd the Bartender) Nice play on words.  When Wendy find's Jack's \\\"screenplay\\\" is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles...when he asks from the shadows, \\\"How do you like it?\\\" and Wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand...is so poignant. It's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is...how messed up Jack is. It's very scary, dramatic and delivers a strong presence. That coupled with Danny's visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood, imposed over the scene between Jack and Wendy, and with the confrontational ending to this scene, make this possibly THE strongest scene of the movie.  The \\\"REDRUM\\\" scene. Wow. What do I say? What mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young, troubled son standing over them with a huge knife, talking in that freaky little voice, exclaiming \\\"REDRUM\\\" over and over? Even if it HAD no meaning, it would still be as scary as the 7th level of HELL. It was something everyone could (and has) remember(ed). Speaking of memorable scenes...  Nicholson's final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history. His ad-libbed line, \\\"Heeeeere's Johnny!\\\" was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. It also goes down in horror movie history.  The ending..? Kubrick's ending was perfection. I felt it ended beautifully. No smarm, no platitudinous whining, no tearfully idiotic ending for THIS movie. Just epitomized perfection. That's all I'll say on the subject of the ending.  Who cares what was taken out?! Look what Kubrick put IN. Rent it, watch it, BUY IT. It's a classic in the horror genre, and for good reason. IT RAWKS!!  *Me being Me* ... Take this movie, and sitck it in your Stephen King collection, and take the 1997 \\\"Authorized\\\" version done by King and stick it down in the kiddie section. That's where it belongs. .: This movie rates a 9.98 from the Fiend :.\", \"Sometimes it takes a film-making master like Kubrick to bring that extra little something, that unique, untractable and elusive ingredient that transforms a great movie or a great script into a masterpiece, one for the ages.  It's not just that Stephen King's story has enough meat and potatoes making it difficult for even the most workmanlike of directors to miss. Heck, even King himself didn't fare so bad. It's how Kubrick perceives King's universe, how he transforms the page into screen time, that renders THE SHINING both a visual feast and a compacted masterclass in directing.  Kubrick's miss-en-scene is, as usually, terrific. The movie progresses with a brisk, sharp, lively pace, even though it's neither fast nor heavily edited and it clocks at no less than 160 minutes. The camera prowls through the lavish corridors of the Overlook Hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration, linear tracking shots exposing the impeccably decorated interiors in all their grandeur. There's a symmetry and geometrical approach in how Kubrick perceives space that reminds me very much of how Japanese directors worked in the sixties. As if what is depicted is inconsequential to how all the different elements are balanced inside the frame.  Certain images definitely stand out. The first shot of Jack's typewriter, accompanied off screen from the thumps of a ball, like drums of doom coming from some other floor or produced by the typewriter itself as though it is an instrument of doom all by itself, later on proving to be nothing short of just that. A red river flowing through the hotel's elevators in slow motion. Jack hitting the door with the axe, the camera moving along with him, tracking the action as it happens instead of remaining static, as though it's the camera piercing through the door and not the axe. The ultra fast zoom in the kid's face thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his POV. And of course, the bathroom scene.  Much has been said of Jack Nicholson's obtrusive overacting. His mad is not entirely successful, because, well, he's Jack Nicholson. The guy looks half-mad anyway. Playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself. Shelley Duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices Kubrick ever had. Coming from a streak of fantastic performances for Robert Altman in the seventies (3 WOMEN, THIEVES LIKE US, NASHVILLE), she brings to her character the right amounts of fragility and emotional distress. A terrific and very underrated actress.\", \"Even though The Shining is over a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone to not get freaked out by Jack Nicholson's descent into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture. The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense \\\"writing\\\"... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script.\", \"The Shining, you know what's weird about this movie? This is the movie that everyone, for people who claim to not like horror films, will always say that The Shining is a terrific film. This is Stanley Kubrick's classic vision of Stephen King's horror tale of madness and blood. This is just an incredible film and wither you have seen it or not, you have heard of it, know a few lines from it, and know some of the classic images. Who could forget Jack's \\\"Here's Johnny!\\\"? Who could forget \\\"All Work and No Play Make Jack a Dull Boy\\\"? Who could forget that chilling ending? This is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is Kubrick's best work. I know there is a lot of argument in that department, a lot of people say it's 2001: A Space Odyssey or Clockwork Orange or even Dr. Strangelove, but if those film pioneered film making, then The Shining perfected it. This is the tale of isolation, madness, terrifying images, and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin.   Jack Torrance, Jack's son Danny, and Jack's wife, Wendy arrive at the Overlook Hotel on closing day. The elderly African-American chef, Dick Hallorann, surprises Danny by speaking to him telepathically and offering him some ice cream. He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared the gift; they called the communication \\\"shining.\\\" Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237. Dick tells Danny that the hotel has a certain \\\"shine\\\" to it and many memories, not all of them good, and advises him to stay out of room 237 under all circumstances. Danny's curiosity about Room 237 finally gets the better of him when he sees the room has been opened. Danny shows up injured and visibly traumatized after Jack tells Wendy that he loves his family. Seeing this, Wendy thinks Jack has been abusing Danny. Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd. Danny starts calling out the word \\\"redrum\\\" frantically, and scribbling it on walls. He goes into a trance, and withdraws; he now says that he is Tony, his own \\\"imaginary friend.\\\" Jack sabotages the hotel radio, cutting off communication from the outside world, but Hallorann has received Danny's telepathic cry for help and is on his way. Wendy discovers that Jack has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating \\\"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\\\" formatted in various ways. Horrified, Jack threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat, locking him in a storage locker in the kitchen. Jack converses with Grady through the door of the locker, which then unlocks releasing him. Danny has written \\\"REDRUM\\\" in lipstick on the door of Wendy's bedroom. When she looks in the mirror, she sees that it is \\\"Murder\\\" spelled backwards. Jack picks up an axe and begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters. \\\"Here's Johnny!\\\", and Jack's legendary image is born.  The Shining is one of those films that you seriously have to make time to see, this is an incredible film and still gives me nightmares. Jack Nicholson's performance is timeless and unforgettable. But one I also feel is extremely overlooked is Shelley Duvall, her scene of finding Jack's rant All Work\\u0085 is incredible, that's a look of horror and you can see that fear in her face after realizing her husband is mad. Also another incredible scene is when Jack sees a ghost woman in the bathtub, it's honestly one of the most terrifying scenes in horror cinema. The reason this film is so well known is because it's a film of perfection, it's been on The Simpsons, it's been shown in other films and it's a film that will forever stay with you when you see it, trust me.  10/10\", \"Okay, okay, maybe not THE greatest. I mean, The Exorcist and Psycho and a few others are hard to pass up, but The Shining is way up there. It is, however, by far the best Stephen King story that has been made into a movie. It's better than The Stand, better than Pet Sematary (if not quite as scary), better than Cujo, better than The Green Mile, better the Dolores Claiborne, better than Stand By Me (just barely, though), and yes, it's better than The Shawshank Redemption (shut up, it's better), I don't care WHAT the IMDb Top 250 says.   I read that, a couple of decades ago, Stanley Kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie, and from the other room, his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration. Finally, she didn't hear any noise for almost two hours, and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something (I tell this with all due respect, of course), she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand, and the book was The Shining. And thank God, too, because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever.  Stephen King can be thanked for the complexity of the story, about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing. Jack Nicholson can be thanked for his dead-on performance as Jack Torrance (how many movies has Jack been in where he plays a character named Jack?), as well as his flawless delivery of several now-famous lines (`Heeeeeere's Johnny!!'). Shelley Duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to Jack's desires to kill her. Stanley Kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch, and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls.  One of the most significant aspects of this movie, necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect, is the isolation, and it's presents flawlessly. The film starts off with a lengthy scene following Jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter. This is soon followed by the same thing following Jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel. This time the scene is intermixed with shots of Jack, Wendy, and Danny talking in the car, in which Kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of TV, as Wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of Danny, who says that it's okay because he's already seen it on TV (`See? It's okay, he saw it on the television.').  The hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place, and it's bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge, echoing rooms and the long hallways. These rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel, but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie, and Kubrick's traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three-dimensional feel. Early in the film, there is a famous tracking shot that follows Danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his Big Wheel (is that what those are called?), and his relative speed (as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs) gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner. And being a Stephen King story, you EXPECT something to jump out at you. I think that the best scene in the halls (as well as one of the scariest in the film) is when Danny is playing on the floor, and a ball rolls slowly up to him. He looks up and sees the long empty hallway, and because the ball is something of a child's toy, you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him. Anyway, you get the point. The Shining is a damn scary movie.  Besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesn't suck, The Shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed. HAD Jack always been there, like Mr. Grady told him in the men's room? Was he really at that ball in 1921, or is that just someone who looks exactly like him? If he has always been the caretaker, as Mr. Grady also said, does that mean that it was HIM that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters, and not Mr. Grady, after all? It's one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied, that's just mediocre filmmaking. For example, The Amityville Horror, which obviously copied much of The Shining as far as its subject matter, did this. But it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think (as mostly all of Kubrick's movies are). One more thing that we can all thank Stanley Kubrick for, and we SHOULD thank him for, is for not throwing this book against the wall. That one toss would have been cinematic tragedy.\", \"I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.  The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?  One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.  The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10\", \"Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance's mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.  And it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.  Rating: 9/10\", \"This has got to be the most stupid film I have ever seen (spoilers ahead)! First of all, the plot is stupid. The little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it. We find that the kid has a gift, the \\\"Shining\\\". This gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool. Then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy. He goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because... well, he feels like it. Why else would he do it? All of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub. The man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse, which is utterly disgusting. Somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe. Then the kid and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father, who dies within minutes of hypothermia. Most movies aren't a complete waste of time, but this falls right into that category. The music is trashy, the characters are corny (except Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit, the ending is very predictable, the storyline is slow, tedious, and boring. This movie is extremely overrated. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS. I'm surprised it's gotten such a high rating on IMDb.\", \"After just finishing the book the same day I watched the movie, I knew what was supposed to happen. I had high expectations of the movie, because of the rating. The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie. I have a couple main points for not liking this movie.  ********** SPOILERS **********  1. The casting. Jack Nicholson barely fits into Jack Torrence's character. Also, I would have NEVER picked Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I pictured Wendy much differently. I can see why they picked Jack Nicholson though, the grin, the pointy eyebrows, but he's not supposed to really look 'evil'. He's supposed to look normal, and he turns evil. Also, they make one of the worst movie couples. Danny was alright, he needed more life though. He acted way to droney.  2. The screenplay. They cut out so many things that were in the book, and added things. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted, changed, or handled wrongly. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to seeing (the hedge animals, the roque mallet, the elevator) were not in the movie, and it was 2 and half hours!! I was extremely irritated.  3. The Ending. The ending was changed completly, Halorann died, Jack froze to death, Wendy never got hurt...The Overlook didn't blow up. The Ending was so cool in the book, and the movie messed it up so horribly, I was apalled. Hallorann was never supposed to die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least have Jack use a roque mallet. You never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie.  There are other things that I didn't like about the movie, but there are things that were all right. The camera angels were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (didn't happen in the book) was cool, but maybe I was too irritated that the movie didn't go with the book, to try to be scared at all. I reccomend reading the book, before you see this movie. I applaud Stephen King for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis Stanley Kubrik any more. I would never have done that, I would have taken all the rights I could get to yell at him all day. I can't wait to see the 6 hour version, at least it has the hedge animals.  Rating: 2/10\", \"I am going to keep this short.This \\\"adaption\\\" of the wonderful King book is a bad joke and nothing more.Of course there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans in this site and,as a result,this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top-250.  Jack Nicholson is laughable as Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall.The story,that has nothing to do with the book,is an incoherent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes.  My advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story:stick to the TV series ....  Oh ,and the people who are saying that Kubrick had every right to destroy the King story cause King is...not a good writer should stick to reviewing \\\"masterpieces\\\" like \\\"eyes wide shut\\\".\", \"Ok, honestly I dont see why everybody thinks this is so great. Its really not. There were two good things that came out of this movie 1. Jack's performance, he was very good I can tip my hat for him. 2. Danny's performance, he was good. No other then that it got pretty stupid. And, what was Stanley Kubrick thinking drafting Shelly as the Wendy? She was so bad. She looked the same every time she got scared. The problem with this movie was the ending. I would have had more respect for it if Kubrick would have ended it differently. And, the over all movie was just stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. So dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off. 3/10.\", \"Ladies and Gentlemen,please don't get fooled by \\\"A Stanley Kubrick\\\" film tag.This is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made.Horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film.In Shining,there is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naive,foolish attempt made to create chilling horror.Everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality.All that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley. The hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too.A word about the actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lost,lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do.There is not much to be said of a bald,colored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor.No need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy.It cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor Kubrick is not alive to make any changes.\", \"Not the best of the films to be watched nowadays. I read a lot of reviews about Shining and was expecting it to be very good. But this movie disappointed me. The sound and environment was good, but there was no story here. Not was there a single moment of fright. I expected it to a horror thriller movie, but there was no horror no thriller. The only scene where I got scared was during the chapter change scene showing \\\"Wednesday\\\". There are lots of fragments i the movie. Most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything. The story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown. Might be a good movie to watch in the 80's, but not for the 21st century.\", \"These writings write about the end of the plot so don't read it if you haven't seen this rubbish.  I found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror. If I owned a video store I'd put it in the BORING section. This film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks.  This film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary. Well I drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me it's not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving. Even the little kid does it too. Round and round he goes and he never stops. What's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour? I think NOTHING and if you watch it you will not think so too.  The family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens. Then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. That's all that happens and as you can see it's rubbish.\", \"Many King fans hate this because it departed from the book, but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump. That notwithstanding, the movie does fail completely, but it fails entirely on film terms. I'd like to smack the people who tell me it's the scariest movie ever made. I always follow up with the question \\\"Really... exactly what scene scared you?\\\" Every fan I've asked, goes silent. Occasionally someone, at a loss for a decent scare (There are none...), names the \\\"Grape-juice-shooting-out-of-elevators\\\" shtick. If you're afraid of that, I don't know what to tell you, except maybe that you're easily scared. I just rolled my eyes watching these z-grade horror ideas play out in this schlocky, incoherent movie.  One place it diverts from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get Mr Halloran up to the Overlook only to kill him; with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that it takes Halloran FOREVER to walk down. Really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film.   Oh, and nice choice for Mr. Halloran's artwork Stanley! Black light afro-nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie. Has there ever been a more \\\"off,\\\" out-of-place shot in any movie ever made?  I consider it a miracle that I was eventually able to bypass this turd, and agree that Kubricks 2001 is a truly important film, given the immense 'bad will' generated by both this stupid, stupid movie, and the cult of fawning but inarticulate Kubrick fan-boys, who couldn't describe an idea at work in it with every film resource in the Library of Congress in front of them.   Toss in the grotesque overacting of Jack Nicholson, the introduction of dumb one-liners at tense moments, and the Razzie nominated performance of Shelly Duvall and you have a very crappy movie.\", \"I hate this movie! It was NOTHING like the book, and just thinking about it makes me mad. If you watch the movie before reading the book, then yeah, it's a good movie. But King's book was AMAZING and this movie was nothing like it. I mean, the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different. The ending for example! So in the book it is extremely intense and Danny and Wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes. but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze... yeah, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it. Another part that made me angry was that jack just kills Mr. Halloran! what the heck, he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he wasn't important. Overall, it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off.\", \"I caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel, and was reminded of how terrible I thought it was in 1980 when first released. Many reviewers out there aren't old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. The enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed \\\"master\\\" director put this multi-layered supernatural story on the screen. \\\"Salem's Lot\\\" had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a TV mini-series, directed by Tobe Hooper (he of \\\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\\" fame) and was badly handled, turning the major villain of the book into a \\\"Chiller Theatre\\\" vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise. Fans hoped that a director of Kubrick's stature would succeed where Hooper had failed. It didn't happen.  Sure, this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments, it's all downhill. Jack Nicholson cannot be anything but Jack Nicholson. He's always crazy and didn't bring anything to his role here. I don't care that many reviewers here think he's all that in this clinker, the \\\"Here's Johnny!\\\" bit notwithstanding...he's just awful in this movie. So is everyone else, for that matter. Scatman Crothers' character, Dick Halloran, was essential to the plot of the book, yet Kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest \\\"shock\\\" sequences ever put on film. I remember the audience in the theater I saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick, those that stayed that is...many left. King's books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters, and often metaphysically. Kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately don't really care what happens to whom.  This movie still stinks and why so many think it's a horror masterpiece is beyond me.\", \"Kubrick meets King. It sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980, I remember. Then the movie came out, and the Kubrick cultists have been bickering with the King cultists ever since.  The King cultists say Stanley Kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it. The Kubrick cultists don't give a damn about King's story. They talk about Steadicams, tracking shots, camera angles.This is a film, they insist: It should be considered on its own. As it happens, both camps are correct. Unfortunately.  If one views it purely as an adaptation of King's novel, \\\"The Shining\\\" is indeed a failure, a wasted opportunity, a series of botched narrative gambits.   I used to blame that on Kubrick's screenwriter. The writer Diane Johnson (author of Le Marriage, L'Affaire, Le Divorce, etc.) has a reputation as an novelist of social manners. Maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics. But the little blue-collar town of Sidewinder, Colorado doesn't exist on any map in her Francophile universe.   Kubrick the Anglophile probably found her congenial, however. He, of course, is the real auteur. And considered on its own merits, his screenplay for \\\"The Shining\\\" -- with its mishmash of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism, and implied reincarnation -- just doesn't stand up to logical analysis.  I'm willing to consider Kubrick's \\\"Shining\\\" on its own terms. I'm even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horror-genre movie. But it doesn't succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation, alienation, and madness either. Parsed either way, the film pretty much falls apart.  Are the horrors of the Overlook Hotel real? Or do they exist only in the mind -- first as prescient nightmares suffered by little Danny Torrance, then as the hallucinations of his father? One notes how whenever Jack Torrance is seen talking to a \\\"ghost\\\" he is in fact looking into a mirror. One notes how the hotel's frozen topiary-hedge maze appears to symbolize Jack's stunted, convoluted psyche. Very deep stuff.  But if indeed the Overlook's \\\"ghosts\\\" are purely manifestations of Jack Torrance's growing insanity, then who exactly lets the trapped Jack out of the hotel kitchen's dead-bolted walk- in closet, so that he can go on his climactic ax-wielding rampage?  And can ANYONE explain, with a straight face, that black-and-white photograph (helpfully labelled \\\"1921\\\") of Nicholson as a tuxedoed party-goer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotel-ballroom wall during the film's closing seconds? Are we to seriously conclude that Jack Torrance's Bad Craziness stems from a some sort of \\\"past life\\\" experience? (And if you swallow that, since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas their past selves?)  Maybe Kubrick didn't care about his storyline. Maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror. Whatever the case, the film tries to hedge its narrative bets -- to have it both ways, rational and supernatural. As a result, the story is a mess. This movie hasn't improved with age, and it certainly doesn't improve with repeated viewings.  I don't deny that a few moments of fear, claustrophobia, and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long, long film. But those gushing Elevators o' Blood, seen repeatedly in little Danny's visions, are absurd and laughable. And Jack Torrance's infamous tag lines (\\\"Wendy, I'm home!\\\" and \\\"Heeeeeere's JOHNNY!\\\") merely puncture the movie's dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy. (I know: I sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief: \\\"Whew! Glad we don't have to take this stuff seriously!\\\") Finally, Kubrick is completely at sea -- or else utterly cynical -- during those scenes in which Wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son. A foyer full of mummified guests, all sitting there dead in their party hats? Yikes, now I really am afraid.  Given Jack Nicholson's brilliance over the years, one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeball-rolling, eyebrow-wiggling, scenery-chomping performance that the director wanted. The performance of Shelley Duvall, as a sort of female version of Don Knotts in \\\"The Ghost and Mr. Chicken,\\\" is best passed over in silence.  This movie simply doesn't succeed -- not as an adaptation, not on its own terms.

Following the quest of Ichabod Crane \\u0096 played by Johnny Depp, delivering this dreary film's only shining point \\u0096 to the heart of the mystery surrounding a town's seemingly random and gruesome murders by a fabled headless horseman, the story plays out as if it were purposely trying to be repugnantly predictable. Contrived as a children's bedtime story, humdrum character introduction is laced with intended-upon exciting non-engaging chase scenes which, with undeveloped characters fleeing for their lives, produce about as much fright and thrill as The Nightmare Before Christmas.  Toss in an endless bundle of old trees for ambience and a wide-eyed, big-busted blonde love interest (Christina Reechi) and Burton has himself a movie that takes the age-old legend of Sleepy Hollow and succeeded in making it like a Disney movie without the charm or captivation. Dialog was choppy and ridiculous, severed heads were aplenty, and there were enough plot-revealing monologues to embarrass the likes of James Bond. Even with the backing of Emmanuel Lubezki, the most sought-after cinematographer in Hollywood today, the wonderful acting of Depp and Burton's astounding name-recognition, Sleepy Hollow is nothing to lose your head over.\", \"I have in the past loved Tim Burton. I loved Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and even Mars Attacks. But I hate this movie. The costume drama scenes in the beginning were the sort of poorly done, stodgy things that used to plague historical drama 25 years ago. Then there were all the head-cutting scenes, which just left me cold, and that's the sort of thing that ought to mean something, I would think. Yes, there were some nice bare trees and foggy evenings and the horseman jumping out of the tree was a nice special effect, but on the whole the movie was just boring and pointless.\", \"this film had a lot of potential - it's a great story and has the potential to be very creepy. but of course tim burton doesn't really do creepy films, he does wacky cartoonish films. and i usually like tim burton's stuff. but i thought this film was really weak. the best thing about the film (and it is actually worth seeing just for this) was the art direction - the film has an amazing intangible quality to it. the script was not good. it was boring in parts and confusing in other parts, and there was no building of characters. i never really cared that people were having their heads lopped off by a headless being. i thought johnny depp had a good thing going with his approach to the character, but given that the script was weak he couldn't go too far with it - and i was very irritated by the attempts at a slight accent on his and christina ricci's parts.  anyway, it is sadly not a great film and not worth seeing unless you are interested in the art direction.\", \"Several things become apparent after the first few minutes of this film. First, the scenery and special effects are incredible -- the best, and if everything else worked as well, its austere presence might have made it a great film.  But as soon as the actors open their mouths, you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your den watching a movie. The story itself is full of clech\\u00e9 and melodrama, and the dialogue is some of the worst I've ever seen. And as if that weren't bad enough, they made a fool out of the protagonist, and in my experience, you don't want to do that unless the film is a comedy.  Bottom line: I had a hard time getting into it, and I wouldn't recommend it.\", \"surely this film was hacked up by the studio? perhaps not but i feel there were serious flaws in the storytelling that if not attributed to the editing process could only be caused by grievously bad, criminal indeed, writing and directing.  i understand the effect burton wished to achieve with the stylised acting similar to the gothic fairytale atmosphere of edward scissorhands, but here unfortunately it falls flat and achieves no mythical depth of tropes but only the offensive tripe of affectation. ie bad acting and shallow characterisation even for a fairytale.  finally not that scary, indeed only mildly amusing in its attempts. the use of dialogue as a vehicle for plot background was clumsy and unnecessary. the mystery of who is the headless horseman would suffice, no need for the myth about a german mercenary, although christopher walken did cut a dashing figure but not that menacing - seeing the horsemans head makes him seem far friendlier that a decapitated inhuman nine foot tall spirit as in the original legend.  no real rhythm or universal tone was ever established and not a classic in burtons oevure. stilted and clipped as my parting shot...\", \"The original review I had planned for this movie was perhaps a little over-harsh, so I'll preface with the good: Sleepy Hollow is a perfectly acceptable beer-and-pizza or sleepover movie, the kind you watch with a good group of people when the mood is light and no-one's really focusing on the movie. The visual elements are beautiful, and it is kinda fun, in parts. But horror, my friends, it is not. I made the mistake of watching it expecting something to shiver at with all the lights off. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and I'll offer you a list of alternate recommendations. (That's a serious offer, by the way. True horror fans deserve better.) Now my complaints, complete with SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Why bother even making a movie \\\"based\\\" on a classic story if you're not even going to attempt to stay true to the sense, feel, tone, or theme of the original? Listen carefully between the lines of ill-written dialogue and you'll hear the slow churn of Washington Irving rolling over in his grave. I will even accept the Big-City Detective bit, but... Ricci drawing warding-hexes around the bed? Come, now. Not only is there nothing even vaguely like this in \\\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\\", but it's historical BUNK. I don't care what neo-pagan axe you have to grind, but in the 18th century, \\\"witchcraft\\\" meant selling your soul to the Devil in exchange for diabolical powers; this whole fluffy white-witch goddess-worship \\\"an'-it-harm-none\\\" approach to witchcraft dates back, historically, about as far as the British Invasion. (Parties interested in real old-school pagan practices are referred to James Frazer's \\\"The Golden Bough\\\", if you don't believe me.) This creates such a discordant element thrown into the context of the film that the very framework of the Sleepy Hollow legend is shattered. So we wind up with a totally different story altogether. If that was Burton's idea, I wish he'd warned us in advance. Also, I wish he'd come up with a better story than the rather pedestrian one witnessed here. And he might as well have dropped the Irving pretensions altogether. And, at any rate, the movie isn't scary. Not once. Not at all. The warped tree came close, but was more than counterbalanced by the laughable effect of the Hessian's farce-comedy bellowing.

I am a big nut for Sci-Fi action flicks though anyway.  Without giving any of the story away, it is worth seeing if you like Sci-Fi without requiring much thought. The story is basic, and the plot is very good. Worth your time to see!  Maybe they will make a sequel? :)  8 out of 10\", \"I really liked this movie. Kurt manages to act without speaking, letting moments speak for themselves. He doesn't have to verbalize or rationalize his actions, he simply decides and takes action. He is supported by a good cast of actors and settings, and is able to show us a more humane side of soldiers without getting to corny.\", \"Of course, by any normal standard of film criticism, Soldier is a very poor film indeed. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldiers at a dangly hoop ruck that looks a bit like a Gladiators contest without the crash mats.  Abandoned on a junk planet, he's befriended by a community of naff space hippies that teach him about gardening, family life and, um, breasts. Kurt doesn't talk much. Finally the really super soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they're running away. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. A planet gets totalled. The end.  Unless the Academy start a new category for \\\"Best Explosion\\\", Soldier is not going to win any awards. However, as ludicrous as it is, it remains an enjoyable experience. The military hardware is the coolest since Aliens (the APC's especially) and, at 90 minutes long, it doesn't outstay its welcome. Please note that the below mark is only a guide. Knock five points off if you intend to take it seriously and discount one more if you don't like miniguns.  7 out of 10\", \"I have to say I quite enjoyed Soldier. Russell was very good as this trained psychopath rediscovering his humanity. Very watchable and nowhere near as bad as I'd been led to believe. Yes it has problems but provides its share of entertainment.\", \"Interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything constructive to. However, i'll try. This was a very good action film with some great set pieces. You'll note I specified the genre. I didn't snipe about the lack of characterisation, and I didn't berate the acting. Enjoy if for what it is people, a well above average action film. I could go on but I've made my comment.\", \"SOLDIER is not as bad as many have made it out to be. I found the film to have some of the sacarstic, cynical humour like that in Paul Verhoven's Starship Troopers. The lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic-book atmosphere.  One particular trivia-bit stands out for me - Todd has the names of several space-war campaigns tattoo'd onto his chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE. For the oblivious ones out there, Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in Roy Batty's elegiac last lines in Blade Runner. To imagine that Todd could have fought alongside android troops like Roy is mind boggling to say the least. Maybe script writer David Peoples was nostalgic?  I'll give this one 3 out of 5.\", \"this movie is ok if you like mindless action ,corny acting, and a very small plot !The special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director of\\\"Event Horizon\\\". The costumes are like something from a mad max movie .None of the soldiers talk ,so others tell them what to do.It eventually end up as a big shoot'em up movie with explosions all the place. I personally liked Russell better in \\\"tango and cash\\\"\\\"escape from la/new york\\\" and \\\"executive decision\\\". It must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a no brainer action science fiction movie!!\", \"I've watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it wasn't as successful (commercially or artistically) as it should have been, and discovered considerable artistic merit--which may ultimately have been its commercial undoing.  First of all, this movie attempts \\\"serious\\\" science-fiction, social commentary, more than action-adventure. There is action in it, but that's not really what it's about. If you focus on that, you'll end up with (as others have noted) a bad \\\"Aliens\\\" clone. But, again, that's not what it's about.  The movie is really about Todd's (Kurt Russell) transformation from human to near-machine and back to human (mostly *back*). But because it's not trying to give you a typically glib Hollywood style answer, Kurt Russell must make this transformation without speaking, and largely without broad expressions. And he really does a wonderful job--it can take two viewings to appreciate it.  The surrounding \\\"social logic\\\" is flawed and it's never adequately explained whether Todd's ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound human-ness or what, but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for Russell's (easy to underestimate) talent.\", \"What a perfect example of \\\"Less Is More...\\\" Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) only has 72 lines, and something like 104 words. What a challenge! Like a black and white photo, when your mind's eye has to fill in the blanks, the facial expressions, the physical drama, the emotive gesture, all combines to make a stronger impact. This is one of those top 5 movies I can't live without, right up there with the classics like Road Warrior. If you liked this, check out \\\"Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior\\\" and \\\"Braveheart\\\" both starring Mel Gibson. Also \\\"Gladiator\\\" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who was in Soldier also. The \\\"Thirteenth Warrior\\\" starring Antonio Banderas and \\\"Blade Runner\\\" starring Harrison Ford.\", \"I fell in love with this silent action drama. Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have played this so well. Raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting, Todd (Kurt Russell) is dumped on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically engineered soldiers.  The stage is set and another classic icon of action movies was born - SOLDIER. Not Rambo, not Schwarzenegger, not Bruce Willis, not Mel Gibson, not Jason Statham - Kurt Russell owns this role and made it entirely his - original, daring, and all too human.

I loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 or so stars. This movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns there is more to life than soldiering, and people who learn that there is a time for fighting, a need to defend. I cried, laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story. Good writing job for an action flick, and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid. The ending wasn't twisty, but it was still excellent. If you like escape from New York, or rooting for the underdog, this movie is for you. Not an undue amount of gore or violence, it was not difficult to watch in that respect. Something for everyone.\", \"Stoic and laconic soldier Sergeant Todd (a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable Kurt Russell) gets dumped on a desolate remote planet after he's deemed obsolete by ruthless and arrogant Colonel Mekum (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Jason Isaacs), who has Todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically engineered combatants. Todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self-reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, working from a smart and provocative script by David Webb Peoples, depicts a chilling vision of a bleak, cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough, gritty tone throughout. Moreover, Anderson handles moving moments of humanity well (Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant) and stages the stirring action scenes with rip-roaring gusto. Russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of Todd; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions. Bang-up supporting turns by Jason Scott Lee as brutish rival soldier Caine 607, Connie Nielson as the compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as the kindly Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as mute little boy Nathan, Gary Busey as crusty seasoned veteran Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as the jolly Johnny Pig, and Brenda Wehle as the sensible Mayor Hawkins. Better still, this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might. David Tattersall's polished cinematography, Joel McNeely's rousing full-bore orchestral score, and the first-rate rate special effects all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction/action hybrid outing.\", \"Kurt Russell is so believable and the action so non-stop that it takes thinking about it afterward to realize that there were honest-to-goodness important themes [overcoming fear of The Stranger, learning to rise above early conditioning, the strength that love and friendship can bring, etc.] in the storyline. This is so very rare for a 'guy's action flick' that even I [who thinks most A/A is violent pap] liked the film and have recommended it to every guy I know.....it's a shame this one was overlooked because by rights it should have been one of the biggest action-adventure box office hits -- it has something for everyone without straining credulity or losing the nearly non-stop action moments. I'm afraid the answer to it not becoming a hit lies in the fact that adults did not go to see it. Anyone under 20 probably has not only seen more violent action in their video games but probably would either not catch the multi-layered, multi-themed beauty or not care about it. This film could convert anyone who avoids A/A as mindless violence. If a guy takes his lady [or rents it or sees it in a cable listing] to see this film he'll be much more likely to get her to go with him to other action flicks.\", \"Nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video sci-fi movie that's been vilified at the US box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of Kurt Russell's career.  I have my reasons.  Firstly when you read negative reviews of this film, they usually start with the wooden nature of Russell's interpretation of Todd, the eponymous Soldier. I'm going to start here too, with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting I've seen Russell pull off. Todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense PTSD - this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now.  The portrayal is spot on. Todd is withdrawn, uncommunicative and a loner. He suffers from irrational anxiety - keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger. His hyper-focus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within - there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed, not cleaning up the cut or the blood. Many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand, but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote - not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables he's preparing and the food that will be eaten later.  Todd's dialog is spartan to say the least - the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence. Fear and Discipline we are told. Always. Fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by, keeping him ready to react on a knife edge. Discipline to hold him in check through his fear, to overcome it and perform tactically. The inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings. Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from Nielsen's Sandra - but I believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who's only experience of an embrace is in combat - the trembling represents him suppressing his fight / flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled, his movement and vision restricted - Fear and Discipline indeed.  Then there is the subtext of his abandonment (Twice in fact) - so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when they've served their terms. 40% of the unemployed are ex-military in OUR world, in HIS it can only be worse. Russell quickly picks up the mantle of Mace's responsibility to his wife and child - desperately in need of a mission, even one with such a high likelihood of his death.  Then there is the military subtext too - the conflict between Busey's Church and the hotshot from HQ, Mekum. Mekum's new men are faster, stronger, more accurate and aggressive. Any one of them could pound Todd into the ground - but it's not about the tools you have it's how you use them. An incentivized Todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit - sent in without support, cover or reconnaissance. It is a reminder that military power cannot make up for a failure in leadership.  There are many other subtle themes. When a film is shot and scripted so minimally, it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root. Watch Soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches YOU.\", \"This is a great movie. It has a captivating story, an awesome main character, very good acting and killer action. This takes place mostly in the year 2036 but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story.  The story is very well done and there are no holes. Kurt Russell is a solider named Todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all of the other soldiers have never had normal lives. Eventually the military introduces newer, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. Jason Scott Lee being one of them. As a result they don't have any need for the old soldiers like Todd. They test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers, in the battle Russell is injured and assumed to be dead. The military dumps his body as well as a fewer others assuming they are all dead but what they don't realize is that Russell is alive.  Todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him on. For a while he lives there but can't adjust to normal life. He rarely says a word and he is at times very aggressive towards the other people. When they feel he is a danger to them they send him off to the desert.  Just as Russell's leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers. What the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like Todd and the other old soldiers. So while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd easily outsmarts them. The military starts realizing this and Todd kills all of their men but one. That one is Jason Scott Lee and in the end you see a classic fight scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell obviously comes out on top.  This is one of the best action films I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. This has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines. The writer also didn't forget that Russell had never seen a woman before as he calls even women \\\"sir\\\". There are no holes in this film, every minute has a purpose and it's very entertaining.  An awesome one man army action film for fans of Rambo, Commando and Missing In Action. This is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and action/sci-fi fans.\", \"Soldier may not have academy acting or Lucas special effects but it definitely does it for me. I won't tell you what its about, I'm sure you already read the summary. This is a great doomed futureistic action/science fiction movie. Kurt Russell doesn't say much, he usually has an eerie or drone look on his face but it fits the character. There are great action and fight scenes; some of the scenes are unrealistic, but thats Hollywood make believe land that we should have to escape our normal lives. I have not seen Soldier 2 but this one it one of my favorites. I'm lucky enough to have a wife that digs on guy movies; we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes tough guy/sci-fi movies.\", \"In the movie several references are made in subtly to Blade runner, but one of the most obvious is the fact the Cain 607 and his unit are all genetic constructs, breed to be expendable warriors. But as favorite quote of mine from the movie is, \\\" you should have made them smart as well as fast\\\". Kurt Russell did a incredible job, his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined. Even when he falls in love with Sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions, and his tears after being expelled from the group, or his shuddering when he is given a hug, and his attachment to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded Todd of himself, and what he could have been if not for his selection to be a soldier.\", \"The first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts: the -thematic- conflict between the soldier Todd and his suppressed humanity, and the -physical- conflict between Todd and his bio-engineered replacement. Both sequences are quite gripping in different ways.  Peoples' screenplay falters somewhat by resolving the first of these arcs half-way through the movie, which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action romp.  Nonetheless, kudos to the makers for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to Kurt Russell who conveys much with very little.  Not a great film, but one worth seeing.\", \"Ok, basically this is a popcorn sci-fi movie, but from the outset its obvious that it has been directed with a great deal of intelligence. You can count about 10 clich\\u00e9s that the film is building up to, but it only delivers on about three of them, and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director hasn't assumed that you are an idiot. Kurt Russell's acting is truely superb and brings a depth from the character that is suprising and rewarding. Recommended if you've just seen something really stupid, and want to rebuild your faith!\", \"I watched this movie expecting what I got: good sci-fi cowboy stuff. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role.  Imagine trying to act under these two restraints: you have hardly any dialogue, and because you are playing a hardass, military robot, you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions! Howzat? Kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and duct-taped. In spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed, Russell pulls off an incredible characterization. His robot becomes human, in spite of the constraints. Great job!  As usual, Jason Isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villain--the one you'd love to see drawn and quartered. Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, motherly, and gorgeous. I'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty, but it was hard to take one's eyes off her. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was too small and limited.   Much of the plot is quite standard, with a fair amount of weaknesses, but as it does have a sci-fi comic book feeling, I don't see what's wrong with a few weaknesses. By the end of the story the good guy wins, and the appreciative audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction. Yes!  The sort of feeb who thinks that Russell didn't do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point.\", \"When I rented this movie to watch it, I knew that it was not going to be a mindbender movie. Instead I thought of it as a disbelief of reality where someone is going to get a serious beating. And you know what it worked. Kurt Russel did what I though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was. I recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action film.\", \"I don't remember this film getting a cinema release over here. I only saw it when it came onto cable. The film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines. Specifically one person, the way he gets replaced and dumped (literally) into an off-world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels.  Seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be Rambo in space, and would have been happy if it was.  I'm certainly happy it was'nt - Kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple. The scene where he's sitting outside the compound shows this, albeit the decision for two slow-mo replays detracts from the moment.  This is not a classic SF movie in the way that Bladerunner, Alien, Silent running, Logan's run or THX1138 were, however it is unfortunately the nearest I've seen to it in a long time.  He changes in the movie to a believable degree, he does'nt crack Arnie one liners, he does'nt become Snake Plissken and there is no definative happy ending.  That's why this film did'nt do well. It did'nt follow formula, and among a 18-25 year old target American audience, that's unforgivable as it was was'nt what they expected to see.  Fear and discipline.  Always.\", \"Kurt Russell is strong and (mostly) silent in this futuristic action-thriller from Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil.) Set on a garbage-dump planet, Soldier plays like a cross between Rambo and Shane, with Russell barely speaking as the title character, an \\\"obsolete\\\" genetic soldier left for dead. The supporting cast of colonists, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and a surprisingly hirsute Michael Chiklis, is able. They spend most of the movie being scared of Russell, and the rest of it running for their lives. Russell's performance here is one of the best he's ever given. With almost no words to say, he conveys emotion, feeling and meaning with looks and glances. It is almost a mime performance. When the action sequences kick into gear, he kicks ass--and does so in a strong, silent, matter-of fact way. There are flaws. Jason Scott Lee is brutish as a \\\"superior\\\" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs does a great impression of Frank Burns from M*A*S*H as a weaselly commanding officer, and Gary Busey busts a gut (and nearly busts his girdle) as Todd's mentor. This is an underrated, and excellent sci-fi flick, and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of Blade Runner--David Webb Peoples wrote both screenplays.\", \"David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson...if it already sounds weird to you, then you are right, because it is.  Peoples is known for his scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong, the value of life, etc... He covered these issues in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and pretty much in all of his screenplays there is something along those lines.  Paul Anderson's first successful movie was a violent thriller. Not surprisingly so have all of his other movies! And here is a violent thriller with moral implications!  Peoples' script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie. Soldiers trained from birth, taught to kill, and never had a normal life. They are replaced by better, genetically engineered soldiers and Todd, one of the original soldiers, is left on a planet and left for dead. There he must cope with a group of refugees, some want him to stay others hate him and there is an interesting drama here. BUT THEN...  ...The bullets start to fly as the new soldiers move onto the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people. Big, violent, loud action ensues and Peoples' script turns into an Anderson action-fest. It is hard to believe that the script was originally written that way, but the end product is better then I expected. Entertaining, somewhat, though admittedly not very, thought-provoking, and exciting once the action starts. 7/10  Rated R: a lot of violence\", \"In a future society, the military component does not have to recruit; rather, their candidates are chosen at birth, culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government. They are given over to the war machine, body and soul, for no reason other than to protect and serve; they have no personal identity other than a name and rank, and no autonomy whatsoever. This is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in `Soldier,' directed by Paul Anderson and starring Kurt Russell. The scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time, from preadolescence to adulthood. Russell is Sergeant Todd, the best of the best, and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign; he is what he was born to be, a soldier. But even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives when Todd and his peers are no longer the elite. A new generation of soldiers has been created, products of advanced genetics and technology, and Todd's generation is suddenly obsolete. What follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life, while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality, traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life: Fear and discipline. Russell gives a commanding performance as Todd, the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts. He has few lines in this movie, but Russell speaks volumes with his eyes. This role demonstrates that he is, in fact, one of the under-appreciated actors of our times; that he can disappear so entirely into the character of Todd is a credit to his ability, and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before. And he's given Todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype. Notable performances are also turned in here by Connie Nielsen (Sandra) and Jason Isaacs (Colonel Mekum). Rounding out the supporting cast are Jason Scott Lee, memorable as Caine 607, one of the new generation of soldiers; Sean Pertwee (Mace); Gary Busey (Captain Church); Michael Chiklis (Jimmy Pig); and Mark Bringleson (Rubrick). Anderson has delivered an action film with a message, a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science-fiction. `Soldier' reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact. It's an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives, like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference. Much like `1984,' and `Mad Max,' this movie, which is ultimately uplifting, is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of Universe in which we all must live together and share. I rate this one 7/10.\", \"OK, so Soldier isn't deep and meaningful like Blade Runner or as big budget as Terminator 2 but on the whole I found it quite enjoyable.  The fact that Kurt Russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant. I found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than Arnie's in the T films (and before I get comments yes I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same).  So to the film itself, a reasonable US/Brit cast are able to flesh out this little story. Not really sure if Gary Busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies, so was unable to decide whether I liked them or not. The colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving/gullible/cowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other.  Kurt Russell is good and unlike other comments I do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe Escape from LA - sequels are such fickle creatures!). Sean Pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble Sci-Fi lineage. And the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly.  If you see this on your TV schedule I would recommend giving it a chance. I don't think you will be disappointed.\", \"Soldier isn't a great movie, and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons. But I liked Soldier alot, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me.  First, the art direction is tight and well executed. As far as science fiction backdrops go, Soldier was doing things with more design then 90% the genre. The sets, costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed; I didn't love all of their future military style, but I was impressed with the effort. For me, this made the movie worth the time it took to watch.  Second, I'm a Kurt Russell fan. I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth ... The Barefoot Executive and his John Carpenter films. Soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of Sergeant Todd is an essential action hero. It's not an award winning role, but Kurt musters up convincing emotion with VERY little dialog.  Third, the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed. This isn't iron monkey, or even the matrix, but once again, it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre.  If you haven't seen it, and you like sci-fi action films, pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice. Just don't expect the next Bladerunner.\"], \"review_score\": [10, 10, 10, 8, 8, 7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 7, 10, 10, 10, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 7, 8, 7, 10, 10, 7, 7, 7, 8, 10], \"review_category\": [\"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 8.533333333333333}, \"Some Like It Hot\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0053291\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Wedding Date\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0372532\", \"total_review_count\": 8, \"total_rating_count\": 8, \"review_content\": [\"The best thing I can say about this film is that it is well-paced. It did not fall flat. The next best things are the supporting performances by the actor playing foppish groom-to-be Edward, the always marvelous Holland Taylor, and the actor playing Taylor's husband. The actor helping to critique Messing's potential outfits in an early scene brings a delightful absurd-yet-winning quality to the proceedings. Okay, that's about it on the positive side.  Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, is far more believable expressing contempt for Messing than in any scene where he's attempting to be either businesslike or supporting. As others noted, he appears to have no emotional investment in this enterprise other than wrapping it up as quickly as possible. Messing, on the other hand, sincerely tries to carry the film and to create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. She is adequate doing so, but is simply not strong enough an actress to pull all of this off without help. Give her an \\\"E\\\" for effort and a \\\"C+\\\" for achievement. Given Mulroney's indifference, the one thing that could've helped Messing would have been a brilliantly cavalier Irons-esquire performance from the actor playing her ex-fianc\\u00e9, Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is weak-kneed, mewling, and feckless.  If I tried to analyze this one any further, I'd obviously be paying more attention than most of the people involved. It's harmless enough to pass time if you have nothing else to do, and less obnoxious (and less creative) than The Wedding Singer, but you're much better off watching \\\"My Best Friend's Wedding\\\" again.\", \"No cinematic achievements here, however that's not even the important question. How does it fare in its endeavour to be a competent date movie--and star vehicle?  The formula requires the cute female lead a la Ryan or Aniston--check; there's a built-in TV audience!  Add thick-headed, compliant men, usually including the problem ex-boyfriend/fianc\\u00e9e--check.   Assemble a plot that maximizes the bankability of the stars. So far, so good.  What is the male lead to consist of? He has to make all the women in the movie and in the audience (and the gay flight stewards) instantly swoon. But...he cannot be so hunky as to threaten to the male audience, and he can't outshine the star. Roll cameras...  The problem is Messing thinks she's still in a sitcom...she has only one presentation: as the wide-eyed doormat that she's made a career out of. A capable actress might have pulled it off after the love scene, where things promptly nosedive into the soap suds.   You can't help feeling good for Mulroney...you can read it in his face that he sees through all of this. He's gotten all the respect of a lifetime .260 hitter. This time, he smacks one out to the warning track, and no one can figure out what to do, as he amusedly takes home plate.\", \"If Deborah Messing were not already cast as \\\"Grace\\\", this might be a tolerable film. However, it is simply another story of a frustrated spinster with issues, who hires a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney) she reads about in a Time magazine article to travel to London for her sister's London wedding. How new is this plot?  Neither funny, nor remotely romantic, the Wedding Date slides over the storyline of deceptive sex by bride and best man, and paid for escorts to pass off the film as Four Weddings without Hugh, and definitely, a dead end deal for the naive groom who is ignorant to the sexual history of his bride (Amy Adams). While Messing has perfected the repressed princess, 30- something woman with a failed relationship history, her neurotic and drunken moves on yet another faux beau is simply the restating of her TV series. If this woman is an actress, get a role that does not rehash what is already on prime time.  Lots of drunken female bonding, cricket visual jokes, and Mulroney in a towel (nice!), but the film is a bore with the obvious happy ending. Expected Messing sequel: Divorce Date.\", \"There have been so many many films based on the same theme. single cute girl needs handsome boy to impress ex, pays him and then (guess what?) she falls in love with him, there's a bit of fumbling followed by a row before everyone makes up before the happy ending......this has been done many times.  The thing is I knew this before starting to watch. But, despite this, I was still looking forward to it. In the right hands, with a good cast and a bright script it can still be a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours.  this was none of these.  this was dire.  A female lead lacking in charm or wit who totally failed to light even the slightest spark in me. I truly did not care if she \\\"got her man\\\" or remained single and unhappy.  A male lead who, after a few of his endless words of wisdom, i wanted to kill. Just to remove that smug look. i had no idea that leading a life of a male whore was the path to all-seeing all-knowing enlightenment.  A totally unrealistic film filled with unrealistic characters. none of them seemed to have jobs, all of them had more money than sense, a bridegroom who still goes ahead with his wedding after learning that his bride slept with his best friend....plus \\\"i would miss you even if we had never met\\\"!!!!! i could go on but i have just realised that i am wasting even more time on this dross.....I could rant about introducing a character just to have a very cheap laugh at the name \\\"woody\\\" but in truth that was the only remotely humorous thing that happened in the film.\", \"One wonders why anyone would try to rehash successful movie plots that have already been seen, like it's the case with this movie. \\\"The Wedding Date\\\" is one of the best examples of why not to even try to remake, under the guise of a new story, something that should have been let alone. If a project like this goes ahead with the studio big honchos' approval, then go all out with big stars and glossy production values, that way, people will come for the stars.  Alas, that's not what happens in this misguided attempt at comedy. The problem seems to be the way the screen writers have transplanted the story to London, when basically, this seems to be a typical American situation that not even the setting will be able to fix. Then there is the problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar!  Since the Kat and Nick have no conflict from the start, the viewer is not pulled into the film the way the creators thought they would be. It's clear that Kat will fall for Nick, and vice-versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best asset in \\\"Junebug\\\", comes across as a shallow girl who is willing to keep her lie going on and not come clean to the man that loves her and is going to marry her.  For anyone interested, the credits at the end of the film run for almost seven minutes!\", \"Too Much of Something Borrowed Grade B-  Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days at movie theaters every year. Because of this, movie studios tend to avoid releasing bigger budgeted films that weekend. Every few years a studio releases a counter-programming female skewing movie (2001's \\\"The Wedding Planner\\\") to compete with the big game. This Super Bowl weekend similarly titled \\\"The Wedding Date\\\" will try to find success and attract viewers not watching the game.   Sick of people feeling sorry for her, single-woman, Kat Ellis (Debra Messing, TV's \\\"Will and Grace\\\") hires male escort Nick ( Dermot Mulrony, \\\"About Schmidt\\\") to pose as her boyfriend for her sister's wedding in London. Her family has been giving her a hard time about her not being married, and her ex- fianc\\u00e9 of seven years, who dumped her without a reason, is the best man. To make him jealous Kat parades Nick around her ex to make him see what he is missing. But ultimately Nick helps Kat realize that she can open up, and let someone love her.  The film borrows too much from similar wedding movies. It is almost a carbon copy of 1999's \\\"Picture Perfect\\\" and mixes in scenes similar to \\\"The Wedding Planner\\\" and \\\"My Best Friends Wedding\\\". The movie also has a reverse \\\"Pretty Women\\\" theme going for it, and knowing her audience, the director makes clever references to that and other films.  \\\"The Wedding Date\\\" has all the clich\\u00e9d elements of a typical wedding movie, there is the stereotypical overbearing mother (Holland Taylor, \\\"Legally Blonde\\\"), and practically plagiarized wedding speeches by the family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal dinner. The twist at the ending has been done before, but it was something that wasn't completely expected. The real reason why Kat was dumped comes as a surprise and changes the direction of the film for the last half hour.  Even though \\\"The Wedding Date\\\" is predictable, it is able to stand on its own. Debra Messing, in her first lead role, proves she can be charming and funny. Dermot Mulrony has great chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of his dialogue was too corny and unrealistic. He is able to make best of what he is given, and be able to salvage the character.   By the use of many clever puns (often sexual), the film is actually funny. Although primarily a chick-flick the film has components everyone can enjoy. The feel good story, and humor make it the best date movie released in a long time.\", \"Seriously, I'm all for gooey romantic comedies and will get sucked into Miss Congeniality as easily as Goodfellas...but this movie? It doesn't make any sense!!!! And I'm not even talking about the willing suspension of disbelief kind of not making sense. Why does her family live in England? Or, at the very least, why doesn't she have a British accent? She's sure cozy with her dad and he's surprisingly forgiving of her not being around for the last two years. (On that subject, no one ever makes much of a deal about her being away for so long). And what was with the goofy outfits at the bachelorette party? I'm not even going to get into the fact that the escort she paid for falls in love with her--that could've been overcome by better movie-making. I'm just saying that the characters, the setting, and the plot aren't fleshed out enough to make an even somewhat cohesive story. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is the filmmaker's consistent use of the most unflattering angles on Deborah Messing's nose--I'd have sued the filmmakers if I were her! I mean, honestly, I'm all for women being who they are, but why, in seven loyal years of Will and Grace viewing, have I not ever noticed how incredibly odd her nose is? Oh! Because those producers are kind to her! This movie, like my other least favorite movie ever, Armageddon, is the fault of the filmmakers, not the actors. I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better writer, director, and producer.  This easily gets my vote as one of the worst movies I've ever wasted time on. I'm just glad a friend loaned me her DVD, so all I wasted was time. If there were a way to make this review ZERO stars, I'd do it.\", \"For romantic comedies, I often judge the quality of the film based upon the mistiness of my eyes by the end of the experience. Unfortunately for \\\"The Wedding Date,\\\" I can only rate the film with 4 out of 10 possible tears.  My apologies to fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I did not see much chemistry between their two characters. The premise of the film is a reverse \\\"Pretty Woman,\\\" with Dermot playing the role of Nick, a high-priced male escort hired by Debra's character Kat to accompany her to England for her sister's wedding. A romantic relationship presumably develops between patron and client. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And there weren't enough romantic sparks flying in the relationship of Nick and Kat.  In a supporting role, Amy Adams was a standout as Kat's sister. Whenever Amy came on screen, she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the film's energy. Perhaps if Amy Adams had been cast in the role of Kat, the film might have had more dynamism. But as it turned out, instead of reaching for Kleenex, I was looking for the Visine in attempt to at least pretend that this film had some genuine sentiment and romance.\"], \"review_score\": [4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4], \"review_category\": [\"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 2.25}, \"Sounder\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0069303\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0158983\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"There's one problem with television: You can't say &#*%, or $@&%, or #^&@%$. So what did Trey Parker and Matt Stone -- the creators of the hit mature animated series \\\"South Park\\\" -- turn? The movies, where anything goes (just about). Although the idea for a \\\"South Park\\\" movie probably came about before the idea to exploit the MPAA's more flexible ratings system for the TV show's impeccable satire, it's no less the perfect choice to bring the little Colorado mountain town and its foul-mouthed children to the big screen in \\\"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.\\\"  Using the movies, Parker and Stone immediately come out singing (yes, this is a movie musical) that the movies are responsible for society's cultural education. The third graders Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny all go to see the new Terrence & Philip movie, based on the show's fictional hit Canadian TV show about two farting roommates, mirroring the experience of the likely underaged crowd going to see the \\\"South Park\\\" movie, and there you have the brilliance of \\\"South Park\\\" and this film.  The Terrence & Philip movie introduces the kids to a whole world of swears and insults they never knew before (because they couldn't use them on TV) and they start using it in talking back to teachers and their parents. As usual, the parents of South Park take things too seriously and point the finger for their children's bad behavior at well, Canada, who else? Single-handedly, Parker and Stone introduce the Canada joke to Americans.  The film doesn't crusade for allowing bad language, but rather shows how silly it is to take language so seriously, particularly when Mothers Against Canada invokes a war with our neighbors to the north.  Parker and Stone should take their act to Broadway with the quality of the music in this movie, from the Oscar-nominated \\\"Blame Canada\\\" to \\\"What Would Brian Boitano Do?\\\" They do enlist the help of the talented Tony winner Marc Shaiman, but the show has always been known for its musical prowess. The songs are memorable, fun and break up the film well considering its structured like a long television special.  Fans of the show get exactly what they'd expect from \\\"South Park\\\" including some extra goodies and appearances from all the most liked characters. The language of course is off the charts, but the childish ignorance of adult content (Stan seeks the clitoris after Chef tells him that's how you keep a girl around) is there too. By film's end it's not the sharpest satire that the show has ever delivered, but it was obviously the perfect plot choice for making \\\"South Park\\\" into a movie, not just picking some random story line, but maximizing the satire potential of the new medium. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com\", \"Come on, people who thought this movie was bad are taking it too seriously. This movie is so funny ! it shows the fact that swearing is funny, well its only funny if south park does it. awesome movie. it had a classic offensive plot and this time making fun of Canadians as potty heads. ahem, Terrance and Phillip... so basically, the 4 boys watch the Terrance and Phillip movie which is very rude yet hilarious, so after they watch it they become vulgar mouths and the south park parents are very angry and rages a war against Canada for making children become potty mouths. and the great factor is that the plot was used so well and the climax is just jaw dropping. the musical is very fun and lots of fun to sing with it. And the very impressive event is that they explore the characters really well in the movie. Like Satan, Saddam Hussein. Warning this film is highly racist,vulgar, adult and graphic. Come on Matt and trey make a second one !!!\", \"i had never watched the south park series before seeing the movie. a friend put the movie on and i was blown away. by the time the first musical number started, i was rolling on the floor laughing. i couldn't believe how smart and stupid it was at the same time.   i feel like south park actually explores a lot of social and political issues way more than other serious movies that try to get deep.  some of the movie is really really stupid and that is funny. and some of it really does address bigger issues, including censorship, war and religion.  somehow fart jokes just make it work. don't ask me why.   if you are an independent thinker who likes ridiculous comedy you will love this movie!\", \"I don't watch the show, and the movie had me laughing for the majority of the running time! I didn't even expect to like it as much as I did. Even the musical numbers are good.\", \"Ordinarily I try to avoid gratuitous obscenity, but in this movie it is a necessary and integral part of the story.  Between laughing, I must admit to watching in frequent open-mouthed admiration at some of the brilliant ideas.  This cartoon presents several levels of ideas, including, as strange as it might seem to anyone turned off by the language, some rather profound philosophical notions.  Having once resided in North (brrrr) Dakota, I always get a kick out of jokes about Canada (it's not really a country, you know) and Canadians, who seem to love their socialized medicine but come south to the States to buy their groceries and liquor and tobacco so as to avoid the obscenely high taxes that pay for all the \\\"free\\\" \\\"services\\\" from the Canadian government. (And frequently they come for the more readily available medical care.)   In fact, one of my favorite jokes came from a waitress in a restaurant in Grand Forks, N.D.: What is the difference between a Canadian and a canoe? A canoe might tip. (It's a joke very popular in Florida, too.)  All of which might seem to have nothing to do with this movie, but deep down ... it seems to have nothing to do with this movie.  Anyway, I loved \\\"South Park,\\\" and try to catch the nightly replays of the TV show.  Not every show is a gem, but often enough there is a spark of brilliance that I must express my admiration and respect for its creators, and especially for this longer, uncut, and uncensored movie.  Not for the squeamish, as the clich\\u00e9 goes, and certainly not for the easily offended, but it is for anyone who can appreciate an inventive story and some really exceptional music.\", \"parker and stone push their vision right over the edge and make fart jokes all the way down. i can't even begin to tell you how obscene and vulgar this movie was, because the audience and i were laughing so hard, we'd miss parts. the only people who should really be offended by this are saddam hussein (but not really since he's a... anyways) and winona ryder (since her piece didn't make any sense). i just really want to see the versions that the MPAA jerks didn't give an R...\", \"If you carry all of your sensibilities into the theatre with you will surely have them all crushed. This movie was made to make fun of itself, its viewers, and most others in between. They spare no one- and it's beautiful.  The story would stand alone (in the world of South Park). The cracks, the singing numbers (M'kay), and the eyebrow raising humor just add to the enjoyment of the film.  Since most of the jokes did not have the traditional set-up/punchline format, I embarrassingly found myself being the only one in the theatre laughing through much of the movie.  Best of all, the movie really does present a relatively accurate microcosm of American ignorance and intolerance as well as the -soon to be- trademark humor of *the next generation*. The messages of the irony of American Freedom of Speech is also a focus of the movie (if you could claim it to have focus). Overall, it was a funny, abrasive comedy that will keep you laughing again and again.  This will be the movie I'll show my children when they get old enough to ask, \\\"What was your childhood like daddy?\\\" -If they can handle it (but I think we all know that, by then, they will be desensitized well past the extremes of this movie).\", \"The movie version of \\\"South Park\\\" had me --- and this is not exaggeration -- laughing so hard I was falling out of my chair. I was laughing so hard it *hurt*.  A) For using satire to make valid points about censorship and individual responsibility, this is the best movie I've ever seen.  B) It's the best movie musical made since MGM left the mass-production business. The multi-national production number of \\\"'Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch' in D Minor\\\" is worth the price of admission.  C) It's a fabulous, fearless boot to the butt of Political Correctness.  Roger Ebert wrote that he felt very guilty about laughing, not knowing if it all \\\"had a point.\\\" He apparently was buying popcorn when Kyle flat out stated the point of the movie: that parents need to quit blaming \\\"bad influences\\\" and start *being parents* by talking to their kids.  The gags are non-stop, the songs are terrific and there is an unbelievably touching moment involving Kenny near the end. Ignore the current lameness of the TV show; this is a five-star movie (even on a four-star system).\", \"I have been a longtime fan of the controversial TV show South Park, and I went to see the feature-length movie the first night it came out. Well, Trey Parker has done it again - shocked me to the point that my jaw almost hit the floor (and I do NOT shock easily).  Even those (myself included) who believe that the show has lost its novelty (the new episodes have kinda sucked lately) - are in for a treat with this one.  \\\"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut\\\" has absolutely NO barriers in its comedy - it pokes fun at gays, straights, blacks, whites, Jews, Christians, the handicapped... you name it. It even pokes a LOT of fun at Canadians (which I am), which makes it a hilarious free-for-all that is NOT for children or the easily offended.  Most of the characters are here (except Mr. Hankey - a shame, but I can't really see where Parker could have written him in), and there's a LOT of hilarious musical numbers (including the side-splitting Terrance and Phillip song, \\\"Uncle F--ka\\\"). If you think you can handle it, go see this movie by all means. If you're prudish and easily offended, stay home and rent \\\"The Horse Whisperer\\\".  \", \"When Trey Parker and Matt Stone were writing the script for the movie, they had to make a decision if they wanted to \\\"dumb down\\\" material for the non-fans. Instead, they decided to make this movie for the fans-and by God, this has got to be one of the funniest movies I have seen all decade. There was never a dull moment, the audience was uproarious, and I was laughing harder than I have in years.  Even going as far as to top There's Something About Mary in its crudeness and extreme vulgarity, South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut does what few TV-to-movies do: make a jump to the next level by pushing the obscenity to the limit.  I'll try and not spoil too much. The four kids go to see the Terrance & Phillip movie, \\\"Asses of Fire.\\\" There is a musical number featured in the movie-within-a-movie which had the audience rolling, the lyrics consisting almost entirely of the f-word (and the TV show's bleeps are discarded for the film). The boys soak in the movie's naughty language and come out spouting forbidden obscenities. Soon other children see the movie. In the school classroom, there is an eruption of swearing and the boys are sent to the school guidance counselor, Mr. Mackey, who calls in their mothers to make them aware of what the Terrance & Phillip movie has done to the kids. They form The Mothers Against Canada and try to have Terrance & Phillip executed. Canada defends its humor while the United States laughs at them, and Canada retaliates by bombing the Baldwin brothers (very clever). Soon Canada and the U.S. are engaging in full-scale war.  Meanwhile, Kenny dies (not surprisingly) and goes to Hell, where Saddam Hussein and Satan are in a homosexual love affair. Saddam only wants sex every five minutes and Satan wants to be loved. Their scenes in bed are a reason why kids should not see this movie. Back on Earth, the kids form a group to save Terrance & Phillip, \\\"La Resistance\\\" (obviously paying homage to Les Mis\\u00e9rables) and make a plan to rescue Terrance & Phillip from the big USO show, where they are to executed. Guests at the USO meeting include Big Gay Al and Winona Ryder (who is happy to demonstrate her famous \\\"ping-pong ball\\\" trick). The kids attempt to sneak into the show and free Terrance & Phillip.  This movie will shock you. You will not believe some of the jokes in this movie. It will offend many people. The film takes equal shots at Jews, blacks, Canadians, Bill Gates, and Jar Jar Binks, to name a few. I'm quite sure many will be offended by \\\"The Mole\\\" character and what the military's plans are for the 14th battalion (snicker).  Fans will undoubtably love this movie. We finally see Kenny without his parka and hear him speak, and there's none of those annoying bleeps. I am a fan. I loved it. In fact, I'm going as far as to recommend it as a candidate for one of the best of 1999, let alone best comedy of the decade. This movie is non-stop laughs and it's very, very entertaining. It's not all toilet humor, either. The creators manage to get a message through, and there are large satirical tones concerning our modern society.  I paused while writing my review to consider people who aren't fans of the show and what they will think, and I have kept those in mind. There is a lot of swearing and a lot of frankly gratuitous sexual material. I salute Trey Parker and Matt Stone for having the guts to push the R rating to its boundaries. This film is fun for movie buffs and those who love political humor. And so, I am awarding it four stars. In these trying times, we need a good laugh or two.\", \"The Southpark movie is pretty good. It is layed out like a musical, and had many catchy (if not raunchy) songs. There is A LOT of blue language, so don't bring the kids. There were some really funny parts, (I.E. Bill Gates.) but on the whole it was like a long episode of the show without the censors.  Also I found it ironic that the plot of the movie was based on how americans can take massive amounts of violence in movies as long as they don't say any naughty words. Which is proably why the rating committee wanted to give this movie an NC-17 rating because they slam on them so much. Anyway, very funny, very crude and very entertaning.\", \"A hilarious musical besting Trey's earliest forray into film \\\"Alferd Packer, The Musical\\\" (also in this DB, though that one not R rated) This is NOT..I repeat NOT a movie for the kids. And yes they will take every measure possible to get you to bring them. It is hugely vulgar and uses combinations of profanity I have never heard before. Beware the \\\"Video Sleep Over\\\" parties come September. However, you are not going to be able to keep the tykes away from exposure completely, so best to talk to them aboot the content and language first. Do the job that the story is aboot. Parent your children.  That being said, the film is one of the funniest of the season. Funnier, even, than The Spy Who Shagged me...sorry comrade Mike. Myers wouldn't be welcome in the world that develops around South Park Colorado. Nor would I, as we are both Canadians, and Canada is a four letter word in this SP.  The songs in the flick are well conceived and executed. Parker is a latent musical director with a great sense of humor. \\\"It's Easy, MMMkay\\\", \\\"Blame Canada\\\", the \\\"Uncle F**ka\\\" song and dance, and \\\"What Would Brian Boitano Do?\\\" are good examples of his prowess. You even detect a hint of \\\"All I Really Want\\\" from Alferd Packer poking into a song. You soon become desensitized to the language (for good or bad) and can appreciate the cleverness of the lyrics and staging.  I recommend this to anyone who has consciously or unconsciously hummed \\\"Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo\\\". But beware where you choose to sing some of these songs.  There are some subjects and comments which will make some feel uneasy, like the scenes in Hell but I think they're cleverly designed to bring some of our phobias to bear and beg the question \\\"What do you expect from Hell? What's taboo in Hell anyway?\\\"  I'm still alive and kicking so the movie won't kill you.  \", \"i think South Park is the funniest cartoon ever made. it may be rude but thats the best part of it. simply Trey Parker has done an excellent job! the tv show, movie, songs and everything else are great and i must add Cartman is the funniest cartoon charecter of all time and his voice is so cute! People who stay away from South Park should at least try watching it once and see what they were missing...\", \"I've been watching the show since it started back in '97, so of course i went and saw the movie when it opened. I was a little concerned when hearing that it was done as a musical, as all the voices are pretty unique and wasn't sure how they would convert over to singing, but was pleasantly surprised. The songs are very well done, and the 'singing' voices of the characters are all actually pretty good!  I was definitely excited to also see what they would do without needing to be censored for TV. The comedy of the TV show shines through, and you can easily see how \\\"different\\\" the authors are when they're not required to keep some things out for TV viewing.  As the show continues to do well and keeps coming back for more, they should definitely make another one!\", \"I, personally loved this movie! The rudeness, vagueness, and profanity just makes it better than expected! If every movie was like this, not only would the world be a much better place, but I would be going to the movie theater every day, instead of spending all my money at Best Buy! Kids shouldn't watch this at all. That's the only downside. They can't see how funny this movie really is! The good thing about Bigger, Longer, & Uncut, is that they can make fun of everyone and anyone they want, and the people will be too busy enjoying this movie to do anything about it! So, this movie is about when two Canadians, Terrance and Phillip, make a movie. The profanity angers Kyle, Cartman, Stan, and Kenny's mothers (but mostly Kyle's) after they see it, and they tell them never to see it again. They disobey, (as usual) and it leads to Kenny trying to attempt one of the stunts, (catching your \\\"fart\\\" on fire)leading to his death when a Doctor replaces his heart with a baked potato. This angers the mothers' even more, ultimately leading to a war against Canada, and the execution of Terrance and Phillip. To stop the execution, Cartman, Stan, and Kyle launch \\\"Le Resitance\\\" to stop the war, stop the execution of Terrance and Phillip, and stop their blood from reaching the ground or Sadaam Hussein and Satin from taking over the world!\", \"Oh My God, I liked this movie soo much! Really, ''South Park:Bigger Longer & Uncut''is hilarious,and only people who doesn't have any sense of humor are not going to appreciate it! The story itself does not have much sense, but who cares? The songs are so funny (specially Terrance and Philiph's one) and we have great scenes, like Saddam Hussein and the Devil fighting because of sexual problems, or all the students who are classmates of Eric, Kyle, Stan and Kenny saying lots, but LOTS of cursed words! Like all South Park's episodes, we have a critic inside the joke: in this movie's case, is to criticize mainly the hypocrite north American society, among other things.\", \"Eminem meeting Disney and a horror film (you'll know what I mean when you've seen the film), it really has not much of a plot, but it still is entertaining. Due to a few comic lines a few nice songs and a good moral. Well of course you might consider it offensive but I don't (OK I'm from Holland and we've brought you Paul Verhoeven) but still, you can't be offended if you have a sense of humour and if you remember this is ONLY a film.  The message of this film (the moral) is the same that the makers of South Park have tried to bring over in their series, only they stuffed it in a better box with this film.  7 out of 10  To all the people who criticised this movie, because of it's bad language, violence etceteras: You have NOT learned a thing and you'd better watch this movie again.\", \"South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut is unique, as it is likely the only movie adaptation of a television show that was popular with both critics and audiences. It is also one of the funniest animated films ever made. The film takes satiric aim at American culture, through the premise of a war between the US and Canada started by an \\\"obscene\\\" Canadian film. Like MASH, South Park contrasts the perceived obscenity of language and sexuality with the true obscenity of war and violence. The film has become even more poignant in these dark times of wars fought under false pretenses.   The film is also a musical and benefits from the catchy tunes of Trey Parker and Marc Shaiman. Highlights include the \\\"Blame Canada\\\" song and a Stanley Kubrick/Anthony Burgess tribute involving the V-chip. It is an excellent film overall and is among my favorite animated features. 10/10\", \"SPOILER ALERT! This is one of the finest satiric cartoons ever made. I am convinced that South Park is the best show on TV (and the only excuse to turn on that disgusting Comedy Central [AKA The Beer and Sex Channel,]) but some people wonder if the movie is as good as the show. Take my word for it, it isn't. It's ten times better. In the movie, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny see an R-rated film starring their favorite Canadian actors, Terrance and Philip. The movie is entitled Asses of Fire, and if I may quote Arthur Taussig, the title is the least offensive thing about it. In the opening scene of Asses of Fire, we discover why it was rated R. I won't give away one of the funniest parts of the movie, but I'll just say that I didn't know you could use that many obscenities in only three minutes. When the movie ends, the boys leave the theatre repeating all the words they've heard in the film. Not knowing what the words mean, they continue this behavior the next day at school. Their teacher sends them to the guidance counselor who subsequently calls their mothers. As those who watch the show may have guessed, Sheila Brosfloski, Kyle's mother, is outraged and begins a campaign to have the film banned.  It's general pop-culture knowledge that Kenny McCormick is killed in nearly EVERY episode of South Park. One can naturally assume that his death in the movie would be the Kenny-death-to-end-all-Kenny-deaths. It is, but unlike his frequent deaths in the show, his death in the movie is a huge contributing factor to the plot. This may be a slight spoiler (if you can call the way in which Kenny dies a spoiler.) The boys end up seeing the movie again, and Kenny is killed while imitating something he saw in the film that may be too inappropriate say in this review. He is banished to Hell for skipping church to see the film, and we discover that Satan and Saddam Hussein are in a homosexual love affair. In this relationship, Satan is surprisingly warm and caring and wants to communicate with Saddam, but Saddam just wants sex. The conversations between these two characters throughout the film are hilarious. Meanwhile, back on Earth, Sheila Brosfloski's movement to have Terrance and Philip banned has spun out of control. Canada is blamed for all of the problems of America's youth, America is preparing to literally wage war against Canada, all Canadian-American citizens are sent to death-camps, and Terrance and Philip are scheduled to be executed. Back in Hell, Kenny listens to a conversation between Satan and Saddam. Bible readers know the seven signs of the end of the world. The fall of an empire, the coming of a comet, etc. We discover that when the blood of Terrance and Philip touches American soil, Satan and Saddam Hussein will ascend from Hell and rule the earth. It is now up to Stan, Kyle, and Cartman to save humanity from the horrors of every Christian's worst nightmare, and his boyfriend, George W. Bush's worst nightmare. This film is more than hilarious. I am convinced that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the funniest individuals in America. This film is an animated musical, but parents beware, it doesn't bare the Disney family-friendly stamp of approval. The best songs in the film are \\\"Up There,\\\" \\\"I'm Super,\\\" \\\"What Would Brian Boitano Do?,\\\" and the infamous \\\"Blame Canada,\\\" which was nominated for an Oscar. The best voice jobs by the creators were Saddam Hussein (Matt Stone,) and Satan (Trey Parker.) I could watch this film twenty times every day and never tire of it. Caution: while this film is animated, it is certainly not for the kiddies. It is filled with vulgar language, but it is not gratuitous. The language used is the purpose of the film. The moral of the film is that no matter what words your children learn from a film, it is not the filmmaker's job to raise your child. It's an anti-censorship film. It is the up to the parent to put it into context and punish accordingly. I would recommend this film to everyone who is not easily offended or an extreme Christian, YOU WILL BE OFFENDED. If you're into satirical cartoons, or just want to see Canadians drop bombs on Alec Baldwin, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is a must-see.  \", \"South Park is one of my favorite TV shows, so I decided I had to see the movie. Once the movie started I was into it very quickly. (This part contains Spoilers) In the beginning, Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny sneak into an R-rated Canadian movie that is made by their idols, Terrence and Philip. The film is a little bit more than just a lot of foul language. After the kids see it, they start swearing all the time and tell their friends about it. Soon, a lot of kids in the country see it and also start swearing. The parents become very concerned about this. One day Kenny does something similar to what happens in the movie and ends up getting killed. The kid's Moms decide to start a war against Canada and execute Terrence and Philip. If I told you the rest, it would ruin the fun of the movie.  This movie is a musical with some very clever and hilarious musical numbers, one of which was nominated for an academy award. The storyline is very clever, looking at how much came out of such a simple idea. At the same time this movie does have some good points that were brought up, such as how people think media makes kids to do things, and about freedom of speech. This isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it is definitely a clever movie with some huge laughs and good messages.\", \"-and I say that being a person whose hated musicals all his life with a fiery passion  -The movie chronicles the events that takes place after the gang sneaks in to see an R rated movie. the movie is based on their favorite Canadian TV show \\\"Terrence and Phillips: Asses of Fire.\\\" the movie contains lots of crude humor and vulgar language, and teaches them how to use the F word and other offensive language in a brand new way. pretty soon all the kids see the movie and start cussing like sailors, and this is where the problem comes from. all the parents lead by Kyle's mom decide to protest the movie and the protest soon turns into an all out war between Canada and USA. meanwhile Kenny dies and ends up in hell and whiles there he discovers that Satan and his boyfriend Saddam Hussein *LOL* are plotting to invade earth. and that's the f*cked up plot in a nutshell  -The whole movie is told through a series of wonderful songs sang by the characters. from the Danny Elfmanesque \\\"Blame Canada\\\" to the laugh out loud \\\"Kyle's Mom's A *female dog*\\\" all the songs in the movie are just perfect and fits it like a glove. the humor is the same as that of the TV show, and by that i mean stereotypical racial jokes, fart jokes, gay jokes, pop culture jokes, and sexual jokes. the animation is also the same which must be great news for the studio because by doing that the movie was made very cheaply. Trey and Matt like always do the voices for about 70% of the characters in the movie, but this time they have some celebrity friends to help them out. I heard that Clooney did a voice for the movie but i couldn't recognize it. The best thing about this movie and also the TV show is of course Cartman. he's let loose in this movie and completely uncut so we get to hear him in his whole anti-semitic glory. Later on the movie his filthy mouth ends up saving the day.   -I love this movie. it's exactly my type of humor, it doesn't hold anything back and is wonderfully filthy. all the jokes whether racial or homosexual jokes are simply meant as just JOKES and nothing more. conservative people who find that kind of humor to be crude can go listen to Bill O' Reilly BS them to death.   -Don't blame Canada guys, that's where Sarah Polley lives :)\", \"First of all, let me preface this by saying that I am not a huge fan of South Park the TV show. While I find the TV show amusing, I do not watch it more than once every few months. So I had doubts about the movie, but my brother insisted I watch it. So I did and ended up purchasing the DVD the next day.  All comedy aside, this is one of the most masterfully written movies I have ever seen. The songs are hilariously funny and the way that they incorporate all the individual songs into one masterpiece is sheer genius. Probably one of the best musicals I have seen.  As for the humor, don't watch this if you are easily offended, because you will be offended.  Funny, funny, funny. 10 stars.\", \"I saw this movie and laughed and laughed and laughed. I was shocked and offended. It was one of the bravest movies of the year, nevertheless decade, or history. It was definitely bigger and longer. It certainly seemed uncut, even though it wasn't. See June 29 studio brief. It was hilarious.  Plot: The movie had a great plot. I won't give it all away, but it is definitely big. It starts with Stan, Cartman, Kyle, Kenny, and Kyle's little brother sneaking into the Terrance Phillip movie, \\\"A**es of Fire,\\\" which has been rated R. They learn all kinds of swear words and use them at all times. The rest of South Park kids see it also, and by the next school day, the parents find out and totally hate the movie. They form a group against the movie. It goes out from there. There is also a plot with Kenny going to hell, and finding Saddam Hussein and Satan in love. Saddam is a hornball. And Satan regrets the whole relationship.  Crudity: Definitely for adults only. It probably has the most swear words than any other movie this year. It has cartoon nudity. It has breasts and wriggling penises. All cartoon, of course. It has violence galore by the end. Do not take your kids to see this, or be prepared to feel uncomfortable. All theaters must enforce the carding laws for this one. However, if none of this will offend you to the point of hatred, do not see this. It also has racism, sexism, and offends every group out there from the Gays to the MPAA to the parents.  As a whole: The funniest movie so far of 1999. I laughed so hard. I found it only mildly offensive personally, but then I also love the movie \\\"Pink Flamingos.\\\" I cannot recommend this movie to everyone. I can recommend it to those who are not offended easily. This does not include the people who feel brave because they survived \\\"There's Something About Mary.\\\" Parents will not like this movie unless they are completely open-minded, and I recommend not seeing it with your children. However, it is wonderful. I loved the musical format that they chose. Everywhere there is a song. Also stay past the credits, there is an after-scene. It is trying to be a \\\"Pink Flamingos.\\\" I love it but can only recommend it to the group from 17-30, male.----------------------------10\", \"its easy to see why a lot of people may be offended by this film. After all, it makes fun of black people, Jews, women , Canada, homosexuality, homeless people, fat people and of course Barbara Streisand...miss anything out!!?! yet if you like it you can't help but admit that the movie is comedy genius. The opening 10 minutes had me rolling in the aisles \\\"how would you like to suck my b#lls, Mr garrison?\\\" and the song \\\"its easy mmmmkay\\\" being some of the highlights. the jokes while repetitive (based on swearing or insulting someone) never get old and the genius of ideas such as \\\"operation get behind the darkies\\\" while being offensive are undeniably funny. the only people who would rate this movie any less than at least 7 are the pathetic types who'll say \\\"oh its to vulgar and rude and offensive\\\". thats the point! so if you're someone who can laugh at yourself (which we should all be able to in an un-serious movie such as this) and want to witness some amazing moments of comedy genius than this is for you. special shout out to the creators of south park for the character Eric cartman, the real star of this movie who would be up there on par with homer simpson for all time greatest comedy character if not for his foul mouth and habit of insulting well..everyone! 10/10 from me for all the nights this ones cheered me up with out fail.\", \"Nothing can prepare you for this film. It's a one off. Undoubtedly the best film I have ever seen. I truly laughed until I cried in the cinema showing, bought the video and the soundtrack - which I never do - and have watched it several times over. The political undertones are frighteningly poignant. The idea is brilliant. It's the antidisney. It's a fart in the face of those who wage war in the name of decency. It's a bunch of foul mouthed kids spewing profanity. It's better than good versus evil; it challenges us to asses the criteria upon which we judge good and evil. It pokes fun at everyone, white, black, Jewish, Christian - but particularly the stupid and the bigoted. by ridiculing the fuss that is made against profanity, the writers have safeguarded themselves against adverse publicity from complaints. It's what the film is about in the first place. My only complaint is that this film is so brilliant that it made Team America seem tame.\", \"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Un-cut is a great movie. Not only because the TV show (South Park) is one of the best animated shows of the 90's but also because of it's comedy, political and social satire, and though you can't see it right away, a look into censorship and what bad and good qualities it's doing to American life. And it also shows that Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem just like a bunch of comedy writers and composers, but that they could be truly freedom fighters by show-casing this film.  The story is about the four boys of South Park (Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Kenny McCormick, and Eric Cartman) and after they go into a rated R Terrence and Phillip flick, they start to use their new founded dirty words to excessive use. Since the film is Canadian, a war breaks out between Canada and America. Kenny dies (thats not a giveaway because on the TV show Kenny dies in every episode) and winds up in hell to find Sadaam Hussein and Satan as gay lovers. Both plot sides are very hilarious (depending on if you watch the show) and it's very satirical (if you don't believe me, just look at Bill Gates getting shot in the movie).  The Movie seems quite content in it's dirty foul-ness and funny comedy musical type way to make us laugh (not that thats a bad thing), but I think that Matt and Trey are tying to tell us something with this film. It is a wakeup call to America that if censorship doesn't change soon, we might actually go to war with a country over something as arbitrary as censorship and freedom. Or... it's just a good old fashioned comedy with fart jokes, sex humor, and a Winona Ryder playing ping-pong in her private area. Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong. Never-the-less, this film is one of the best of the year. A++\", \"If you're not a fan of non-stop swearing, crude humor, musicals, satire, violence, or just South Park in general then don't watch this. Trey Parker and Matt Stone hold nothing back during this movie. Everything they can't get away with on television they do so with Bigger, Longer, and Uncut. Weather anyone believes it or not BLU is a musical in every respect. From the intro song(Small Mountain Town) to the money number(Uncle F*cker, which you will find yourself singing in the shower), this is a musical top to bottom. The movie kicks off with the kids going to see the Terrance and Phillip movie where they hear so many bad words they become corrupted and begin to use them in their every day lives. Kyle's mom is so outraged by this film that she, along with the rest of South Park, manage to get the United States to go to war with Canada for sending the Terrance and Phillip movie to America. Stan, Kyle, and Cartmen form a resistance group to fight their parents and the war, and Kenny goes to Hell where Satan and Saddam (who are gay lovers in the movie) plan on taking over Earth by using the war. This movie is so great it's hard not to love it, especially since it made the Book of World Records for 399 swear words and 128 offensive gestures. Parker and Stone out-did themselves with this movie. You'll laugh until you hurt.\", \"What can I say but OH MY GODS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had heard rumors about this movie's extremities (no pun intended) and that it was much more...ahem...wild than the t.v. show. Now, I've only seen a handful of the television shows, and they're pretty racy and raunchy, but I've always liked what I've seen. It's definitely not a show (or movie!) for kids. Or the faint of heart, or the easily offended. But then again, if you know that you're an easily offended person DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE!   I loved this movie. Granted, I have to admit that I was shocked and surprised through 95% of it. But it was great nonetheless. It was funny and vulgar and said pretty much everything in a manner that was NOT politically correct. But then again, aren't we all getting pretty sick of political correctness?  I think one of the things that gets most of us, (at least myself) is that when we were kids that age, we never would have gone around saying half of what those kids did. Or, if we did, we did our best not to get caught! Of course, I was only ever threatened with getting my mouth washed out with soap...not my mother starting a war with a foreign country!   The musical numbers were great! They were very upbeat and will stick in the minds of viewers for years to come. In the future, when we're all sitting behind our desks (or whatever jobs we may have), we'll notice that we'll be humming certain catchy tunes and when we stop to wonder what it is, we'll remember the songs from South Park both with humor and with horror that we're actually humming them out in the \\\"civilized\\\" world. The scene I think the best for musical numbers was where several of the different songs were going on at one time. It was very \\\"Les Miserables\\\" like (I saw the musical so I know what I'm talking about) in a very sick and twisted sort of way. It was simply funny and light hearted.  This movie poked fun at just about everything in the book. Nothing was spared. Not Christianity, not different racial stereotypes, and certainly not the gay community. But none of it was handled in a fashion to be hateful or humiliating. In my opinion, all the jabs were meant to get people to see that there shouldn't be the divisions that there are and when people get separated, they leave themselves open to ridicule and criticism. Rather if we all came together and put aside the divisions and stereotypes, then perhaps we could all see the humor in remarks and jabs like the ones made in this movie.   As for the political statement: it's true, you know. This country (as are many others) is always looking for something or someone else to blame for all the \\\"troubles.\\\" We as a nation are hypersensitive to every little thing and just about everything is taboo. From swearing to being able to purchase certain adult oriented \\\"toys,\\\" a person can't do anything in this country without being censored or \\\"forbidden\\\" to. It's sad when a state's laws or a person's hysteria keeps people from their constitutional right of free speech and the like. And this is what this movie was trying to point out. I agree with the person who is his review of this movie wrote, \\\"They're just words\\\" about the swearing in the movie. And that's all they are.   I give this movie a 10 for its humor, its musical numbers and its obvious statements. I think that everyone (who has an open mind) should go see this movie...and then go again and take someone who doesn't have an open mind so that it can be opened by the hilarious things said and done in this movie.\", \"I was not a fan of South Park before I saw BL&U, nor was I a fan of movie musicals. Well, I'm still not a fan of musicals, but I'm a fan of *this* musical, and am grateful to Parker and Stone for demonstrating that it's still possible to make a great movie on one's own terms.  For this movie, unlike the usual feature-length adaptation of a pop culture phenomenon, not only lives up to its pedigree, it wildly exceeds it. Yes, the movie does recycle many of the show's jokes, but it does so in new yet relevant contexts that keep the material funny if you are familiar with the South Park world. If you aren't familiar with that world (as I wasn't before seeing the movie), the gags are simultaneously accessible yet often subtle.  Subtle? Yes, many of the gags are. Indeed, one of the pleasures of owning a copy of the movie is having the ability to review the movie, in slo-mo if necessary, and discover throwaway sight gags that one has missed in the delirium of watching this anarchic satire the first time through. (And if you have the DVD, you can add subtitles to catch many of the songs' often elusive lyrics.)  Then there's the music. What is it about movie musicals that attracts great satiric minds? Not since Pynchon's \\\"Gravity's Rainbow\\\" has a work of art so subversively exploited the conventions of the movie musical as South Park. From the droll opening strains of Mountain Town, to the Disneyesque \\\"Up There,\\\" to the Les Miserables spoof, \\\"La Resistance,\\\" South Park simultaneously sends up the genre while paying homage to it, and still finds room to use the songs to score delicious points against its myriad targets.  One last thing: this movie is not cynical. Beneath the scatological humor, the cartoon violence, the scathing portrayals of Wynona Ryder et al, and the backdrop of adult xenophobia, sexual repression and political opportunism, is a sensibility that exalts childhood as an island of honesty and idealism, if also of id-like impulse and frequent selfishness. In this they share space on the shelf of great satires with \\\"Candide,\\\" \\\"Gulliver's Travels,\\\" \\\"Tom Sawyer\\\" and especially \\\"Huckleberry Finn\\\"--classics that, like BL&U, also exposed the hypocrisies of the adult world \\\"through the eyes of a child.\\\"  Elvis Costello once sang, \\\"I want to bite the hand that feeds me/I want to bite that hand so badly/I want to make them wish they'd never met me.\\\" That BLU was shut out at the Academy Awards (having only garnered a nomination for the relatively tame \\\"Blame Canada\\\", which lost, appropriately enough, to the execrable Phil Collins) only vindicates the film's take-no-prisoners send-up of nearly everything that annoys in this suffociatingly focus-group-tested, PC-policed, cynically sentimental, violence-ridden, love-starved modern world. See this movie, and see the persistence of hope and possibility sparkling like a diamond amid the pop culture detritus of a quiet little red-necked, white-trash, strait-laced, mesuggeneh, US mountain town.\", \"When you have the reputation that Parker and Stone do, it is hard to get rid of the sterotypes that have been drawn around you. You are forever stuck in the mold that has been bestowed upon you. But perhaps sometimes when stigmas of that nature are forever embedded with your name and reputation, it actually gives them more leeway to make a statement that is political in nature. As long as they disguise that statement(s) with all that made them popular in the first place, they can get away with it. So now, if I said that beyond the non-stop vulgarity and infinite humour that this film contains, is a film that has an important message camouflaged in animation, would you believe me? Would you care?  First off, this is the most profanity laced film I have ever seen in my life, and that includes early Eddie Murphy efforts. But the profanity in this film had me in stitches. Honestly, that was almost not just a figure of speech either. I laughed so hard that I almost banged my head on the on the person in front of me. Remember how absorbed you were at the horror of war at the beginning of Private Ryan? Well if you had to parallel the two and replace horror with humour, that is a safe comparison. This film is so ******* funny and I really enjoyed it on that level. I can honestly say that I haven't laughed so hard since Office Space. The profanity goes a bit overboard at times but I think that was on purpose. Some of the humour is a bit gross ( seeing Sadam's rubber propalactic was funny but a little sick at the same time ) but I think these guys wanted to see how far they could go. And they went very far and they dared the MPAA to censor them even more, and hey, I was very entertained.  But on the political side, there are a lot of dicey issues that are covered here. Censorship for one. It's funny because we as Canadians and Americans have some of the same ideologies and one of them is free speech. But if that is what we want, then we have to be willing to go all the way. You can't pick and choose what is more free and more appropriate than something else just because it is not politically correct. Free speech means free speech. Free to express your thoughts in an open forum. This film tells us that free speech is free as long as you don't offend the masses. It also says that in MPAA's world it is okay to see blood and guts and intestines and brain tissue ( many of those films get an AA rating ) but profanity dictates that an R or an X is required to see the film. That really is silly.  The film also touches on racism in the armed forces and it shows how brain washed Americans get when there is a conflict with an opposing nation. It doesn't matter that perhaps some of the issues at hand are clouded and misunderstood, many people stand behind their government to the very end. Kill em' all in the name of the Constitution. There are also some stabs at religion and being gay and a plethora of other issues. A particular scene with Bill Gates is funny.  Parker and Stone have given the finger to the ratings system in America and I think people will like it. They have also given much more credit to the Canadian armed forces in this movie. If the U.S. ever went to war with us, it would probably be over in a day or so. So thanks for making us look at least competetive. That was cool.  It may be weird to read a review of this film and have comments about politics in here, because it really is a funny movie and I was in a good mood when I left the theater, but there is more to this movie than just humour. To accomplish that and still be known as the guys who made fart jokes and the F word popular is quite a feat. This film is there to enjoy but it is also there to ask some tough and interesting questions. Enjoy the film, but listen to what it has to say. That is, besides the F and S word, listen to what it wants to say.  **** One last observation and that is, when I was in line for the film, a lady and her five year old daughter were in front of me. When they asked for South Park, the cashier asked if she was sure because there is a lot of profanity in the film. The lady reassured her that it was fine. Her daughter can listen and watch but knows not to repeat. That is responsible parenting. Teach your kids right from wrong and hope they turn out well. That's all you can do. And I applaud that parent for doing so. She may never know who I am but I will remember her for quite some time. Maybe if more people were like that, there wouldn't be such a fuss about profanity. After all, they are just words.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Spacejacked\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0120174\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Spare Me\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0108200\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Sphere\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0120184\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0076759\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Starship Troopers\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0120201\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0079945\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"State and Main\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0120202\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Stepmom\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0120686\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Storytelling\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0250081\", \"total_review_count\": 30, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"Another abortive, pitiful attempt from Solondz... His problem is that subjects of his films are not interesting at all. You just don't care for them.

It is a critical look at political correctness, and a highly comedic one, although most people are probably too offended to see that. I can say from experience that the first segment of the film, \\\"Fiction\\\", is a rather accurate view of a college creative writing class. And the second segment, \\\"Nonfiction\\\", has one of the creepiest characters ever in the young kid in the family. With this film you either get it or you don't, and the majority don't seem to get it. I can't say with time this film will be looked back on any more favorably, although it deserves it. If anything it will probably be even more offensive. Solondz' comedy works for me, because it is not forced, although his punchlines are more like social commentary. Like Spike Lee's greatest films, this is one that is bound to make a lot of people angry. And like Spike Lee's films, it also has several points to make.\", \"With a forgettable plot, painful dialog and non-existent directing, this is a waste of film.  The first story \\\"fiction\\\" is by far the worst of the two. Dialog is delivered with pauses after nearly every line as if they just spoke some profound words that will be remembered for the ages. All it really shows is the director's lack of purpose. It's as if he's trying to be avant-guard or biting but all he ends up doing is looking ridiculous.  The second story \\\"non-fiction\\\" is not as painful but still is a joke. None of the characters are even remotely believable and just come across as poor imitations of clich\\u00e9's that aren't valid anymore.   If this was a first time director then I would expect this type of result....but it isn't. All it shows is the director's shot at trying to recapture his initial creative success and missing.....badly.\", \"It should almost be mandatory for any Hollywood director to view a film of Todd Solondz before beginning a new project. No director at present can present the honesty that he presented in \\\"Happiness\\\" or the newer \\\"Storytelling\\\". His work, along with Larry Clark's \\\"Kids\\\" are what's missing in Hollywood movies. They don't require million dollar budgets for special effects or name stars demanding twenty million per picture. You start with a genuine script and a bunch of actors who know what they're doing and how to take direction and a cameraman who knows how to show the viewer what needs to be seen. That's the formula. The finished product is a little masterpiece such as \\\"Storytelling\\\". This movie, especially part two, will knock your socks off!\", \"this movie is a burning attack on the hollowness of many modern American values, particularly for young people trying to find their way through high school and early adulthood. i doubt Al Qeda (sp?) could make a more blasting propaganda film than this about American values. but the problem with this movie is that it never lets its characters be human, it chooses just to show the darkest, most empty portrait possible. this movie will find an audience with people who are so postmodern as to be no longer capable of real feelings or tenderness. any sensitivity is something merely to mock. it will also find an audience with people who would rather savage than understand other people, pre-judging them to something like Sartre's No Exit or a Neil Labutte (sp?) movie. this is only truth as much as the view of an asshole taking a crap is \\\"truth\\\", but there is a whole lot more to human beings than the cold, narrow characters we see here. Solondz characters are all losers or players, when really we are all a little of both and not so much of either. perhaps the harsher reality is that our lives are actually simpler than this, less evil, less harsh, less sad. perhaps Solondz wants to demonize life when life is more of a purgatory than a hell. but either way, you won't see the kinder, more humane moments of life in this movie, and for that, it is a rather sad, simple, pathetic kind of story. not because of the characters, because of the storyteller.\", \"wow what a comedy. this movie is pretty compelling and it gets pretty dark, my god the only grudge i hold against it is that it's too short, there should have been 3 segments but then again what the hell am i talking about this movie is so pure evil, but in a good way.\", \"Part 1 - A young aspiring writer with a cerebral palsied writer boyfriend both attend writing class taught by a seething, viciously critical novelist.  Part 2 - A schlubby wannabe documentary filmmaker finds his perfect subject: an abjectly apathetic teenager living in privilege with his volcanic father, dithering mother, jock brother and supremely smug, tactless baby brother.  There's nothing in movies more frustrating to me than when a director/writer finds fertile soil and only digs two inches deep. They're precocious enough to stumble upon a great subject but they're content(or shamed or frightened into) going on autopilot from there, lazily applying whatever moldy stylistic preconceptions they made their name with, their auteristic \\\"trademarks\\\", if you will(in director Todd Solondz' case, it's awkwardness, embarrassment, and pain heaped upon pain). I don't have a problem with Solondz' unpleasant modus operandi so the self conscious apologias and justifications found here are superfluous for me - what I wanted out of the film is a deeper examination of the themes of race, fetishistic exploitation, and lack of compassion Solondz is so quick to point out but not address to my satisfaction. His indictments of other films(American Beauty, American Movie, whose resident burnout Mike Schenk gets a cameo here) are impassioned but unconvincing. On the whole though, I think I mainly had a problem with what's not here. Truth is, there was great acting all around, and it was suitably provocative.\", \"by Dane Youssef  The writer/director of this one is Todd Solondz, so you all know what to expect. For those who saw his heavily acclaimed (by critics and audiences alike) \\\"Welcome To The Dollhouse\\\" a movie about the hell almighty on earth that is junior high school.  I was not one of the film's many admirers. Yes, I felt like just about everybody else that the film did have some poignant truths, but... I pretty much already knew them all. It all felt kinda redundant. I was in high school at the time and every scene I was watching, I thought, \\\"Yeah, no sh*t.\\\"  I mean, I know it's supposed to be a satire, but I felt too much like I was watching what I already knew and thought and what has been said too many times before. Solondz was preaching to the reverend there.  His next film, \\\"Happiness\\\" about three sisters and their lives... and how adulthood is even less as mentally unbalanced as junior high school. About three sisters and how their lives aren't as well-adjusted as they seem. The seemingly ideal perfect sister is dry, secretly dull and lives such a sterile life that when an obscene phone caller calls her... she starts stalking him.  The best line in the movie \\\"Happiness\\\"... that almost encapsulates the entire film:  \\\"I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing with you.\\\" \\\"But I'm not laughing.\\\"  The film is about two different forms of storytelling: \\\"Fiction\\\" and \\\"Non-Fiction.\\\"  In the first story, \\\"Fiction,\\\" Solondz shines an interpretive light a creative writing class.  A woman with writing aspirations and her cerebral-palsy boyfriend with the same. Vi has broken up with her boyfriend after his obviously autobiographical story is panned horribly by the school teacher who scathes it. He especially takes some kind of pleasure in attacking the title: \\\"The Rawness of Truth.\\\"   Vi's boyfriend is furious with her for not giving it to him straight. Marcus' \\\"Rawness\\\" is about how Vi gave him confidence and made him feel... \\\"completely cerebral.\\\"  Most of the whole class warms up to it... except for the teacher's pet... and the writing teacher himself, a Pulitzer-winner author of a novel entitled, \\\"A Sunday Lynching.\\\"  Vi, stricken, gets hammered, lights up and... well... let me just put it this way... after having her last story ripped to shreds by the professor, her next story is certainly something of an improvement. And she's definitely evolving... because he's finally got something to say.  The professor has a poetic line about the writing process that rings incredibly true: \\\"Whenever you write... it all becomes fiction.\\\"  \\\"Non-Fiction\\\" skewers reality and human experiences with life with a scalpel. Often at times, those documentarians seem to be roasting and attacking their subjects with great anger and fury... but are they just trying to get heat for their film... or is that how they really see it?  Who knows? Many artists are former victims, grown children with bad experiences and hell-bent on vengeance. \\\"Non-Fiction\\\" revolves around the exploits of a documentation filmmaker and his desire to make a documentary about teenagers and what they're feeling now.  Have things changed much? Drugs... suicidal feelings... self-loathing... loathing of the world around them... of the way society treats them, pressures them, conforms them and disposes of them... how do teenagers put up with it? What's ahead? Mark Webber is Scooby Livingston, a depressed, moody teenager who's completely lost and like many teenagers, his all-purpose requests to every questing is \\\"I don't know,\\\" \\\"I really don't care\\\" and \\\"Whatever.\\\"   He always seems deep in thought and in need of answers. He has big goal aspirations... but no idea whatsoever as how to attain them. When asked how he plans to attain his dreams of stardom, he answers: \\\"I don't know, see if I have any connections... whatever...\\\" After a meet-strange with a documentian Toby, both seem to be exactly what they're looking for and maybe their seemingly unobtainable dreams might have a chance of coming true after all.  The family is not enthusiastic about the whole thing... especially the father who doesn't want the family's dirty laundry to be aired out. But after some hard questions and earnest promises, he agrees.  No family wants to be exploited... and this family certainly would provide more than enough of such material. I think the boy represents Solondz as a young teenager (Solondz himself is a vegetarian) and of course, Giamatti as Toby is Solondz as a filmmaker (Solondz dresses up Giamatti to look exactly like him). There's pressure all around from every angle and sadly, no way out in sight. College doesn't sound appealing to Scoob. Will there be a place for him. Since Scooby grew up to be Solondz himself, there must be hope. But I think Scooby represents all teenagers. He reflects our generation. God, how many teens are there out there EXACTLY like Scooby?  Like all of his other efforts, this is about how ugliness and unsettling rage lives in middle class suburbia. You can't watch this movie, see/hear some of these people and not think of someone you know or have met or seen randomly on the street. Solondz is from Suburbia, New Jersey and is talking about what's going on there. I like how he talks about things that most people shy away from. He wants to criticize, satirize and get you to ask yourself... \\\"How many people are really like this? And... is there hope for us? How many of these people exist... and more importantly, are they in our neighborhood? Not many... hopefully.\\\"  Like all of Solondz films, people will either be mesmerized by it or despise it, but it's a movie that many should see. Perhaps a movie for cynical teenagers and aspiring storytellers. Just know what you're getting into. Like all of Solondz's pictures, this cuts deep... and leaves a mark.\", \"Storytelling is an indictment of repressive suburbia, but it is also an indictment of the postmodern, ironic, and politically correct intellectuals, and how both parts of society control and restrict people from being truly who they are. It is also about, well, storytelling and how easily stories and plots are manipulated for effect.  The first half hour, \\\"Fiction,\\\" is devoted to a story of a college student, Vi, who is tired of \\\"dating the undergraduates\\\" and ends up a violent and racially charged sex scene with her African American creative writing professor. Solondz pushes the limit on all of the society's buttons in \\\"Fiction,\\\" from the handicapped to race relations to sexual politics, and it is almost like he was simply out to shock the audience. The short film comes across as even trite and cliched, although now I realize that I'm quoting a scene from it almost directly, so perhaps this is Solondz's point. Still, if you ever seen any other of Solondz's movies, you can see the whole point of this section coming from a mile away (the dangers of political correctness, the prudishness and hypocrisy of the American middle class, even those claiming to be liberal or progressive, etc.) And I just couldn't believe that Vi would only say \\\"Don't be racist, don't be racist\\\" in the bathroom scene. I think \\\"I gotta get the hell outta here\\\" would be much more logical.  However, the brilliant last hour, \\\"Nonfiction,\\\" more than makes up for the first half. It tells the story of a listless and intelligent teenager who lives with an angry and sad family in suburban New Jersey, and also about the documentary that is being made about them. Truly, I wish this were the whole movie, it is that good. Yes, there's plenty of postmodern film-within-the-film winking, but that quickly falls apart as we reach the heartbreaking and disturbing ending, when the movie suddenly becomes painfully real. What is also funny about \\\"Nonfiction,\\\" which is supposed to be \\\"real,\\\" is that it contains completely fictional and even forced plot points: someone is injured and slips into a coma, someone else is hypnotized and told what to do, and even the final, terrible act seems more to come out of a bad TV movie than real life. (I also especially enjoyed the not-so-subtle digs at American Beauty and American Movie.)  Do we want our lives to be more like an episode of \\\"Friends,\\\" wrapped up neat and tidy, with minor quibbles that are resolved in a half hour (or, during sweeps, maybe a \\\"two-part special\\\")? Is political correctness just a big cover up for uncomfortable yet still very real desires and thoughts? Which is worse: being told what to do, or being told what to think? Are the two the same thing? Storytelling does address these questions, and I think if \\\"Nonfiction\\\" were stretched to feature-length, it would answer them brilliantly. But, because of the ho-hum first hour (yes, ho-hum, even with \\\"that scene\\\" and all), all the pieces don't quite fall together. To change the lyrics of a certain Scottish band, \\\"It could've been a brilliant movie.\\\"   Storytelling is worth seeing for the great acting (in both \\\"Fiction\\\" and \\\"Nonfiction\\\") and the excellent second section, but you can clip your toenails or stare out the window for the most part during the first half hour. I was expecting more of a cynical irony-fest as in Happiness, but I was truly touched by \\\"Nonfiction,\\\" and it will stay with me for quite awhile.\", \"Todd Solondz seems to specialise in hating everybody. From \\\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\\\", through \\\"Happiness\\\" to this film, he seems to thrive in misanthropy, delving into the worst aspects of human nature.  \\\"Storytelling\\\" has two separate segments: \\\"Fiction\\\" deals with a college student (Selma Blair) who breaks up with her disabled boyfriend and has a brutal one-night stand with her creative writing professor. \\\"Non-Fiction\\\" describes the attempt of an aspiring documentarian (the always good Paul Giamatti) to make a film about a typical high-school loser and his wealthy family.  As always the film is savage and bitter and is bound to have something to offend almost anyone, and yet it is very funny. In a way the laughs are almost shocked out of you by the casual cruelty on display. In my opinion \\\"Storytelling\\\" is better than the over-rated \\\"Happiness\\\" (which just went too far at times).  When you want something to make you feel good about life and humanity, don't watch this film.\", \"This movie is great.Because it deals with nasty subjects and themes that are just too real and raw for most directors out there to even attempt to handle.Tod is a truly consummated director and storyteller(pun intended).I certainly can see an autobiographic commentary here, as any viewer paying some attention could.But for all it's dead pan humor and dark views of the human nature, this movie is a lot of fun and full of twisted, brilliant moments.*Spoilers Next*For example: when the character Scobby is high on marijuana and sees himself as a guest on Conan Doyle's Show...great!! And when his little brother(highly annoying and egotistic but also very intelligent)hypnotize his father to..love him!*End of Spoilers* By any means you should compare this with Tod's masterpiece: Happiness, but with Welcome To The Doll House(another excellent movie of his)this could stand very tall and proud.Highly recommended essential look!\", \"Storytelling is a great movie, at times Solondz could have done better but everything was good. From the music, that was the main reason why i wanted to watch the trailer again; to the humor. This movie dares to go places that other movies don't and most of the time it works.  Two stories, fiction and fact, make up this story. The first one, fiction, involves an interracial relationship between a student and her college professor. The second, Fact, revolves around a boy named Scooby and his \\\"struggles\\\". The second story is where all the meat is and the first was pretty good too.  John Goodman gave a good performance and the lad that played Scooby was pretty good too. All in all this movie deserves a watching, but i warn you this movie is not for people that like \\\"crossroads\\\" or Hilary Duff movies. If you enjoy music and indie movies this is for you.\", \"I loved Happiness and Welcome to the Dollhouse, so I looked forward to this movie with great anticipation. My hopes were dashed, however. Here we have two unrelated stories with relatively boring characters, neither of which is allowed to fully develop. Both had potential in their own right, but they just seem to go nowhere. I desperately wanted to like the movie. I gave it every chance to impress me. But the \\\"shocking\\\" stuff, like the racial issues in \\\"Fiction\\\", wasn't really that shocking, yet it came across as being more done for shock value than the well-defined, nuanced characters of the much more shocking Happiness.\", \"I have seen this movie twice now, and I'm wondering what is up with that large orange block in the first story? Is there something real going on here? The movie as a whole seemed like a cross between American Rose and Six Feet Under. Selma Blair seems to have an affinity with quirky indie type films. The moment when Vi walks into the restroom to freshen up, and discovers the dozens of photographs of other girls, some who i believe are in Vi's class, who ended up in the same predicament was a nice touch to a kind of dry film. Teacher/Student fantasies happen in real life every day. Who hasn't wondered about sex with a teacher, it goes as far back as grade school.\", \"The best thing about Solondz's films is that they're utterly unpredictable. You never know what to expect, hence along with the steady stream of very funny gags and situations, there is a certain tension, almost like watching a \\\"comedy thriller\\\". (A new genre perhaps?) Solondz veers away from the clich\\u00e9s of both mainstream Hollywood rubbish and lethargic/pretentious/mindless indie crap, hence keeps the viewer on his toes for the duration. In a sense, he is the \\\"anti-Ephron\\\". A deaf-and-blind person could foretell you how a Nora comedy proceeds - in every successive scene - in her terrible noraphronic cinematic turds.  I'm not quite sure what Solond'z political leanings are. Chances are that he is yet another movie-making liberal (hint hint: he's a vegetarian, and his films are about middle-class suburbia), but he isn't a black-and-white, narrow-minded, dogmatic liberal who never analyzes anything, never digs below the surface, simply sponging in everything Michael Moore tells him - i.e. the stereotypical intellectually catatonic Leftist: lazy, smug, gullible, unable to learn. His cynicism regarding humanity isn't misanthropic, he simply tells is like it is (more-or-less).  Besides, what's so bad about misanthropy? Marxism might seem (I underline \\\"might\\\") people-friendly on the surface, but deep down it hates every man, woman, and child. And because a skeptical view of man's alleged \\\"inherent goodness\\\" is the foundation of all Marxist/Leftist beliefs, eventually Solondz might actually connect the dots and realize finally that left-wing ideology has no scientific basis, no roots in logic whatsoever. He'll come around... if he isn't afraid to face the consequences of \\\"switching sides\\\". Of course, a problem is that most Americans only see two (extreme) sides they can join: either that of the Socialist, clueless, overly idealistic liberal whiner, or the side of the Christian fundamentalist wacko who considers abortion the burning issue of this millennium. There IS a middle road, you know... (well, a middle road that tilts toward the Right - naturally.)   \\\"Storytelling\\\" has two parts, and while both are very good, it is somewhat of a pity that the first story was so brief. I got a great kick out of those English Lit class discussions, with all those hypocritical, cowardly, unimaginative, brainwashed college girls listening to the second essay, but pretending awkwardly not to know what or whom it's really about. It was extremely funny; these characters alone have the potential for a mini-series, let alone a 90 minute full-length film. However, these exploits end after a mere 10-15 minutes, to be followed by an entertaining saga of a Jewish family, their mentally unstable Putzfrau, and a nerdy, confused filmmaker wannabe. Great dialogue.  One of the highlights is certainly the youngest Goodman son telling Consuela that the execution of her murdering/raping grandson was \\\"possibly for the best\\\".\", \"How could you do a better movie about storytelling than showing how hard it is! Solondz splits the movie in two parts, \\\"Fiction\\\" and \\\"Non-fiction\\\" and shows in both how easily our subjective perception of real life loses its grips in other people's perceptions, situations, expectations... while writing about it. Whoever has ever written something: Don't miss this film!\", \"This was a great film, superbly crafted. The two stories were not given equal time in the film, as they should not have. Although Selma Blair delivers, what I believe to be, her best performance to date, her \\\"story\\\" pales in comparison to the \\\"Nonfiction\\\" part of the movie, which gives a much more real and brutal account of Mark Webbers character, Scooby.  I would rather not give a plot summary nor deliberate on inconsequential details of the movie, but suffice to say this is a must see! While it may not be as eloquent as American Beauty, Storytelling provides a wonderful snapshot into the psyche of high school and college life wrapped in some extraordinary circumstances. This film is a testament to despair, self loathing and personal struggle.  The ending is, perhaps, the crown jewel of this film. It made my jaw drop and, in fact, I sat in front of the TV for a number of minutes before I regained my senses. Side note: I had to watch \\\"Fiction\\\" twice, as I failed to see its correlation to \\\"Nonfiction\\\" when I watched it the first time.  My vote: 8 out of 10\", \"I saw this film today in high school, at cinema class. tough my class is usually in a very high level of film understanding, I was surprised to see how pepole \\\"didn't like the ending\\\" and \\\"tought the film could have used situations to make scenes more emotional\\\", missing all the point of this movie.  from my point of view, this film is about emotional disawarness to other pepole's feelings. it is screamed in the relationships inside the family, between the director and Scooby, and in every scene in the script. I do not want to make spoilers for the movie, but I think it shows clear at the last line of the movie.  \\\"storytelling\\\" takes what so many other movies (like \\\"crash\\\") tried to do, but do it better, with more depth, more meaning, more gentle treatment to the characters, just better. who ever saw it and did not think of the point of characters that are emotionally closed, I think should watch the movie again, because he might miss a spectacular work of cinema.\", \"the soundtrack for this movie was done entirely by Belle & Sebastian, but most of the songs recorded by them aren't in the movie. their full soundtrack is released as an amazing album.  that soundtrack is better than the movie itself in many ways, since the moral statement of the film, about the power of art to distort reality gets lost in the spectacle of the movie. the unsuccessful film screening is a perfect summary of the whole film. not to say i didn't like this movie, i do. i just think that it has a muddled point and muddled execution, which is an interesting commentary on the ability to control your art and say a good moral message: life and art get messy and a real moral tale is hard to tell realistically.\", \"The movie consists of two different parts - two different approaches to the storytelling. The mutual thread - what people are capable of doing in the search of the inspiration... Not to mention the main character's alienation, which is a leitmotif in all Solondz's works. Even though people tend to criticise the first, short part, it is quite interesting. I think that the key to that part is the teacher's comment on Marcus story, \\\"The Wrongness of Truth\\\": \\\"is that supposed to be a joke of some sort\\u0085or are you just being pretentious?\\\" Quite a gimmick\\u0085 The second part - well, it's just a masterpiece. Makes you feel depressed and amused at the same time. Truly admire Solondz's work\", \"Another completely original, dark, deeply skewered and audacious commentary on society from Todd S., whom we've come to depend upon for this sort of thing. Not as focused as Dollhouse or as filled-out as Happiness, Storytelling does seem sparse, and that's one of the things I like best about it (I've seen it 4 times now)- how T.S. didn't feel the need to conform to what the majority of film goers (even his OWN crowd!) expect when they enter a theatre.   It's divided into two parts - Fiction, with its heavy sexual, presumably-racist and ironic elements, a searing affair that many people seem to have found offensive without getting the underlying satire, and then there's Non-Fiction; amazing how much spot-on societal jabs T. S. squeezes into this one, and plus it has another great, multi-layered performance from Paul Giamatti, always a major selling point of any film, for me.  The bottom line: I believe T.S. deserves credit for his audacity alone, his unwillingness to compromise his vision, however unacceptable it might be. Or he might be consciously tailoring his vision toward the unacceptable, sort of like Andy Kaufman did - getting off on just making people react, shaking them out of indifference. Or maybe, like some people have suggested, he's run out of ideas (or he peaked with Dollhouse) and he's just rehashing the same stuff, hoping nobody will notice. Or maybe he WANTS us to notice, maybe it's a cry for help, in which case I would recommend a writing class, but NOT one that has Robert Wisdom as the professor.\", \"Yet another masterpiece from one of the great indie filmmakers. Solondz again uses a lot of his trademark stark and unsettling characters to tell two separate stories. \\\"Fiction\\\" was short and to the point, the message being the utter subjectiveness of the art of storytelling. It was hilarious how the other kids in the writing class reacted to Vi's story, like it was improbable, racist and offensive. Solondz again displayed in this story that many people ARE racist and offensive, sometimes without even realizing it. It would have been impossible to make a whole movie out of \\\"Fiction,\\\" and I think it was impressive that Solondz had the daring to just change over to another story without trying to link them, which would have been tedious. Solondz wanted to make two separate points, and the only way to do so was with two separate stories. The graphic sex scene between Selma Blair and Robert Wisdom is blocked out in the R-rated version; Solondz has a big red rectangle over the characters in a successful attempt to show how the MPAA censors can ruin a movie with their silly rules. I actually thought it added to the message of the first story, and the uncensored version is also on the DVD anyway. The second story is much longer and as a result has characters that are much more well developed. The Paul Giamatti character was a hilarious reflection of Solondz himself. Not just physically, but also in the way he was criticized for making fun of the characters in his documentary just as Solondz has been criticized for doing the same in \\\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\\\" and \\\"Happiness.\\\" Many people who dislike Solondz films just can't stand the often vicious or disturbing denizens that inhabit his works. These people should stick to watching \\\"Titanic\\\" and \\\"A Walk to Remember\\\" as they have no appreciation for the daring and honest way Solondz makes his movies.\", \"At first viewing I though this was the weakest of director Todd Solondz films, however like all of his works, it's impossible to forget once seen. Todd Solondze absorbed criticisms about exploitation, showing misery for misery's sake, and just generally being a \\\"meanie\\\", and turned them into the cinematic equivalent of a \\\"dis song\\\"(rap term for song made specifically as an attack or \\\"beef\\\" with another rapper), with Solondz against critics, carefully trying to explain the notions of \\\"Storytelling\\\". Our first story deals with sex, political correctness, race, and fiction writing, as a young liberal college girl has unpleasant and ironic sexual experience with her Black writing professor. Our second well...with the same subjects just this time with non-fiction in place of fiction. Here Solondz shows us yet another dysfunctional upper middle class Jewish family in chaos, but this time as a \\\"documentary\\\", which shows us the pathetic film maker, the cruel or otherwise ignorant family, and the audience who laughs and scoffs, at it all.   This is a rare film, because it's a film maker addressing his critiques, himself, and his audience all at once. And it has plenty of Solondz trade mark cringe scenes, that veer drastically from comic to dramatic in a matter of breaths. The results are absorbing but like all Solondz it leaves a bad taste in your mouth, and makes you honestly question your own moral compass. They say satire is dead if the audience cannot be shocked, but it's also dead if the audience cannot be shamed, in the days where South Park and Family Guy, are on non cable TV any afternoon (l love both shows), shock and shame are concepts so familiar they've lost some of their power. Thankfully just when we've seen it all and were sure that nothing matters and nothing can surprise, startle, or offend us, Todd Solondz will be there to show things can always get worse.\", \"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* All in all, this film was hard to watch at times. I knew going into it that it was going to be a somewhat disturbing experience. It is Solondz after all. However, when you compare it to his previous films, \\\"Happiness\\\" and \\\"Palindromes\\\", it seems like Sesame Street in comparison.  The film is split up into two parts: \\\"Fiction\\\" and \\\"Non-fiction\\\". The first story deals with a young lady who has enrolled in a writing class with her handicapped boyfriend. Her teacher is an overbearing and brutally honest black man. It is apparent that there is some sexual tension between the two of them. She dumps her boyfriend, goes to a bar one night, and her professor just so happens to be there. She ends up back at his place, and something horrible happens to her that pretty much ruins her emotionally. She writes a fictional short story based upon what happened to her that night Everyone in class accuses her of exploitation, of being a racist, etc. Her only response to the harsh criticism: \\\"But it really happened!\\\" Powerful stuff...  The second half of the film deals with a documentary filmmaker who is basically supposed to represent Solondz himself. He wants to make a film about teenagers living in modern day suburbia, and he chooses a slacker named Scooby to be his subject. Scooby comes from an extremely dysfunctional family, headed by his extremely temperamental father. Scooby doesn't know what he wants out of life, doesn't even care to take the SATs at school, and wants to be a talk show host when he grows up. He has two brothers. One is your typical high school jock, and he thinks that Scooby is gay. His younger brother is a demonic little intellectual brat who is continually harassing the maid, and on occasion, hypnotizes his parents to get what he wants. However, the documentary filmmaker insists that he cares about these people and decides to go on with his project. There are moments here where it is clear that Solondz is making a statement about past criticisms of his films. Anyone who has done any research on the director will pick up on this. Scooby pours his heart out in front of the camera, telling of his hopes and dreams. He ends up taking the SAT, albeit in a very unconventional way. All the while, the filmmakers intentions become less and less honorable. I will stop there for fear of giving away the shocking ending.  Solondz may be letting off a little steam here, and some of it feels gratuitous. However, it gives you plenty of food for thought, and you won't be able to think about anything else for a while.\", \"Now from reading the trivia provided by IMDb, it can be learned that their was originally going to be three stories. After learning this, I can somewhat understand the format of movie the director was going for. However, having only two stories (which are disproportionate in the amount of time spent on them) is completely distracting because you find yourself looking for the parallel between them. The theme was their but that wasn't enough. If Solandz would have just pulled one character from the first story and show a glimpse of them in the second, I would have found the movie a lot smoother around the edges. Since he did not do this, I am forced to evaluate the second part of the film more due to the time spent on it as well as plot development.  Format aside, I loved the second part of storytelling. All characters are lovable and easy to relate to, especially Scooby. Scooby represents a normal teenager trying to find his own with many confrontations with his parents. So much so, that he can almost be looked at as a theme more than as a character. The portrayal of the oldest, middle, and youngest child is dead on. Parents are a clich\\u00e9 but it only adds to the plot. *SOMEWHAT SPOILER* The beginning shot of the director makes you sympathize him which then leads you to trust his intentions. Everyone, even the viewer, is betrayed by his depiction of the family. The movie ended perfectly, as there was nothing else that could be said or done and I give props to Solandz for being able to leave it perfect and raw.\", \"Storytelling has two parts. Fiction and non fiction. In fiction Tod Solondz tells us how we have to watch part two, as soon as you start writing (filming in this case) everything becomes fiction. It is not surprising that the first part (fiction) seems to be more non-fiction than part 2 (non-fiction). The first part is the very raw and painful story about a young girl who is raped by her literature teacher. The second part is the story of a documentaire filmmaker who tries to make a film about teens in suburbia. The guy is a looser, and nobody believes his film will be succesful. But the family he follows (by accident) gets involved in a serie of dramatic events, and the film becomes a hit. When the filmmaker tells his subject he is sory for what happend to him, scooby tells him not to be sorry, because his film is a hit.  Tod Solondz is a genial storyteller. He doesn't follow the normal structure of a hollywood film, a protagonist with an dramatic purpose, an antagonsist with an invert purpose, ... Like the bad guy in part one tells us, the second story is way better, this one has at least a begin, a middle and an end. In fact Non-fiction has a begin, a middle and an end, but that is not the reason why you will like the movie. The dramatic events that will happen to the family livingstone are not the motor that makes this movie turn. As in happiness, it is the way Tod Solondz shows us how we really act in life, different than how we think we are acting. watching a Tod solondz movie is like when you watch yourself in the mirror early in the morning when you aren't completely awake. there is an ocean between where i live, an where tod Solondz films his movies, but everytime again, i see myself reflected in the personages of Tod Solondz. That is wath makes his films so wonderful painful, you see people doing stupid things, but you can't blame them, because you know you should do the same thing. You love the personages you are laughing with.  Well, i love Tod Solondz, in my directors all-time ranking i'll put him on the same level as lars Von Trier, just under Ingmar Bergman, and igmar bergman, that is the top.\", \"It's pretty rare when I am at a loss for words, particularly when I am weighing an opinion on a film. Even more rare is when I'm speechless about a film by a favorite filmmaker. And to further the irony, the film is titled \\\"Storytelling\\\". Written and directed by Todd Solondz (\\\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\\\", \\\"Happiness\\\"), \\\"Storytelling\\\" is actually two short stories within the same film.  Being a fan of Solondz's work, I can't possibly pretend to be surprised that \\\"Storytelling\\\" is depressing. Anyone who has seen his other work knows what he or she is in for going in. One thing that I felt about \\\"Storytelling\\\" more than any of the other two Solondz films I've seen is that it seemed a lot more personal. The character of Toby is clearly a representation of Solondz, and a depiction and answer to and of his critics who say that he is a horrible person for \\\"mocking\\\" his characters, etc. In the film, when a fellow filmmaker criticizes Toby, telling him it is \\\"glib and facile to make fun of those people\\\", Toby denies this, simply saying \\\"I love them.\\\" Looking back on his past work, and looking back on reviews I have written of those films, there is a definite pattern with the characterizations and the situations that Solondz writes them into. The situations are painful and the characters are sympathetic (or pathetic, depending on how you look at them), but the pain comes from Solondz not turning the camera away from the subject when they are at their most vulnerable. Most filmmakers, in order to make a more commercially acceptable film do not inject the kind of honesty that Solondz does, which naturally ends up creating criticism for him because it is \\\"different\\\".  Also notable is his defiant decision to, rather than cut his film according to MPAA standards to give it an R rating instead of NC-17, create a ridiculously large red box to mask the sex scene in \\\"Fiction\\\". Apparently he was told that the scene either needed to be cut or he would get a higher rating, (an absolutely ridiculous notion because the action itself was not overly graphic, it was the details of the scene that were disturbing) so in his refusal to cut it, he decided to throw it back in the MPAA's face and call it what it was: Censorship.  Out of many \\\"disturbing\\\" scenes, there was one scene that I found so profound that it has not left my mind since I watched this film last night. Scooby decides that he wants to see the footage that Toby has shot thus far, so he travels into New York City to see him. Mike, who tells him that Toby is actually screening the footage elsewhere as they speak, greets him at the door. When Scooby gets to the screening, where various intelligista are gathered, he sees himself on the screen, giving his inner thoughts, while the audience is laughing. Other than to turn to the footage on the screen, the camera does not leave Scooby's face, which has been transformed from a look of hopefulness to a mask of grief. Later, when he returns home to an unexpected tragedy at home, among the various policemen, etc., Toby runs up to Scooby with Mike, camera in tow, saying, \\\"Oh my god, Scooby. I'm so, so sorry.\\\" To which Scooby, providing the last line of the film says, looking right into the camera, \\\"Don't be. Your movie's a hit.\\\" That scene, those words, and the rest of the film made \\\"Storytelling\\\" shockingly and almost unbearably good. Solondz, who has made a career out of turning his eye to the fraying suburban ideal, is at his bleakest with this film. I've read criticism that he is \\\"too\\\" dark, which make his films somewhat unwatchable; a notion I find absolutely ridiculous. True, his films are like repeatedly ripping scabs off of a wound, never allowing it to heal, but their profundity is almost tangible. \\\"Storytelling\\\" was so thought provoking and effective that I found myself too numb to fully react until I actually began to put my thoughts into words, at which point I felt like I wanted to cry my eyes out. In a society where films like \\\"Guess Who\\\" and \\\"Miss Congeniality\\\" rule the box office, I find this to be a really difficult film to universally recommend, but there are definitely those out there who will appreciate this film. An extremely strong 8/10.  --Shelly\", \"After reading about Palindromes and finding myself oddly attracted to the subject matter of several of Todd Solondz's features, I bought this film. It would seem that it has a reputation as being his worst work to date(at least as far as theatrically released movies go)... I must say, if the rest of what he's done is this powerful, I will have to keep my eyes open for it. You seldom see movies that are this unpleasant. There are films that are far, far harder to watch... but this is still not one you put on to enjoy yourself. As many other viewers, I didn't care much for the first half(well, part... it's a third of the projects full length, with a running time of about 25 minutes), \\\"Fiction\\\". I felt I had gained little after it was over, though I will say that the concept and themes explored are quite interesting. \\\"Non-Fiction\\\" proved to be far more worth-while, in my opinion. The writing and direction is excellent in both. The pacing works well... I was never bored, and while it wasn't exactly a \\\"good\\\" time, it moved along as it should, never really too slow or too fast. The characters were incredible... the sheer amount of development, through so little time spent on each... that's talent. As its title indicates, Storytelling goes into different methods of telling a story... and displays some of the most impressive storytelling that I've seen to date. There is some humor, but it's quite black, and throughout the film, I was unsure of whether I should laugh out loud... or cry my eyes out. The film is strongly satirical, very direct and seemingly almost aggressively anti-PC. Dealing with several subjects of taboo, Solondz pulls few punches, if any. Certainly not a film for everyone. Both parts seem to end somewhat abruptly, but that may be intentional. I will say that my rating would almost certainly have been higher had the first part been improved upon... or removed entirely. It's difficult to say who I'd recommend this to... cynics or realists with a strong threshold for the some of the ugliest sides of human nature, I suppose. From what I understand, though, it's less provocative than the other films of Todd Solondz. 8/10\", \"Writer/director Todd Solondz last rocked my world with Happiness, which was the sharpest, most unflinching black comedy I'd ever seen. He does it again with Storytelling, keeping his impeccable edge while exploring some intriguing new turf. No doubt wary after his previous ventures, Solondz attempts to circumvent some of the criticisms that less savvy viewers are bound to make. Sure enough, they go ahead and make them; the reviews are polarized. But the film is a masterpiece.  The film has two parts. The first part, titled Fiction, focuses on a creative writing student Vi (Selma Blair), her Cerebral Palsy-stricken boyfriend Marcus (Leo Fitzpatrick) and their professor Mr. Scott (Robert Wisdom).  The classroom setting provides an unusual venue: a story writing workshop within a story. Solondz puts one of the characters through a perversely traumatic experience, which we witness as viewers of the movie. Before we have a chance to pass judgment on Solondz, his character writes about the event in the 3rd person and reads the story in class. All accusations one might level against Solondz (namely: bad taste, plus every \\\"ism\\\" in the book) get made by the fellow students, who detest the story. But in the context of the movie, they're condemning an account of an event that actually happened! Very clever...  In spite of some of the grotesque twists, I found myself laughing out loud fairly often. Solondz has a gift for rendering subtle ironies that become overwhelmingly funny.  The lead characters are fascinating and multi-layered. Vi seems innocent, but if you pay close attention, you'll notice she's not particularly sincere. One would like to root for Marcus, but his condition doesn't excuse him for being a lousy writer and a self-absorbed a**hole. The professor may be a monster, but he is also very frank.  The second part Nonfiction is also highly self-aware. It covers the making of a two-bit documentary. In the process, the dialog once again anticipates many of the charges some will make against Solondz (that he exploits his subjects and creates a sensational freak show for us to snicker at). There's a cameo role with Mike Schank, who was featured in real life in American Movie. The similarities between the documentary American Movie, the fiction Storytelling and the documentary within a fiction (tentatively titled American Scooby) are uncanny.  Scooby (Mark Weber) is the ultimate apathetic suburban slacker teen. While very much spoiled and sheltered, he is also alienated from, and resentful of, his elders. He perks up a bit when there are no grownups around, but most of the time the \\\"stupid\\\" barrier is up and his eyes are half-closed and red from smoking pot. He's such a lost cause, he attracts the attention of an aspiring documentarian (Paul Giamatti).  As you might expect, the rest of Scooby's family is a real piece of work. Scooby's dad (John Goodman) is loud and domineering. His mom (Julie Hagerty) is idiotic. His younger brother Brady (Noah Fleiss) is a jock, perhaps the closest to what we'd like to consider \\\"normal\\\".  The brainy youngest brother, Mikey (Jonathan Osser) is a real standout. He tags around with the overworked El Salvadorian housemaid Consuelo (Lupe Ontiveros) and asks her lots of questions. His curiosity is cute, but his conceited insensitivity truly boggles the mind.  Solondz definitely favors the sordid, but I'm not sure he does so gratuitously. I think he simply refuses to pretend, as so many other do, that the world is a tidy, simple place. (Those who seek to preserve such a notion are guaranteed to abhor his work.) But is it fair to berate Solondz just because he dares to present what others systematically avoid? Whose vision is more skewed: Solondz for pointing out the dog***t on our shoes, or the mainstream for ignoring it?  I wish I could agree that his writings are contrived and distorted, but I don't think they are. Through the media, through the grapevine and sometimes with my own eyes, I've seen events that are every bit as twisted and \\\"wrong\\\" as those Solondz creates. Everywhere I look, I encounter people who could easily be incorporated into a Solondz script.  Every storyteller recreates the world according to his/her own vision. Todd Solondz just happens to be vastly more perceptive and talented than most. Storytelling is one of the most insightful, clever and thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Watch it multiple times for maximum yield.\", \"Probably Director Todd Solondz' most mature work to date, Storytelling is split into two parts `Fiction' and `Non-Fiction' - yet similar themes underlie both and pose questions about what we call reality when it comes to prejudice and taboo subjects. Whilst in previous attempts (such as `Happiness') Solondz' work has merely been controversial, in this film he berates political correctness more accurately and more entertainingly. It exposes ridiculous attitudes in the name of political correctness, whether it is the student with an awful essay who almost escapes criticism because he has cerebral palsy, or a black teacher who gets away with being a pervert because his victim doesn't want to entertain thoughts of racism. Nothing is sacred: Jews and the Holocaust also come in for merciless examination. But part of the film involves the story of a `documentary' being made within the main story, by an exploitative screwed up filmmaker who wants to do his own thing in the name of art, so in this sense, Storytelling even turns on itself and questions the validity of using the subject matter that it does. A controversial, worthy, and very entertaining film that stretches your ability to make moral judgements within a convincingly coherent framework.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Stranglehold\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0111300\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0057012\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"SubUrbia\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0120238\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Sugar\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0990413\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Sunset Blvd.\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt2256853\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Supergirl\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0088206\", \"total_review_count\": 14, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"This awful, seemingly low-budget knock-off of \\\"Superman\\\" features Helen Slater as the titular character, fighting off evil Faye Dunaway and Peter O'Toole.   The movie is about as fun as a root canal, which will give you a good indication of just how enjoyable it is. It was definitely a cash-in on \\\"Superman's\\\" success in 1978, and the success of its sequels. However it lacks the solid style of \\\"Superman\\\" and is really, really low budget-y and cheap looking.  I suppose this is just ample proof that there needed to be no \\\"Supergirl\\\" movie--at least not one like this. The scenes with the \\\"witch\\\" still make me cringe.  Please, this deserves to be on the low 100. I absolutely hate it. It's even worse than \\\"Superman IV.\\\" Yes, I know that's saying a lot, but it is--quite unfortunately--true.  P.S. I originally submitted this about two years ago but decided I'd revise a few of my sentences. I've gotten angry letters from the \\\"Supergirl Cult of IMDb\\\" giving me death threats telling me that it's an \\\"under-appreciated slice of epic film-making on par with The Lord of the Rings and The Godfather.\\\" I didn't like Lord of the Rings too much.  Supergirl makes it look like the best film ever made.  So, don't send me letters, and don't threaten me. If you think I'm wrong, write your own review.\", \"I can probably go on for days telling what is wrong with this movie. The movie starts out with the descendats of the planet Krypton living undersea. The movie does not explain how come Krypton people,who call themselves Argonanians, are living undersea. The next thing you know Supergirl loses the Argonanian power source (a crystal ball) and chases the crystal ball to Earth. Meanwhile Selena(Faye Dunway) using black magic and the power source tries to take over the world. Now Supergirl posing as college student Linda Lee makes friend with Jimmy Olson, and Lucy Lane, niece of Lois Lane. I lost track during the movie why Selena needed the power source to take over the world, but frankly towards the end of the movie I couldn't care. I was upset that producers did not have the decency to bring Superman or Lois Lane. Faye Dunway's acting in this movie is terrible, the only part of the villian Selena, Ms. Dunway got correct is the appearance. Dunway looks awful in this movie i.m.h.o. The only good part is 10 minute scene with Helen Slater and Peter O'Toole towards the conclusion, but even O'Toole acting skills can't save this film. My recommendation is that this movie is a cure for insomnia.\", \"I saw this movie at a free screening and was so disgusted I wanted my money back! It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen--boring, poorly written and acted, and woodenly directed--and that is saying something. Please do yourself the favor and never pay money to see this, ok?\", \"I felt the script let this down, the story seemed somewhat pathetic. It would have made a good comic book, but surely there was something better to translate into a movie!  It is sad to see how the Superman franchise simply evaporated after the first 2 films. Thankfully rumours of a joint Superman - Supergirl film never materialised, and were possibly idol Hollywood gossip.\", \"From the Salkinds brothers, the same producers of \\\"Superman\\\" saga, comes the first and, for the moment, last adventure of the new heroine coming from DC comics: was Supergirl: the Superman's cousin. The movie is one of the worst superhero's pictures never made; director Jeannot Szwarc give very bad work, as on the hand we would expect from a subscriber to the flop like he. The screenplay by David Odell is really silly and campy; the history is absurd and full of holes. The plot: Kara(Helen Slater)is a blond young girl from Argo city. Argo is a fragment of the planet Krypton in \\\"innerspace\\\"; the survivor Community is powered by the Omega Hedron, a spherical powerful object invented by city's founder Zaltar(Peter O'Toole). Superman's cousin Kara is shown by Zaltar how to use Omegahedron to help inspire her art. But an insect she animates causes chaos and accidentally sucks the Omegahedron down a warp vortex. The magical sphere end up on Earth and falls into the clutches of a evil witch Faye Dunaway....sorry Selena(played by Faye Dunaway). Selena is a second-rate sorceress that lives in a converted amusement park with her sidekick Bianca(Brenda Vaccaro); the witch is studying black magic with the aid of her old boyfriend Nigel(Peter Cook); Nigel is a local math teacher and warlock. The eccentric Selena really is little more than a clumsy charlatan but she is really crazy and megalomaniac; her dream is nothing less than world domination! While Selena plans to use the sphere's powers to rule the world; Kara steals an experimental spaceship and on Earth, becoming Supergirl: the girl of steal; now the long-blond-tressed Kara enrolls in a girl-school as a brunette using the name Linda Lee, while searching for the Omegahedron in her spare time wearing the familiar costume of her cousin Superman. Selena is at that age where she's not the spring chicken; she develops lust for the handsome school gardener Ethan and spikes his beer with a potion that will make him fall for the first woman he sees and of course this women is Supergirl; she and Selena come into conflict. In the final crash the witch invoking the Burundi wand, she screams \\\"Power of Shadow... Appear!\\\" and she summons a huge demon. \\\"Power of Shadow... Destroy her!\\\" Flying up to confront the demon, Supergirl is captured in its grasp and it starts crushing her. Using her amazing strength, Supergirl frees herself from the demon and using her super-speed, Supergirl circles Selena and the wind she creates lifts Selena before the demon; Supergirl summons her inner strength to turn the tables and make the demon eat witch. Magically, the demon with her bore food and Bianca all fade away through the mirror to the Phantom Zone. Of course good triumphs over evil and Kara returns to Argo City with the Omegahedron. The movie's special effects aren't bad and the Jerry Goldsmith's score is wonderful. The majors guilty of this box office flop are Szwarc and Odell but the acting is another problem for this movie although the all-star cast. Nineteen year-old Helen Slater in her first film appearance is a perfect choice as Supergirl; she looked like she had jumped right out of the pages of the comic books for Supergirl, she's charming rather than sexy, graceful and convincing in the flying scenes with her little costume and her nice blonde hair. Supporting cast members include the completely wasted Peter Cook, the annoying Brenda Vacarro, a embarrassed Mia Farrow, as Kara's mother, the very attractive Hart Bochner that was quite good under trying circumstances and Peter O'Toole, who's always fun to watch when he overacts. All obviously were phoning it in for the paycheck. Faye Dunaway's acting is the worst in the movie. She is mostly dreadful as the wicked would-be witch Selena, it certainly wasn't all Faye Dunaway's fault, since she just got stuck with a terribly written character, but she was over-the-top hamming and overplays outrageously. Her character is idiot, boring and silly and Dunaway chews her ridiculous lines with unjustified gusto because her Selena remains the lamest and worst of all the villains from the Superman-related movies. Selena was the baddest evil witch of all time, with scenery-chewing of unimaginable proportions notwithstanding this Dunaway vamps like a enormous peacock but one thing is sure that she is not a charming and imperious witch like the glamorous Anjelica Huston in movie The Witches. Dunaway is really ungraceful and unattractive as a grotesquely middle-aged women that know some magic, gesture wildly, utter some made-up 'abracadabra' bullshit. She looks awful like a true classic witch from tales; with horrid red curly wig and a make-up that make her features coarse and more vulgar she seems a man in drag . But really Dunaway is the only reason for watch this movie because her camping is so over-the-top and her appearance is so bad than she becomes fascinating to watch in its terribleness. She likes herself in a way very narcissistic; I kept waiting for her performance to finally says -I ready for my close-up Mr. Demille-. But truly even cheeky Brenda Vaccaro as her accomplice Bianca reacts with comically exaggerated expressions over Faye's plans for world domination and her defines a horrid human being. There are few moments where Dunaway is really really ridiculous: when she was trying painfully to seduce the muscle-man Etahn; when she was prepare a love-potion with a spider and a hazel's shell but especially in the final when she rolls one's eyes and make terrible smirks and laughs. After her tour-de-force of overacting, her irritating wry faces and ways affected poor Dunaway end up really badly: a horrid monster bites evil Faye's head off. It's a just punishment for Dunaway's crimes against humanity, acting and fashion and it's a great relief for the audience.\", \"The DC comic book heroes are so naturally interesting that it seems it would be very easy to make a good film here. However, they failed terribly. I found the film a little painful to watch. If I had another DVD on the coffee table I would have ended this one early.  If you had to look for good things about this movie you can find a few. The actress paying Supergirl was very good. She really came across as a teenager with super powers \\u0096 a little awkward at times, not always very self-assured. She was really good and had great schoolgirl good looks.  However, it ends there. The dialog was strained. The story drug on, almost endlessly, with lack of action. The special effects were terrible even by 1984 standards (I often felt like I was watching the old Batman TV show). Someone else commented that they thought Faye Dunnaway was good. Sorry, I have to disagree. I felt the villains were just average, everyday, bad people \\u0096 not the scheming, diabolical, evil but fascinating, super-villains typical in DC comics.  If you want a good super-hero movie you need a great villain and a riveting plot that moves at a fast pace. You won't find that here. If someone would have warned me off seeing this they would have done me a favor. Hopefully I am doing that for you.\", \"I started out liking this film, with its fine cast and hippy-dippy Argo City, but the film eventually gets so boring and goes on and on and on.. Especially on the \\\"director's cut\\\" DVD - it has 30 minutes of extra stuff that should have stayed out. If this film were skillfully edited down to about 1.5 hours it would be bearable, but some of the lines are pretty stupid, and the Dunaway character is no more than a cardborad cutout villain, with a pointless Brenda Vaccarro running around squawking about nothing. Watch this and you will enter a Phantom Zone - of boredom...\", \"Fay Dunaway and Brenda Vaccaro are the only real reasons to watch this movie. Those two women steal the show.   Helen Slater as Supergirl was an okay choice, but it was her first film. She's come a long way (acting wise) since then. Still, it isn't her fault.   The story is trite and the action sequences are muddled with silly attempts at comedy.   The romance subplot was mind-numbingly ridiculous.   Even Jimmy Olsen from the Superman films (Marc McClure) had a few schmaltzy scenes.   This is so-not a good movie. Enough said...\", \"Outside of this film's seemingly devoted fanbase (not counting the IMDb user obsessed with Siouxsie Sioux who keeps creating new identities and entering positive \\\"10 star reviews\\\" in an effort to convince the casual visitor that \\\"Supergirl\\\" is a film loved by everybody), \\\"Supergirl\\\" seems to have been box-office Kryptonite. Clearly the magic was gone in the franchise after the first two films, and perhaps \\\"Supergirl\\\" was seen as a means of taking the same idea in a new direction. It was a branch of the family tree that would have been better left unexplored.  Just about the only novel thing about this film is having a female superheroine as its central character, and I suspect it was this identification with young girls that gave \\\"Supergirl\\\" most of its audience. Wonder Woman's TV show had already come and gone, and a big-screen female contender was the next logical step. In 1984, it was an idea whose time had come. Unfortunately, it came in the form of this movie.  Part of the problem is that it's not very easy to understand exactly what's going on in the film. It's one thing to make the audience think and imagine, but it's quite another to make the audience confused; there are some serious blanks that should have been filled in if the movie were to truly connect. The version I first saw was the original American theatrical print, although even the extended cuts of the film don't help explain much. As the movie opens, we see what appears to be a large crystal shopping mall surrounded by bleak nothingness. We learn this is \\\"Argo City\\\", a fragment of the planet Krypton. Somehow it has survived the massive explosion that obliterated the original planet, and furthermore we learn that it exists in \\\"inner space\\\" instead of outer space. This is more than a little vague, especially when Kara makes her voyage to Earth in a spaceship, and emerges in a lake.  She has come in search of the Omegahedron, a whirling, glowing tennis ball that happens to be one of Argo City's main power sources. Kara has helped lose it, so she must reclaim it before everyone in her city presumably dies. Even with this kind of crucial time constraint, she still has time to do a flying ballet when she arrives on Earth (already in costume). She also feels the need to adopt a secret identity as a student at a local girls school and waste time going to classes.  Meanwhile, the Omegahedron has fallen into the wrong hands: Faye Dunaway's. She is an amateur witch named Selena who immediately senses the Omegahedron's power when it literally lands in her soup at a picnic. No, really. Selena intends to use the Omegahedron to achieve all sorts of lofty goals, like making a landscaper fall in love with her. She also wants to take over the world.  It doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, but neither did the \\\"Superman\\\" movies if you think about them too much. The problem with \\\"Supergirl\\\" is that she doesn't exactly have a whole lot to do. There's a dull action sequence involving a runaway backhoe, as well as a scene where Supergirl uses a lightning-charged streetlamp to ward off an invisible monster that's after her. In the backhoe sequence, we're asked to believe that the entranced landscaper could wander around the crowded town without actually looking at anybody, because Selena's spell dictates he'll fall in love with the first person he sees. Of course the first person he sees is Supergirl. This infuriates Selena to no end, and she forces Supergirl to take on a supernaturally powered Tilt-A-Whirl.  Perhaps the biggest liability with \\\"Supergirl\\\" is the special effects. Putting it bluntly, they are awful. They may look alright on home video, but I just had the pleasure of catching \\\"Supergirl\\\" at a midnight showing on the big screen, and the audience was definitely not buying it. The matte visuals look fuzzy blown up on the screen, and an unwise sequence shows Supergirl changing clothes several times in a series of jumpy cuts as she walks behind trees. Argo City itself is a goofy concept. It's wrapped in what appears to be a clear plastic tarp that, when punctured, exposes Supergirl to the vacuum of...what? Inner space? Or the vacuum of this movie? It's never really clear. One tedious sequence takes place in the Phantom Zone, which has morphed from the flying plane of glass in the first films to a desolate terrain where it's possible to set up a roughly-hewn home, and they even give you controlled substances. Where IS Argo City, anyway? Why do Supergirl and the Omegahedron reach Earth by surfacing in a lake? Dunaway's performance, as well as a co-starring Brenda Vaccaro, helps the camp factor a great deal, but what is Peter O'Toole doing in this movie? It seems to me the producers wanted to lend some big-star weight to the cast a la Marlon Brando, but O'Toole's character winds up being mostly silly. Also note how Mia Farrow's credit appears early in the cast list, yet she has about four lines. Aside from Dunaway, whose scenery-chewing performance seems like a continuation of her \\\"Mommie Dearest\\\" routine, nobody really shines. Helen Slater actually does a great job as Supergirl, but the story is so confusing and dull that it doesn't really matter.  A very big help would have been a cameo appearance from Christopher Reeve as Superman, who is nowhere to be seen. Don't drop your guard, or you might miss the explanation for his absence, which zooms by when Selena's car radio suddenly comes on.  Apparently the international and directors cuts of the film helped to flesh out the ideas a little bit better, but the damage was done for this film once it hit theaters. It was generally considered a disaster, and watching it, it is easy to see why.\", \"So very, very awful. You know how sometimes you rent a horrible movie because you expect to be amused by it's awfulness? This movie is the dreaded, actually bad \\\"bad movie.\\\"  After naif space-blonde Kara (Helen Slater) caresses her orb with something out of the Xandria Collection and ruins her space-city, she takes to the sky in super-crappy looking bowling ball to retrieve it. And lucky earth gets her.  The big problem here is they strenuously avoided answering the question: What does a female superhero do in a movie-going culture that prefers it's women inactive, neutral and pretty? It would be difficult to create anything this numbing without having used a lot of drugs in the 70s. Nearly every strange, insipid frame of this inspires the thought, \\\"This is a profoundly weird movie.\\\" The utilitarian script delivers functional scene after scene without regard to logic, human psychology, plot or intelligence. It does however excel at placing loud, stupid moments one after another until there's over two hours of crap on the screen; damned if you could offer a reason why.  Every frame of this is just objectionable. Slater's voice is weird. Everyone's hair is fried. Kara's dad looks like a lesbian. The Utopian Argo city looks as limp as utopias have looked since Lost Horizon. i.e. \\\"We're all mellow wussbags, and we all lay around in pajamas.\\\" The city looks like a mall made out of macram\\u00e9. Total hippy B.S. The cast is a weird, weird mix. The story is elaborate and incoherent. There are easily 5 characters too many. Everything learned about movie-making in the previous 50 years is forgotten.  They didn't get away with it here. But schlock like this paved the way for similarly bloated, stupid movies like Pirates of the Caribbean.  Horrid, misshapen... insipid.\", \"Spin-off of Superman series from the same producers. The Salkind brothers wished to put the series after the failures of Superman III and IV but this in 1984 when he come out was a great box-office flop. The picture-idea is not bad: it's a superhero-movie with the women lords it: all the principal characters are females and the men are relegated to co-starring or to protagonist's love-interest role.   It's the story of beautiful blond young girl Kara from Argo city; a fragment of Krypton planet where the survivals are take refuge after the planet's destruction. Here the live is founded by a powerful sphere called Omegahedron invented by charismatic scientist Zaltar but one day the magical object for error gets lost and was re-sucked in the deep space. Kara takes a spatial device and goes to find of Omegahedron but the powerful object falls in down in the clutches of a evil terrestrial witch called Selena with dreams of world domination. Kara arrives in the earth and becomes immediately Supergirl: the maid of steal: with super-costume red-blue with the big S in the chest and then assumes the secret identity of school-girl Linda Lee and takes lodging in the local college; her roommate is Lois Lane's sister Lucy. The rivalry between Linda Lee/Supergirl and Selena is as for the Omegahedron possess as for same love-interest the muscle-man gardener Etahn. This rivalry remands me to contrast between Snow White and the wicked stepmother because also here the witch hates her arch-nemesis because she's more young and more pretty. In the final climatic battle, the witch evokes the dark powers and stirs up a monster against Supergirl. The maid of steal frees oneself from monster's grasp and wraps Selena in a whirlwind pushing her versus the monster: the witch screams desperately when is devoured by the voracious monster. The good triumphs, the peace returns in Earth and Supergirl takes finally the Omegahedron at Argo and saves her people.   Director Jeannot Szworc gives a decent job: the rhythm of the action is not particularly raging but he is able to render the mood, the atmosphere of comic-book perhaps also helped by the photography and the scenography that gives the right color to the images. The music-score by Jerry Goldsmith is really splendid and gives to movie that lot of adventure spirit that have. The real reason of failure is the poor screenplay of David Odell: the history is silly, absurd and truly unbelievable. Sure the difficulty of production not must have helped Odell: at the last minute Cristopher Reeve, that must have been Superman in a little cameo, leaved the project (perhaps because he their have realized the narrowness) and Dolly Parton that was the first choice for the villainies role disowned, judging truly grotesque and silly. Although the problems the screenwriter is guilty for dialogs among the worst in movie history, for a plot full of holes and nonsense but especially he's responsible for a villainess absolutely groundless and dull that represents the real movie's disappointment.   The all-star cast is interesting; the 18-old year Helen Slater in the title-role is wonderful; she's very beautiful when she flies with the mini-super costume and she gives to character the right mix of naivety and courage; she's the real perfect choice for the role; it is a pity that the picture's failure have run over her and have ruined her carrier still after to start. Then Slater will have in future only supporting roles in a little not important movies. As Marlon Brando in Superman movie Peter O'Toole shines as Zaltar and is splendidly camp; his hamming was funny and entertaining although the character and the lines are very poor. Peter Cook as the acerbic Dunaway's flame Nigel and Brenda Vaccaro as Selena's sidekick Bianca are campy and sarcastically funny; Hart Bochner as Etahan was embarrassing; he's very attractive but his acting is appalling. Marc McClure as Lucy Lane's boy-friend represents the only character that connects this movie to Superman's series. The rich cast is completed by Mia Farrow and Simon Ward in a little cameo as the Kara's parents.   A speech apart merits miss Faye Dunaway as the movie's villainess; she's the evil witch Selena and she's horrible in every sense: her acting is so hammy and over-the-top than in few moments she's very unbearable; the character is unbelievably bad and silly but Dunaway seems to be pleased with herself, she speaks few of the most idiot lines of movie history with a unjustified fanatical gusto. Moreover her appearance is dreadful; it's true that she's a witch but the movie history was rich of witches funny or seductive or regaling or menacing; Dunaway is nothing of all this but she's grotesque, clumsy and with her make-up, with a big wig red-shocking and her bizarre look, she seems a man in drag. Dunaway is a witch and like the true witches, she's really ugly and wicked; in a movie almost all-female her face continually furrowed from grimaces and smirks is horrid to watch. She bears the palm of the worst actress in the movie but especially this time she wins also the award as the most ugly woman in the screen although the presence of the fat Vaccaro. In few scenes this enormous ham female falls in ridicule ruinously: when Dunaway prepares the spell-love potion with a spider and a walnut she's really embarrassing or when tries to seduce Etahn painfully or still in the final battle when she screams clumsily before to become feeding for the monster.  This picture was considered one of worst comic-book movies ever but his ugliness it's such as was a sort of cult movie among the bad movies and most of merits are due to the uncontested queen of the razzie awards Faye Dunaway.\", \"I have seen this movie twice. While I agree Slater is Hot and all that. But It took Warners 4 years to recover from the critical and financial bomb that was SuperGirl. SuperMan was the final nail in the coffin for the reeves era Superman. IN 1989, Warners Realised rather late in the day that Rather than have a campy looking guy who wears his jocks outside his SuperSuit people wanted something darker and a hero who beat villains up.. Warners Re-invented a much darker hero called Batman.  The Keaton/Burton combination together with Nicholsons demand that he get a gross percentage of the Merchandise of that plus subsequent sequels was a masterstroke and revived not only WB but his own financial clout. Batman Returns made even more money as did Batman Forever and yes even the much reviled Batman and robin. Batman Begins Changed everything.  Because it made sense to bring Bruce back to his origins and the switch to Chicago made the film more real somehow. All filmmakers of Superhero movies are all going to do this. Superman Returns will be different in the sense that he returns to earth after being away for an unspecified period of time. They need to consider carefully about what story to give Supergirl.  Maybe they may do Smallville on her, have her come to earth as a baby. In Smallville, jor el used someone called Kara to tempt Kal-el in coming home. I don't think there was a connection to supergirl there because she was never mentioned again. Look at how much slagging the aquaman debacle has got over the decision to replace one with another. People Will not go to another Mushy romantic film as SG. To fit into the modern time, they will have to make her tougher, harder and dark. Just like they did with Batman.\", \"i found this movie disappointing.to me,the story had very little depth,and the villain for Supergirl is pretty weak.there is too much mysticism for this type of movie,for my tastes.plus there are some scenes which just feel like filler.the movie is very slow at times,in fact it can be downright boring. Helen Slater is hot for sure,but that doesn't make the movie necessarily good.the Superman movies,at least the first 2,had an epic quality to them.this movie just seems like it was slapped together with very little thought.if you're not gonna have a villain worthy of the hero,then what's the point?that's an element that should be essential in this type of movie.the scope of the movie is just too small.at the end of the movie,there is no real lasting impact.while it wouldn't say this movie is abysmal,it certainly is not very good either.it won't likely be the worst movie you see, but it should have been so much better.the most i can squeeze out for this movie is 4/10\", \"Dreck heaped upon dreck and topped with yet more dreck.  The lady who plays Supergirl looks like her. But the screenplay is just total cutesy-wutesy cornball dumbness. And Supergirl just sort of ends up being more a naive dingaling instead of being a person from a very highly sophisticated culture. She's portrayed here as a dumb blond maybe slightly more intelligent than a box of rocks, but not by much. In the comics, Kara-El was no dummy, she was a happening gal who gives the baddies a very rough time. You may or may not be able to fool her once, but you'll never fool her twice. But here, Kara-El is so annoyingly dumb, dumb, dumb. She may have been inexperienced in earthly, human ways, but she wouldn't have been that damn stupid. I'm sure that the entire El family, if they were real and had seen this movie, would have sued the movie makers for libel and defamation of the El family.  Does anyone but me wonder how it is that Kara-El could automatically speak perfect contemporary American English although it's not likely she would have known a single word of English as she knew next to zilch about Earth as she was portrayed here?  Did the movie makers even bother doing any background research by actually reading the comics? Apparently very little if any. I'm a great fan of the stories of the various members of the El family, and this is definitely not the Kara-El i remember reading so many stories about.  On the plus side, the actresses playing the baddies were a hoot hamming it up being characters of unremitting egotistical sleazoidness. Without them, this movie would have been a total snoozefest.  Basically, i've found movies made of Kal-El and Kara-El to be of extreme disappointment. They've been overly cornball and so humanish. But Kal-El and Kara-El aren't human. They may be people, but they aren't human people. The movies keep portraying them as human, but they aren't at all, no matter what they may look like on the outside. And even if Kal-El grew up in human culture, Kara-El definitely did not. Kara-El was completely Kryptonian, born and bred.  The only actor i've seen who could pull off being a Kryptonian superhero was George Reeves. His Superman may have been human-reared, but still very much Kryptonian in his soul. And he had a sense of humor. Who says that aliens can't also have a good-natured sense of humor?  Final analysis: This was a chick flick with some of the worst failings that chick flicks tend to have. Like a lack of authenticity and believability. And getting from point A to point C without any defining and explaining point B in between. That effect can manifest without any cause.  If i were Kara-El, i would have put my super foot to super kicking some human movie maker butt for making me look like such an idiot.  And rather than just whine and complain, i call for a remake, but this time, let's do it right. Do a movie that if Kara-El were real, she would proudly say \\\"That's me, alright!\\\" (After she learned to speak English, of course.)\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Superman III\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0086393\", \"total_review_count\": 16, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"The opening sequence to the film, kind of a Rube-Goldberg type slapstick thing which ends with a man almost getting drowned in his car, is a dead giveaway to the audience that this film is not going to be in the same league as the first two Supermans. It's supposed to be funny, but it just clunks along like a tank with lead caterpillar treads, and it goes nowhere fast. Apparently Lester and the Salkinds really didn't understand how slapstick stunts work, and they should have been locked in a room with a copy of \\\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\\" until they got it right.  The movie does pick up a little bit from there, and there are a few good bits that save it from being utter crap: the fight between 'good' and 'bad' Superman in the junkyard, with its denouement where Clark undoes his shirt to reveal the original hue of the costume, is quite nice. Some of the moments with Annette O'Toole as Lana Lang are decent, too - I'm not her biggest fan, but she suits the role of the small town girl that Clark left behind and fleshes it out well.  Everything else until the very end is, well, bad. Going from Terence Stamp and Gene Hackman to people like Robert Vaughn and Richard Pryor is a terrible, terrible decision and completely undercuts any sense of real portent or menace that a decent villain is meant to have in a film like this. You can't believe for a moment that Vaughn's lightweight character and his nitwit entourage would be any kind of match for the Man Of Steel, and Pryor's role, even as an innocent dupe, just isn't what this film needs - he is completely out of place here. Give me the Pryor from \\\"BiCentennial ******\\\" instead; THAT character belongs in a Superman film.   There is just a bit of style and flair in the final showdown scene with the Super Computer where the villains are transformed into nightmarish robot slaves and then Superman is lashed repeatedly with huge energy bolts and pulled helplessly inside the guts of the computer - you actually get a sense of conflict and drama, and the clever way Supes saves the day by using his smarts and cunning almost saves the film.  But it's not enough. 75% of the film has the same problems as the opening sequence - it just doesn't work or hold together. Unlike the first two films, the stuff that is supposed to be funny simply isn't, and most of the stuff that is supposed to be dramatic is spoiled by bad timing or misjudged performances that ruin any sense of involvement in the film.  Rent the tape or DVD once so you can fast-forward to one or two of the scenes with O'Toole, the fight in the junkyard, and the fight with the Super Computer. Otherwise, I think this movie killed the franchise - by the time Superman IV appeared, no one was interested anymore.\", \"Superman The Movie was the blockbuster of its time, an allstar cast, and a fresh new line of Special Effects, and awesome Storwriters. It is the best in the series, and has stood the test of time. Superman II was also very good, it lives up to the first one, and the new Richard Donner cut coming in November should be even better than the one we're all accustomed to! After the first seqel though, is where things began to change...  At the end of the 2nd movie, \\\"COMING SOON SUPERMAN III!\\\" was the first sentence in the credits. Lets get our hopes up for the next one the First two were great! Audiences soon found that was not the case for the 1983 film starring Christopher Reeve and...Richard Pryor?!  WHAT WAS WRONG?  After I, and II Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder were openly angry at the Producers Ilya and Alexander Salkind for firing Richard Donner off the 2nd movie, he had filmed the 1st film, and most of the 2nd when this happened. So Hackman refused to show up in III. And Margot talked about the Salkinds or something publicly about the Salkinds firing Donner.  So...They kept her pretty low profile in Superman III, saying she took a Vacation to Bermuda. This kinda killed off Clark Kent's original love life for the movie. The Salkinds also made some other choices that killed the movie. They decided to go with a campier movie this time. Completely diminishing the seriousness of Superman I and II. Richard Pryor wasn't too bad for the style of movie, but...he doesn't really seem like the best computer genius.  Now to the point, Superman III suffered deeply from the aspects above. Being the only movie to fail to have Lex Luthor, and Lois Lane. It was a poor sequel to the 1st two. And I rate it a 3/10. The special effects as far as Superman flying, and using heat vision were at their best here, but still this wasn't enough to save the movie. The script was also way too Campy. Poor Job here Salkinds. So this movie failed to get good reviews, and lost popularity. The new November DVD Should be great though! The Best part of Superman III was the battle between Clark and Evil Superman. Christopher Reeve was a great actor, and showed a whole new role for himself in that small part of the movie where he is evil. But this was indeed a good performance by Reeve. (But without Lois Lane he had to start over again with the Lana in Smallvill, and Pryor also made too much of a competetor of all the attention)\", \"The big mistake here was the casting of Richard Pryor and the general shift in tone to silliness and stupid comedy scenes. Yet the highlight of the film (similar to Spidey 3) is the exploration of the dark side of a superhero. The whole sequence in which Christopher Reeve turns psycho and ultimately splits into two personas, having a big fight with himself, is the only reason the movie is worth seeing, and most people fail to acknowledge that Reeve actually did some truly good acting here, good enough so that the \\\"bad Superman\\\" is convincing and somewhat scary -- especially the scene where he is sitting in a bar, unkempt and unshaven, breaking holes in a mirror behind the bar while flicking peanuts at it (never mind that alcohol is not supposed to have any effect on Superman). Unfortunately, the rest of the film is garbage.  Aside from this, the story is not really about any central idea or concept. Robert Vaughan is just a generic Lex Luthor with a different name -- think about it, he even has a blonde bimbo mistress like Gene Hackman did in the two previous films. What is his grand scheme really all about, and what does he want to achieve? Darned if I know. The climactic sequence with the supercomputer is simply bad. The special effects are not very good in this one. And where is Margot Kidder as Lois Lane? She is largely absent from the film. Although Annette O'Toole as Lana Lang is a solid substitute, and in terms of her character at least the film is somewhat faithful to the comics.\", \"I'm surprised. No, really, I am. How can people claim that Superman 3 is better than the first 2? Amazing. Truly Amazing, considering the great talents of Richard Donner who brought one of the most beloved superheroes to life in the first film. These \\\"people\\\" obviously have no exposure to engaging and epic storytelling; that sense of wonder and genuine awe, something that this POS NEVER HAD!!! To be frank, the only redeeming qualities of this film are Ol' Supes fighting his evil twin (also known as Bizzaro) and the first appearance of Lana Lang, played by a young Annette O Toole who is much better in Smallville than she is in Superman 3. Don't even get me started on the plot because quite frankly, Superman fans and true believers, THERE IS NONE!!! The appearance of Lana Lang is for lack of a better term \\\"phoned in\\\". In short, Lana Lang was a wimp compared to Lois Lane. She's nothing more than a mere stand in than an actual love interest. The concept of Superman fighting his evil twin is a nice idea, but ultimately falls flat on its a**. As with Richard Pryor, this movie's idea of comedy relief is easily rivaled by the act of trying to scrape a used condom off the floor.  This review goes out to those with an IQ of a 10 year old. Trust me because after seeing this \\\"film\\\" you may want to seek remedial attention.\", \"There are some redeeming qualities which saves this movie from being as awful as \\\"Superman IV\\\": the Rube Goldberg-esque sequence in the beginning of the film (where one mishap causes another & things get worse); the charming courtship between Lana & Clark (for a change, Lana really likes Clark but doesn't care much for Superman); and when Superman's evil twin starts doing naughty things like flick peanuts at windows to break them, or straighten the Tower of Pisa, I think he even comes on to Lana! But it's not enough to save the entire movie from being an embarrassment: the writers & director have overemphasized the comedy, casting not only a lame Richard Pryor (who lost his sharp wit after he almost torched himself), but also a typical blonde bimbo as the villain's mistress, and the guy who plays Lana's drunk ex-husband. And Lana's kid is such a pain you wanna slap him! The production values are cheaper, due to a slashed budget. Reeve and Annette O'Toole as Lana give nice performances, but the film is quite average, a far cry from \\\"Superman I\\\" and \\\"II\\\". Too bad\", \"Not long ago, I wrote my ideas as to what SUPERMANs III and IV should have been for Superman Cinema's fan-fic section. My version of SUPERMAN III picked up where the last film left off, with the relationship between Lois and Clark/Superman dead and gone. In it, Lana Lang returns to rekindle her relationship with Clark while a pair of insane government scientists mass-produce Bizarros for use as a disposable army. Spurned on the basis that such an army would violate human rights, the scientists use the Bizarros to wreak havoc upon Washington and end up in direct conflict with Superman.  Why am I telling you this? Because what I came up with was way better than the actual SUPERMAN III. It's no secret that the Salkinds originally intended the SUPERMAN films to be camp comedies, a plan that Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz undid when they made SUPERMAN as a dramatic film. Even though both men had been fired from SUPERMAN II after filming 80% of the picture and replaced by Richard Lester and the Newmans (who rewrote and reshot much of the final film, and are the \\\"masterminds\\\" behind III), enough of Donner and Mankiewicz's influence was stamped into the film to keep it from being totally screwed up. With SUPERMAN III, Donner and Mankiewicz's influence is completely absent, and we finally see what the Salkinds intended the SUPERMAN series to be all along. And what we get is a campy, dumb, and unfunny insult to the mythos. Not even the superb FX work, a good rescue scene at a chemical plant, and Robert Paynter's comic book-panel photography can make this film feel like genuine Superman.  It's not the idea of having Richard Pryor in a Superman film that makes this film bad, or using Lana Lang. It's not even the idea of using new villains. What makes this film bad is the sheer carelessness and idiocy of it all. For a film that revolves around computers as a menace, the villain should have been Brainiac, the genocidal AI of the comic books. Instead we get Robert Vaughn and Annie Ross as greedy tycoons who sucker a computer wiz into helping them corner the commodities market. Not very exciting. Instead of giving Pryor a meaty, serious role that would have tested him as an actor and have fit into the tone of the Superman mythos, we get Pryor as Gus Gorman doing standard Pryor shtick and not being funny at all. Instead of Lana Lang having some zest and excitement to her, we get a very bland and dull character played by a very boring Annette O'Toole. It also doesn't help that Pamela Stephenson's Lorelai character is beyond annoying, that Lois Lane barely appears in this movie at all (the Salkinds were punishing Margot Kidder for openly sticking up for Donner), that none of the plot threads are remotely satisfying, that Superman is now a bit player in his own movie, that Ken Thorne's abysmal and boring score continues to reduce John Williams' powerful fanfares to shrill and campy disgraces, that Richard Lester's disdain for Superman shows in his indifferent direction, and that the acting is all-around awful. Even when Superman ISN'T evil (and the \\\"Superman goes evil and fights himself\\\" scene is the lowest point in the film), Christopher Reeve comes off as smarmy and insincere (probably because he realizes the film sucks). And let's not forget the horrible slapstick gags, which are totally out of place here. And why does Metropolis have such a strongly British feel to it in the opening sequence? Shouldn't it be more American? Shades of SUPERMAN II's Idaho residents with British accents....  I can't say that this is as low as the SUPERMAN films can sink; the upcoming Jon Peters-produced SUPERMAN movie promises to be even worse. But of the Christopher Reeve cycle, this is by far the worst of the four. To those who assert that this film is truer to the comic books than the first two, I beg to differ. The first two films are kin to the best Superman comic stories. III is kin to the absolute worst.  \", \"Film-making is one of the most comprehensive of artistic enterprises. Whatever other artistic activities it uses, the most essential component is story-telling. One can be subtle, but one dares not confuse the audience.  Superman is supposed to be a good guy, but here he gets some \\\"kryptonite\\\" that instead of weakening him makes a villain of him. Yes, we can accept that Superman could weaken into a real Clark Kent if he so chooses, but turning into a bad guy whose vanity causes him to make travesties of human rituals and culture?  It is not subtle; it is confusing, and confusing a mass audience is unforgivable. Movies are storytelling, and at that this movie fails badly.  So here's how I see the tetralogy:  Superman: the movie .... 7 -- good but not great.  Superman II .... 6 -- entertaining, suitable for occasional watching, especially of one likes the genre.  Superman III .... 3 -- clearly substandard, and best forgotten  Superman IV .... 2 -- What were they thinking? Better yet, were they thinking?\", \"I just watched Superman III and was excited to see Richard Pryor on the cover, but then I even thought as I was paying for the rental \\\"wait, why am I excited to see Richard Pryor more than Christopher Reeve?\\\", it was an interesting thought. But I was thinking maybe it's just because I was just more used to being excited about some kind of comedy, but the problem was that it seemed like the comedy took over what could've been a great super hero story.  Superman/Clark Kent is now invited to his high school reunion where he sees his old high school crush and they hit it off. Gus, played by Pryor, is a computer worker, he is asked by a big boss to play with the computers and control the weather and more! But when Superman interferes with that, they decide to throw some kryptonite at him, but it fails, but turns Superman into a bad guy! Hence the alternate title of \\\"Superman vs. Superman\\\".  Like I said, it just didn't seem to balance right with these two huge movie stars. In the 70's and 80's, Richard Pryor could do no wrong, he was so popular, and I think that overshadowed Christopher's presence on the screen. The comedy and drama didn't mesch well, I just think that this could've been a great sequel, but just didn't excel to what it could'v been.  4/10\", \"I'll save my total disgust for Supes IV. But here is my beef with Superman III:   The opening sequence was ridiculous. I appreciate that the filmmakers want to make a fun movie, but to do a scene that reminds the viewer of the Keystone Cops is off the mark.  Richard Pryor. Great actor. Great comedian. Poor choice. But I guess it's not his fault. The premise of the movie itself was silly. But I love Richard. (God rest his soul...)   Okay...I'm still waiting for someone to explain how someone with no computer training or education can solve this unsolvable code...using print statements!   Christopher Reeve. I'm a big Chris Reeve fan, so I won't bash him. (God rest his soul...) The only thing that REALLY bugged me was that his hair was brown...with highlights! HELLO!?! Supes hair is jet black...or did no one look at the first two movies?   The line \\\"Let's see how long he can live without air!\\\" What??? Are you kidding me? Ummm...didn't he just send a nuclear elevator from Paris into space a few years back? Get real!   Lana's son...Tommy or Timmy or whatever. What an annoying little kid. He deserves to get beat up.  Special effects. Did they fire the SFX people from the first two movies and hire some graduate of Devry? No offense Devry...  Aghghhh!!! I was just so frustrated watching this movie. Oh but wait until I saw Superman IV: The Quest for Peace!\", \"This Superman movie, along with the following sequel, is one of the sorriest excuses for a movie ever conceived by producers. The whole thing just reeks. It's as bad as a movie can get. And the folks responsible for this sloppy, junky, stupid movie clearly had no respect for moviegoers. It's a total embarrassment for everyone involved.   It seems that they tried to go in the BATMAN TV series route (notice how the super computer in SUPERMAN III looks like the Batcave in the TV series) but at least the TV show, as cheesy as it was, was fun to watch. This is just painful from beginning to end.  Avoid at all cost!!!!\", \"I just rented superman 1 2 and 3 and watched them in succession. 1 and 2 rule of course.... but this piece of \\\" needs to be banished from video stores everywhere. not only is ot completely far-fetched with the whole \\\"uber computer\\\" who has more powers than the terminator and my pentium III combined, but the plot is WEAK, and the acting is HORRIBLE. check out the scenes where \\\"evil superman\\\" tries to act tough. oooh.. tough man he is. whatever. dont rent this.. its a 1.5 hour trip into a bad place. even worse than \\\"batman and robin\\\"\", \"Bad, bad, bad. This film could be used as a torture device. I  thought Superman could save anything. Obviously not this movie.   This movie was the Richard Pryor Movie, not about Superman.   Since when was Superman a comedy and not an action/drama?   Richard Pryor and poor script writing made this film absolutely  horrible. It was very slow moving, and went nowhere. I wonder  how Warner Brother execs. approved this. I like Richard Pryor, but  he had no place in this movie. I thought Superman IV was was  worst Superman movie. I may have to re-think that now, after  having to endure watching this one again.\", \"when i saw this for the first time i was more of a kid than now......a little kid and i was a big superman movies fan.....i even liked this one a bit....and when i see it right now i still enjoy some of it....it is enjoyable to see superman turn evil....it is the best part of the movie....or maybe the only good part of it......richard pryor is too dumb at some parts of the movie and the opening credits belong to a Charles Chaplin movie.....a bad Charles Chaplin movie........the musical score is not bad.....mostly because it is filled mainly with John Williams' music but still it could've been much better........the only excellent thing in this film is Christopher Reeve's performance......but the rest is disappointing....specially when the big computer battles superman....disappointing but certainly better than the fourth superman movie........** out of 5\", \"For years, many fans wondered about what has become known as the \\\"hybrid version\\\" of Superman II, which was half directed by Richard Donner and half directed by Richard Lester after Donner was unceremoniously dumped from the project.  Superman II was a very strong sequel despite all the production woes, but has not held up nearly as well as the first film, and now plays more like camp in many spots. Was this Lester's influence, or was the plan always to lighten the tone of the sequel to create more of a popcorn film? Well, we all got our answer in 1983, when Superman III debuted, this completely under the guiding hand of Richard Lester.  From the film's opening credit sequence, a completely farcical series of events, you get that sinking feeling and realize that anything resembling cheese and slapstick in the second film was directly the influence of Lester. The first Superman was grounded in a sense of reality, even if it was a comic book one, which is noticeably absent from much of Superman II. In the first film, Metropolis always seemed like a real city with real people inhabiting it. The second recalled a city on a sound stage with only the vaguest sense of a distorted reality. Well, the filmmakers decided to distort reality further in Superman III by ignoring what made the franchise great and going with a hipper, more today approach. They accomplished this by centering the film around the casting of Richard Pryor. The problem with this approach is that there is absolutely no reason for Richard Pryor to appear in Superman III other than the fact that he's Richard Pryor.  The idea behind Superman III is actually a fairly intriguing one, where a computer genius constructs a super-computer, which in a unique turn of events alters the mental stability of Superman, turning him away from his All-American persona. Suddenly, Superman is no longer the hope for all mankind, but the \\\"anti Superman\\\" intent on destroying us. It also contains one of the best moments in the series, as Clark Kent and the evil Superman actually battle each other. It's one of the highpoints of the entire series, yet still can't avoid being disappointing by the overall poor quality of the production.  I Thank the heavens that a good 20 minutes of this movie was cut for theatrical release because it just made the pacing even worse!, most of the footage cut was more pointless forced comedy moments and the only high point of the footage being reinserted for the Extended TV Version shown numerous times in the late eighties were the newly created opening credits in space, rather then the credits appearing during the opening montage in the theatrical cut.  So what went wrong? I would put the blame squarely at the feet of Lester and the Salkinds, who seemed to want to make a \\\"Richard Pryor\\\" Superman movie rather than a film that was true to the spirit of the characters and the original film. Pryor is given far too much screen time despite the fact that he's not even the main villain. The producers obviously figured that, if they're paying Richard Pryor, they may as well use him, whether it benefits the film or not. So what would I have done differently? Well, the plot about a super computer and an altered Superman is a fantastic direction for the film to go, but that's where they left it. I would have eliminated the character of Ross Webster, the ultimate corporate bad guy, and everyone around him in favor of Gus Gorman, the computer genius trying to dominate the world on his own. The Webster character is totally unnecessary and a more maniacal Gorman working in solitude would have been far more menacing But the catch is that with Pryor in the role of Gorman, the producers obviously felt a need to allow him to redeem himself in the end, so I say they should have removed Pryor, too. This could also have cut out much of the unnecessary comic drivel that ruins Superman III.  Ultimately, Superman III is not the worst entry in the series, but not for a lack of trying. Richard Lester proved once and for all that he really didn't understand what a Superman movie should be, seemingly relying on British slapstick comedy that is taken right out of an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus \\\"where it belongs!\\\" and a pathetic, poor script that he and probably only ten other people found amusing. He must have forgotten that Superman is aimed towards an American audience. The movie does actually start to get good from the moment supes becomes \\\"anti-supes\\\", Watching the dual between Clark and Superman really lets you see how the whole movie could have been made \\\"dark and serious\\\" and kept out of the silly comedy path \\\"even with Pryor and other factors etc\\\" If Superman III had been made this way it probably would have been better then II!. The Superman vs. Clark scene proves this, In Superman II where Zod and Superman battle it out, the end result is disappointing and nothing really happens other then Superman throwing Zod into a Coca-Cola sign, the confrontation in III is far far better!. With all the great characters and history that Superman has encountered, there were really limitless possibilities for this sequel. Unfortunately for fans, we happened to get stuck with filmmakers who obviously were limited in their abilities, talents and taste!. The last 35 minutes of this movie on a whole deserves a 6/10 rating. Why could the other 85 minutes of this movie not of been the same!, The rest of the movie deserves nothing more then a poor...  3/10\", \"The sequence of accidents at the start is garbage. The guy hitting the metal post would fall right back, not to his right. The girl on skates could easily avoid him and not hit the cart.  What are the little flaming things that catch the penguin on fire? If they are road hazard markings, surely a reflective one would be used or a battery powered light, NOT a naked flame. The guide-dog would not run after the other dog, they are specifically trained not to.  Why don't the people in front of Clark notice the burning penguin or put it out and why doesn't Clark take his paper of the pile thats very visible.  No bank guard would fire in a crowded street and the guy in the car had plenty of time to open a window/door and get free. None of the bystanders try to break any of the windows either, which is easy.  The photo-booth would not take pictures so quickly after having money put in and most take money from the inside of the booth anyway. The guy with the bucket on his head could easily have taken it off. The 2 men who fall over are actors but the public walk over the slippery gum-balls easily.  The pie man could have stepped over the gum-balls easily also. Why is the Daily Planet in the same street as the Empire State Building? (visible from the front on the street).  The \\\"hacking\\\" that Gus does is impossible. He uses his employee number to hack into the company system. He's a data processor, he'd have little to limited system access. His terminal would be limited to the task he was doing and nothing else at that time. And any hack would be traced back to his employee number.   Being a data processor certainly wouldn't involve a light-pen in any way. And it's unlikely the Webscoe system would accept commands typed in plain English. There was plenty of space on the road by the chemical plant for the bus to get past if the police car had moved.  Inflammable? Doesn't that mean won't catch fire? Why didn't Superman freeze the acid when he was talking to the scientist. Now it's clearly stated that no-one knows where the half cents are going and aren't accounted for so how do they work out they are being defrauded?  And how does Gus whose only just learned to be a data processor learn so much about hacking so quickly? (like he was taught it when he was taught DP). And Gus \\\"hacking\\\" a weather computer would NOT effect a bank ATM, or Bloomingdales Billing Department, or traffic control (they are totally independent systems). Traffic lights are very basic circuits built into the light itself.  Vulcan can only monitor weather, that's all it's designed for, it would never make weather. This is totally beyond belief, that a novice hacker could reprogram a weather monitor system to actually create weather.  And Gus would have smashed right through the window he landed on when he fell down the building. How can a satellite designed to predict and monitor weather analyze chemicals from an asteroid?  Ricky only told his friends that Superman was coming (who wouldn't believe him anyway), so how did the whole town find out Superman was coming? And more to the point how did Gus, who isn't even in Smallville find out? Superman knows Kryptonite is green, why didn't he suspect the gift from Gus right away? Why do Lana and Ricky live in such a big house? No wonder her rent costs so much.  Superman blowing out the Olympic flame is no big deal, it could easily be re-lit when he left. Oil ship steering isn't computer controlled. They might get instructions by computer but they are steered by humans as the sea is too unpredictable. No ships captain is going to take notice of orders to go to the middle of the sea and stay there. They know the lack of oil would cause chaos. Oh, and why isn't the British Reliance flying either the Union Flag or The White Ensign which she would do if she was British registered.  How did Gus design a computer? He was only ever trained in data processing, Not like he learned computer architecture there. And once again we see The Statue Of Liberty (In New York) but heavily featured as near Metropolis.  Am I the only one who thought the tanker should explode when Superman is welding the side closed? And how DO the Websters balloons stay inflated when they have no heat source inflating them?  The instructions Websters sister gives are useless unless the people she's giving them to designed the computer. And she would have no idea how to operate the computer seeing as she's never seen it before and Gus designed it to his specifications. The screens attacking Superman are from the Atari 2600 Superman game, the sound effects are from Pac-man.  Superman in a bubble with no air is no big deal, he can fly in space in a vacuum. Oh, and the string of a yo-yo would not support the weight of a fully grown man. Why didn't Gus just throw the power switch that Lorilei used to activate the computer at the cave entrance?  The end for this is weak and the whole film hasn't lasted well under the passing of time.\", \"I'll be frank: SUPERMAN III is NOT a good film. Having heard both from people who loved the movie and hated the movie, I watched it with an open mind, but in the end it was clear to me that this movie is weak. Very weak.  Half of the movie revolves around Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor!), a dim-witted computer programmer who becomes involved in crime when he begins working for millionaire Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn). The other half of the film revolves around Superman (Christopher Reeve), as he is reunited with high school sweetheart Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) and becomes evil when exposed to synthetic kryptonite.  One can't help but wonder what David and Leslie Newman, who co-wrote the previous two SUPERMAN films, were thinking when they wrote this film. It opens with a cringe-worthy slapstick sequence, and gets worse from there. Any and all scenes involving Richard Pryor are completely out of place in this film, making it seem more like an unfunny comedy than a superhero film. Director Richard Lester tries his best to make the movie work, but ultimately, it doesn't, thanks in part to the absence of Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and the near-absence of Margot Kidder as Lois Lane (Kidder has a total of about three minutes on-screen). Christopher Reeve, however, is excellent as always, and Annette O'Toole is a good fit for the part of Lana Lang; interestingly, she portrayed Clark's mother, Martha Kent, on the hit Superman TV series SMALLVILLE.  SUPERMAN III is mediocre at best, a failed attempt to continue an excellent series. While it couldn't hold my attention for the 125 minute runtime, I can think of worse movies to watch late at night with a bowl of popcorn and a Coke.

It was truly a lot of fun. The special effects were wonderful. I generally agree with reviews and with IMDB voters, but not this time. I waited until it came to home video which I felt was another reason that I wouldn't enjoy the film. I believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen, but again this was not the case. To me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time. Blair Witch and The Mummy. Both films that I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time. The Mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck. People liked it for it's special effects. Films like the Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development, they are more like funhouse rides. Well with that analogy the Mummy was a B ticket to the Haunting's E-ticket.\", \"What can I say that hasn't been said about \\\"The Haunting\\\"? It has everything that would make a great picture. Wonderful sets, moody music, and sound design to die for were all in place. The screenplay, though, sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird, surrealistic way. The entire team must have forgotten to read it through, maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was. Each member of the cast gives a worthy performance, although with little conviction to the material at hand. Lili Taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her. But that's about it. All I can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours, but you will definitely want more. A lot more.\", \"What can I say about it?It's another Hollywood's horror flick with very high budget(80 million dollars).Not scary at all,it offers us only a few thrills and one really creepy sequence with skeleton in the fireplace.A lot of computer generated special effects and nothing more.Catherine Zeta-Jones is beautiful as always,Lili Taylor is also a good actress.The architecture of the Hill House is amazing,all these monuments,statues,furniture...Delicious!However I don't like the ending because it was so luscious.Check this one out and form your own opinion on it.I give this picture 7 out of 10.\", \"I rented this movie this past weekend, cranked up the surround sound system, and got some great sound from special affects. This movie is a great movie rental, the special affects where enough to scare my fiance, but I noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated. I didn't go to the movies and see this, but its a scary late night don't feel like going out movie. I would recommend it!\", \"Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad film. But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.\", \"I don't know why the critics trashed this movie. I hardly ever agree with them anyway.  The movie could have been a little scarier - I don't usually go to Horror movies! I even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime. I needn't have bothered! ;) (The Cinema was full of kids too, heh! ;) ... Liam was great as always. I also liked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell)  The house was very Gothic and beautiful in a spooky way. The special and sound effects were awesome. I also loved the music score, particularly the gentle tunes for Eleanor and her journey to save the children, how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power, peace and freedom.\", \"I know it is fashionable now to hate this movie. I have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 Haunting as well as most of the Hammer films. This film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it. Yet many viewers can accept out of control films like Scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts. Actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great. I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. The director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense. The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring. Perhaps this film might appeal more to John Carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure. The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963. It was even more scary. See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.\", \"The Haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house, good effects work and sound work, a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house. There are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are genuinely creepy moments in the film and I liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you. What I wish could've happened is for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much. Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up. The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror. The ending was for me, a little anticlimactic. Overall, I enjoyed it. The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump. I just wish it scared me more.\", \"The 1963 version of \\\"The Haunting\\\" has been one of my favorite horror films for years, so I anticipated the release of this 1999 remake with a good deal of trepidation. It hardly seemed that any follow-up could exceed or even equal the original masterpiece. Unfortunately my worries were well-founded: This movie stinks.  I don't know what the people involved in this film were thinking. Jan De Bont, who seemed to have had a fluke when he directed the excellent \\\"Speed,\\\" does as poorly here (or perhaps even worse) as he did with the much-hyped duds \\\"Twister\\\" and \\\"Speed 2: Cruise Control.\\\" Hey Jan, stick to cinematography, would ya? Liam Neeson is adequate in his role as the doctor-pretending-to-be-a-sleep-psychologist -- I don't think he is capable of turning in a truly bad performance -- but even he cannot save a lame script and weak story. Catherine Zeta Jones proves once again (as she did in \\\"Entrapment\\\") that she lacks the acting ability to rise above the material that is handed to her. The female lead, who did great in an episode of \\\"The X-Files,\\\" looks lost here as Eleanor, an insomniac hovering on the edge of sanity. And that blond guy, whoever he is, is more wooden than the laughably strange statuettes of children carved into the woodwork around the house. I don't think he changes expression once during the entire film.  (SPOILERS AHEAD)  The reason the first movie worked so well is because we were never sure whether the house was truly haunted or whether the manifestations were a result of Eleanor's precarious mental state. No spirits are actually seen in the original, leaving much up to the imagination--a hallmark of other great horror films like \\\"The Changeling\\\" and \\\"The Blair Witch Project.\\\" In this updated version, we of course get tons of CGI ghosts, which basically (in the face of the weak script/plot) make the movie totally unscary. The f/x aren't even that great, considering they were done by ILM. The frozen breath looks particularly fake. The effects in the underrated Peter Jackson film \\\"The Frighteners,\\\" which I saw just before this one, were a lot better. The wooden carvings of the children, which are supposed to look creepy, just look silly (especially when they scream), and the CGI monsters are nothing to write home about. Rather than providing a relief from the bad acting, bad direction, and bad writing, the effects only add to this mess of a film.  Some particularly dumb scenes: When the three other characters break into Eleanor's bedroom, and none of them seem at all surprised to find a huge scowling demon hovering over the bed. The scene where Eleanor \\\"sees\\\" the former lady of the house hanging from the rafters... the acting here is particularly bad. And last, but not least, the unintentionally hilarious bit where Wooden Blond Guy utters an uninspired shout of what is supposed to be anguish, leaps up on a piece of furniture, and starts slashing away at the painting of the old, evil guy who built the house. We actually get some satisfaction in this scene, as seconds after his attack, Blond Guy is dragged over to the fireplace by the ghost of the old guy and promptly gets his head cut off by the flue. It was the only part of the movie I enjoyed.  In sum, stick to the original 1963 \\\"The Haunting.\\\" 3/10 stars.\", \"I have yet to read Shirley Jackson's novel, something of which I've been meaning to do for quite sometime. I am sure it has got to be scarier than this film. I remember jumping once when I watched it the other day, although I cannot recall the scene.   The special effects are great and I watched this on DVD, but I am sure in the theatre it must have been an awesome sight. After the first few special effects are done with I was waiting for a story to develop.  I figured this movie at the least has to be loosely based on the classic novel, so a good story should be there, but it wasn't. I was relegated to staring at the gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones character throughout the movie basically because there was nothing much else to watch. Lili Talor was such a suck character. I did not like her one bit, something about whiny people. Also, the guy in this film reminded me of the cartoonish Dudley DoRight with his voice and face. I could not relate to the characters at all. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson did an admirable job trying to get through this movie with some type of acting.  Half to three quarters of the way I was just dying to go see a campy Friday the 13th or a Scream Queenish film! At least there is some type of entertainment value. If there is no story there at least they fill it up with gory deaths or attractive females. This had nothing.   \", \"The script for this movie was probably found in a hair-ball recently coughed up by a really old dog. Mostly an amateur film with lame FX. For you Zeta-Jones fanatics: she has the credibility of one Mr. Binks.\", \"Effect(s) without cause is generally not possible in the real world but in the world of Hollywood remakes, not only is it possible, it's required. The Haunting has been given the computer treatment courtesy of a 1st-class cinematographer-turner-director who once showed promise (Jan de Bont- Speed) but has since produced a string of big budget garbage (Twister, Speed 2).  Actor are superfluous in a movie of this type and they seem to realize it. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones act like they wish they were anywhere but in this film. Lili Taylor makes an attempt to add something to the proceedings but whatever that something might be is unknown since the script feels like half of it is missing. Events just happen, good and bad ghosts show up with no rhyme or reason and then the story just ends with a most unsatisfying non-event meant to wrap up the previous 90 minutes of inanity.  There really isn't even reason to see this for the effects since we all know that anything can be put on screen now. Why not watch effects in the service of a good story instead of just for their own sake?\", \"I don't even know where to begin on this one. \\\"It's all about the family.\\\" That has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a \\\"horror\\\" movie, although this couldn't be a horror movie even if it tried!!! Ugh!!! And I know that Owen Wilson is a better actor. He needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man did co-write \\\"Bottle Rocket\\\" and \\\"Rushmore.\\\" He does have some talent. Also, Lily Taylor should stick to indie films. She has no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There's no room in legitimate acting for her. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, EVER.\", \"Pretty bad movie offers nothing new. The usual creaks and moans attempt to make-up for a muddled, but thin story. Acting is barely above pathetic. Why Liam Neeson signed on for this is anyone's guess. Owen Wilson truly turns in one of the worst performances in recent horror-movie history. Catherine Zeta Jones is fun to look at and not much else although Lili Tayor did an above-average job. The special effects were fairly memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and hauntingly gorgeous. However they can't makeup for the poor acting and the storyline which appears to have been thrown together at the last minute. Don't bother.\", \"It's my opinion that when you decide to re-make a very good film, you should strive to do better than the original; or at least give it a fresh point of view. Now the 1963 Robert Wise telling of Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel \\\"The Haunting of Hill House\\\" is worth the price of admission even today. Now fast forward to 1999 and the re-make. I was left shaking my head and asking, why? The acting is wooden, the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects computers can generate. I had heard that this update was bad; but couldn't believe it was that bad, considering the source material. I was wrong. After watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was, she said; \\\"Well they got your money!\\\" She's right, don't let them get yours. If there's no profit in making lousy re-makes, maybe they'll stop making them or come up to a higher standard that doesn't insult their audience\", \"There were only two things that kept me interested in this film: I was waiting for Owen Wilson to die, and Catherine Zeta Jones.  This was basically a one woman show. Catherine Zeta Jones was just there to provide eye-candy. Liam Neeson was totally wasted in this film. Like Jones, he had no role at all. The film was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). She was the only one that had any real part in this crappy script by David Self. OK, it was his first one and he did redeem himself with Road to Perdition.  I don't know what director Jan de Bont's problem was. he did a great job with Speed and Twister. he really fell down on the job here. Maybe he was still recovering from the disaster Speed 2: Cruise Control. He should thank his lucky stars for The Wild Wild West, else this would be the worst picture of 1999.  Avoid at all costs.\", \"The Shirley Jackson novel 'The Haunting of Hill House' is an atmospheric tale of terror, which conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion. The atmosphere is well set out, and the chills are staged well. A haunting masterpiece.  The 1963 chiller 'The Haunting' stays closely to the book, but also adds its own details to the plot. Fortunately, these are very few, and so the terror of the book and the chills are executed even better on the screen. The black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie. Excellent!   And then, Jan de Bont made this. In 1999, the remake of The Haunting hit the cinemas - if you could call this a remake. Why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself, but for the moment, lets look at the film itself.  It starts off averagely, as most horror movies do. The set used for Hill House is beautiful, and oddly mysterious, and for a few minutes, it seems as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair re-telling. And then, the first scare comes: a loose harpsichord wire slashes a woman's face (Dr. Marrow's assistant). This is hilarious, and truth be told, it nearly had me in tears.  From then on, the film just spirals downwards. The acting seems to become somewhat wooden as the film goes on, with Owen Wilson's character being particularly irritating (so it's such a relief when he's decapitated by the flue).  The special effects practically make this movie,, which is a shame, because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated. Examples of these are many, so I won't bother listing them.  So, all in all, I, along with hundreds of others, strongly recommend that you watch the original chiller, or, as an alternative, buy the novel by Shirley Jackson. But please, stay away from this. And, if you do decide to watch this, watch it on the TV (as a lot of the channels love to screen this film, and not the original) or rent it cheap, but please don't buy it, whatever you do. Don't waste your money!  Final rating: 4/10\", \"How viewers react to this new \\\"adaption\\\" of Shirley Jackson's book, which was promoted as NOT being a remake of the original 1963 movie (true enough), will be based, I suspect, on the following: those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one...and those who have never been exposed to either, and who are big fans of Hollywood's current trend towards \\\"special effects\\\" being the first and last word in how \\\"good\\\" a film is, are going to love it.  Things I did not like about this adaption:  1. It was NOT a true adaption of the book. From the articles I had read, this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to. And, that seemed reasonable, no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of THE STAND! (And not even then) But, there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at, in the movie. Reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of THE SHINING. I didn't like that, either. What the movie's press release SHOULD have said is...\\\"We got the basic, very basic, idea from Shirley Jackson's book, we kept the same names of the house and several (though not all) of the leading character's names, but then we decided to write our own story, and, what the heck, we watched THE CHANGELING and THE SHINING and GHOST first, and decided to throw in a bit of them, too.\\\"  2. They completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts, to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been \\\"born bad\\\". No, instead, this \\\"doctor\\\" got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their \\\"insomnia\\\" (he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear...like lab rats, who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment...nice guy). This doctor, who did not have the same name, by the way, was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from day.  3. In direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies \\\"some houses are just born bad\\\", this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened there...and, this time around, Nel gets to unravel the mystery (shades of THE CHANGELING). The only problem was, the so-called mystery was so incoherently told that I'm sure it remained a mystery to most of the audience...but, then there was no mystery in the first place (not in the book), because the house was bad TO BEGIN WITH. It's first \\\"victim\\\" died before ever setting eyes on it.  4. The way the character of Luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous. He was supposed to be a debonair playboy who was someday to inherit the house (and was a true skeptic of it's \\\"history\\\")...and in this one he was just a winey-voiced, bumbling nerd who couldn't sleep(insomnia remember) and was a compulsive liar.  5. I was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word (the scene with Nel's sister's family, and Mrs. Dudley's little opening speech...) to going off into flights of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than THE HAUNTING. It's like it couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to do.  6. I missed Nel's narrative through the whole movie. The original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person, through Nel's eyes, and we always were privy to her thoughts. That totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version. They also tried to make Nel much more of a heroine. The original Nel was not a bad person, but she was a bitter person (could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister?) and she liked to moan, and she lost her temper... This one was almost too good to be true. This was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writer's had obviously been watching GHOST one too many times.  7. They changed the history of the house and it's occupents too much. There was no Abigail Crain (the daughter of Hugh whose legend loomed large in the original versions), there was no \\\"companion\\\", and there was no nursery. There was also no \\\"Grace\\\" (wife of the original doctor) and Hugh Crain's wives died in totally different ways. These changes, changed the story WAY too much. I don't know whether the producers of this movie should be glad Shirley Jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they should...BE SORRY (if ya get my drift!!! The hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled with!!!).  In conclusion, let me just leave you with some words from the original Luke (appropriate substitution of the word \\\"house\\\" for \\\"movie\\\"!): \\\"This 'movie' should be burnt to the ground, and the ground sprinkled with salt!\\\" My favorite movie of all time remains so. No competition from this one.\", \"The Haunting. A remake, of course. The original was a creepy psychological thriller, and one that has improved with time. Compared to this 1999 remake, it's a classic. There is no character development here, only caricatures (the slut, the authoritative brain, the \\\"I'm gonna get us outta here\\\" fellow, the oh so sensitive bookworm). But, seeing as how the were banking on the special effects being the \\\"star\\\", I guess characters that you can empathize with are a secondary concern. Unfortunately, the effects are laughable. Mewing cherubs, stretchy doors, irritating dead children that can't speak plainly ... and an idiotically sappy ending that does it's darnedest to give you a new age enema of butterflies and rainbows. Ill take my Skittles orally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I've liked you since \\\"The Cowboys\\\". Stop it.\", \"They screwed up this story! In the end Nell is all heroic and taking on for the team to save all their asses from Hill House and a bunch of nonsense like that! They added heads getting chopped, wires cutting peoples faces, and the ceiling turning into a giant hand! What the hell is that about??? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and I love it! The reason why the original movie and the book are so great is because it scares you so much without even showing the ghost. There is no gore. There is no ceiling hand. It is only the ghost ad how ghosts can truly kill a person. They cannot kill us, they cannot throw us about the room or fly a knife into our head. No. They can only drive us mad. Taking away all our senses of security. Nell was a selfish woman. She only wanted good things for herself. Yes, she cared a little for the others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont have taken a crap on this great story! I hate this damn remake!\", \"Somewhere in his non-fiction book DANSE MACABRE, Stephen King suggests that one secret of writing scary stories is to avoid showing your readers exactly what horrible thing is waiting behind the door to get them. If at last the door bursts open and a bug ten feet tall lurches through, the reader may be a little scared, but he'll also think, \\\"Well, I can deal with that. At least it wasn't a HUNDRED feet tall.\\\" There's nothing more frightening than what lurks, unseen and unknown, just on the other side of that tightly closed door, waiting to get you.  THE HAUNTING is so completely misconceived that director Jan De Bont more or less starts off his movie by metaphorically throwing open that door himself and yelling: \\\"Look, everybody, look! It's a ten-foot-tall bug! Isn't that SCARY?!\\\" The law of diminishing returns immediately kicks in. By the end of the movie, the director is, so to speak, jumping up and down, banging his CGI pots and pans madly, and hoarsely screaming: \\\"Look, everyone, look! Here come ten HUNDRED-foot-tall bugs! ... And now, here come a hundred THOUSAND-foot-tall bugs!\\\"   The filmmakers apparently believed that special effects alone could compensate for all the other shortcomings in this endeavor (and there are many). They can't and don't. In fact, impressive as they are, the special effects are so insistent and obtrusive that the distracted viewer winds up staring at them -- whether in admiration or annoyance -- instead of being immersed in a story.  For me, the nadir of this film's sheer stupidity comes when a statue, with \\\"blood\\\" gushing from its mouth, tries to drown Liam Neeson (as Dr. Marrow) in a fountain. The filmmakers clearly didn't know what to do with this alleged idea once they had it, so they just have Neeson thrash around in the water a bit, flailing his arms and going glug-glug. By the next scene, the good doctor has apparently dried himself off and, ho hum, forgotten all about the annoying incident.  Shirley Jackson's novel seems to have been dumbed-down into this ridiculous screenplay by a committee of low-IQ teenage stoners who thought the way to frighten people was to make every effect bigger and louder: \\\"Okay, next, let's, uh, make the ceiling, you know, look like a creepy face, and, uh, come down on her ... and all these spiky things, like, trap her in the bed.\\\"  The sole saving grace of THE HAUNTING is that it at last becomes so awful that it's actually funny. By the time Owen Wilson (as Luke Sanderson) fell on the floor and then went on his Magic-Carpet Ride O' Death, I just about fell on the floor myself, laughing.  Badly constructed, witless, grotesquely heavy-handed, utterly unbelievable, and filled with clunky dialogue and pointless scenes, this vacuous HAUNTING is a textbook example of how NOT to make a horror movie.\", \"This movie was one of the greatest movies ever made,,,, it had everything to make a movie great. Incredible acting, awesome special effects...... oh wait I must be thinking of a good movie. Well this wasn't one of them, it just plain sucked.   What I want to know is, what kind of bone head would think that this movie was a 10. When I casted my vote there were 206 out there, god knows what goes on in their head. Now as for any other vote, a 8 or 9 was even too high, but a 10??? Come on, what made this movie sooooo good to give it a 10? I know these are the same 206 that thought that Jean Claude Van Damme is a great dramatic actor.\", \"The Haunting is yet another bad horror remake with phony overdone special effects and a big cast of on screen favorites and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever except maybe for the cinematography.Yes remakes aren't all bad but remakes directed by Jion Da Bont definitely are.I suppose that the A-List actors (Liam Neeson,Catherine Zeta Jones,Owen Wilson)are there to distract us from the boring plot,ridiculous special effects, and terrible attempts at scaring it's audience however this is a movie not a tabloid magazine we don't care whose in it we care about the characters and story two things this film missed.The storyline is like taking the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and ripping out four chapters and then using whatever's left for the film it is so boring and a lot of it is unexplained.The characters are pretty thin and while the acting is good you don't really care about any of the characters at all.Lily Taylor gives a horrendous performance and sounds like she's 8 years old when delivering her lines not to mention what a horrible screamer she is.Lily Taylor isn't made for the horror genre at all.The ghosts are stupid and cheesy, they look like a bunch of Casper The Friendly Ghost's and the ghost of Hugh Cain looks like a fat guy dressed as the grim reaper for Halloween with a smoke machine.There is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and it's not even funny unintentionally just plain sad.The house is pretty and well designed that is probably the only positive thing about this movie it looks nice but that doesn't save it from it's brutal everything else.I can honestly say i felt like i was wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV for no price so I would've been even more pi$$ed if I had paid to see it but luckily it was on Scream Channel.Overall The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a poor attempt at horror.\", \"The original movie ( dated 19??)did not show any \\\"monster\\\" , it just SUGGESTED scary \\\"things\\\" , .  This version however shows every aspect of a \\\"sick minded ghost\\\" , including unnecessary special effects .   The \\\"mystery \\\" ,as presented in the original movie , was the most scary part : one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened. By showing the face of the \\\"old man\\\" , this Mister has completely disappeared. Even worse : the special effects ( crying wooden children faces) is ridiculous. This is a stupid remake , too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original\", \"So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who get asked to come to this house and (not surprisingly) the caretakers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, the people laugh, joke etc. This Dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids. They get scared, they start to feel stuff. Oh no, a girl see's s ghost. Some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc. This girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls, yeah yeah, blah blah. She does but, oh no, she dies as she does. And goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and escape the house. The script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and Elanor (the one who dies saving the kids) says \\\"oh no\\\". The acting is wooden, the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again. Basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it, but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss. I was extremely disappointed when I watched this. A very big let down. My sister (who gets sacred very easily) got bored in this film it is appalling.\", \"This poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well, then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects. For example, in the original, one of the most chilling moments occurs when Nell and Theo are lying side by side in twin beds, listening in terror to the noises outside their room. Nell tells Theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her. Nell then looks across at Theo, who is several feet away and realises that it was not Theo holding her hand. In the latest version, Nell is lying alone in bed, when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor. It is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened. And can anybody explain what Nell's final words mean - \\\"It's about family. It's always been about family\\\"?  The one redeeming feature is Lili Taylor's performance, but even this cannot save the film. Catherine Zeta-Jones demonstrates once again that, beneath her pretty exterior, there is little depth. In the original, Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion. Zeta-Jones, however has to spell it out, for example, by asking Nell if she has a boyfriend - or girlfriend.  Definitely one which should be consigned to the pointless remakes graveyard.\", \"Considering the original film version of 'The Haunting\\\" is in my top ten films of all time' I approached this adaption with trepidation. I was right to be cautious as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old tosh, all those involved should be ashamed. the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason! you see nothing. Robert Wise used innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work's. The shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from A to B, sadder still is that the ingredients were there (actors such as Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something different. This film should only watched as an example of studio butchery!\", \"The Haunting, if you have seen the original, you know a great ghost story, it's perfection on film. It's a haunting tale of 4 people who go into a haunted house and with the simple trick of sound and movements, it terrified people. It still remains effective to this day if you appreciate film. So when The Haunting was remade in 1999, a lot of people pretty much had the same reaction \\\"WHAT? WHY? WHAT THE\\u0085\\\" But in my opinion if a remake is respectful enough and just wants to reinvent the story for the newer generation, I'm pretty cool with it. This is definitely not the case, this is just a disrespectful boring shame that will waste your time and I guarantee will deliver no scares\\u0085 pfft! PG-13, what where they thinking? Not much apparently.  When her mother dies and her sister evicts her, Nell receives a phone call, telling her about an ad for an insomnia study run by Doctor David Marrow at Hill House, a secluded manor. Upon arrival, Nell meets Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, a strange pair of caretakers who do not stay on the property after dark. Shortly thereafter, two other participants in the study arrive, wild Theo and \\\"bad sleeper\\\" Luke Sanderson along with Doctor Marrow. Unknown to the participants, Doctor Marrow's true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear. Each night, the caretakers chain the gate outside Hill House, preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning, when the caretakers open the lock. There are no working telephones inside Hill House and the nearest town is several miles away. Doctor Marrow revels the story of Hill House. The house was built by Hugh Crain, Crain built the house for his wife, hoping to fill it with a large family full of children, however all of Crain's children died during birth. Crain's wife killed herself before the house was finished, and Crain became a recluse. The first night, Theo and Nell begin to experience strange phenomenon within the house, including odd noises and inexplicable temperature changes. Nell is confronted after the main hallway is vandalized with the words \\\"Welcome Home, Eleanor\\\", and becomes extremely distraught, setting out to prove that the house is haunted by the souls of those victimized by Crain's cruelty. She learns that Crain built his fortune by exploiting kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them when they were of no more use to him. He then burned the bodies in the house's fireplace to hide any evidence. She also learns that Crain had a second wife named Carolyn, of whom Nell is descended. Everyone thinks she's crazy while Nell is convinced this is where she belongs.  Seriously, I suggest you stay away from this film, it's really stupid and pointless. Not to mention the actress the played Nell, Lili Taylor completely annoyed me, her performance, her look, just everything about her, don't get me started on things I would do just to not see her in film again. Catherine Zeta Jones just didn't fit in her role as well and Liam Neeson, a wonderful actor wasted talent once again. The effects are way over the top and too computerized, I just can't believe that they would trash a wonderful classic with this crud. Believe me, if you are going to be afraid of something, be afraid of seeing how you can turn a great ghost story into an annoying piece of overblown stupid\\u0085. Oh, this film is already hurting me, just don't see it, it's bad.  1/10\", \"For movie fans who have never heard of the book (Shirley Jackson's \\\"The Haunting of Hill House\\\") and have never seen the 1963 Robert Wise production with Julie Harris, this remake will seem pretty darn bad.  For those of us who have, it is just plain awful.  Bad acting (what was Neeson thinking?), goofy computer enhancements, and a further move away from Jackson's story doom this remake.  Do yourself a favor and rent the original movie. It still effectively scares without hokey special effects. The acting is professional and believable.  For readers of the book, the from 1963 follows the it much closer.\", \"Well, my goodness, am I disappointed. When I first heard news of a remake of Robert Wise's 1963 film, \\\"The Haunting\\\", I had a fear that it would be ruined by an abundance of summer-movie sized visual effects. But, deep down, I had faith. Surely, with such a talented cast intact...De Bont and company will not ruin a film, who's original was a fantastic and frightening movie that understood the delicate art of subtlety. Well, subtlety, where are you now!!?? My fears have manifested...a promising movie has gone wrong. Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's production design is jaw-dropping; the movie is wonderfully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never EVER do wrong. But, the script puts it's fine actors to the test..asking them to deliver the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies. In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignity...and that's just barely. But, the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us. We can no longer use our imaginations, feel that horrible dread of fear of the unknown. No, we get some visual effects to SHOW US what we're supposed to be afraid of...and you know what? As wonderfully realized as they are...the visual effects come off as sort of silly. And the climax is a phantasmogoric mess...but things had gone terribly wrong long before that.   Everything in The Haunting is overdone and overblown. I'm afraid there are no real thrills or creaks in this old haunted house monstrosity...only groans.

Visually, a great deal of it is nothing short of stunning: an art director's dream mix of Hieryonomous Bosch, Salvador Dali, Frieda Kahlo and Georgia O'Keeffe--and a valid testament to the power of film as a serious art form. Beautiful use of color, form, imagery, environment--and fabulous set decoration, combine with state-of-the-art computer graphics. So, 10/10 for that! Wow!  The plot line is, well, more predictable. You know they'll save the girl and get the killer in the end, but the story is still interesting and pacy enough to pull you in and keep you there. 6/10 for that.  Squirm factor...I won't give this a rating, but the film certainly made me squirm, and I was watching it on video on a tv screen. It would, of course, have a great deal more impact on a big screen. Graphic violence of a twisted, erotic nature in a surreal landscape--even if beautiful--is highly unpredictable. The world inside the killer's head is not--thank goodness!--my world. Because I watched this film on video, I was able to replay a couple of sequences and found much to admire the second time around when I wasn't so nervous about where the scene might be going, and I suspect the whole film would be worth seeing a second time, just for the \\\"visual art\\\".  General suggestion: don't take the kids or conservative grandparents to this one, but if you're keen on the visual look of films, like surrealist art, don't mind a bit of kinky gore, and just want to take a bit of a \\\"mind trip\\\", this one's a winner. Oh, and if you're keen on babes, Jennifer Lopez is pretty hot.  \", \"I couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. There are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well. Though the characters could have been developed better, the action and costuming was well worth the price of admission. I recommend you buy this one for your DVD collection. Even if you haven't seen this on the big screen, you won't be disappointed. I know I wasn't.\", \"This one started excellently. The photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.  Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious. The baptizing of the child Carl was a psychologically too underlined way to embark the motive which Carl 'worked' under. And so on..  Anyway, the movie had great way of showing where Singh comes from. Why is it that the most talented directors seem to emerge from India nowadays?\", \"I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! It's not simple. If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time! Be open-minded, and you will love it!\", \"Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all. This is where the film gets all new and different, as we enter (via a 21st-Century CGI update of Dr Who's kaleidoscopic favourite, the trendy time tunnel) a kind of Hellraiser-y weird world of scary crazy stuff going on all over the place, ruled over by D'Onofrio, now a kind of superking overlord of his twisted mental world, inside his comatose body. The inside-the-mind sequences are well realised and often pretty stunning, all the leads perform adequately, the gruesomeness is to the max if you like that kind of thing, but the hype around the whole thing led to a disappointment for me, as I had expected something completely new and unlike anything ever done before, not this fairly successful blending of serial-killer and special-effect-horror genre staples. Sometimes horrifying, often pretty, a fairly gripping story told with care and attention by talented film people, but by no means the great leap into the unknown it has been marketed as.\", \"It must be said that the director of The Cell, Tarsem Singh, has quite handily established himself with his first feature, which happens to rank as one of the most visually astounding films in contemporary cinema.  The Cell is more of a visceral experience than a film. As a thriller, it rises above most of its peers, with competent editing and a chilling score effectively providing an exceptionally suspenseful atmosphere. However, it is ultimately Tarsem's skill for elaborate and disturbing set design and imagery that carries the film's jolting sense of terror.  As with several recent films, I have been shocked by the alarming hypocrisy among those who have commented negatively about The Cell; in defence of the film, I will address a few of these issues. The plot appears to be the main concern, and while it is not revolutionary and borrows heavily from The Silence of the Lambs, it was never intended to be the most important aspect of the film; the plot itself is a vehicle through which Tarsem's vision--simultaneously horrifying and wondrous--is presented to the audience, much in the same way that the plot of The Silence of the Lambs is secondary to the fascinating study of its two lead characters, Lecter and Starling. While The Silence of the Lambs is clearly the superior film, it is irrational for one to condemn the plot of The Cell, and in the same breath, praise that of The Silence of the Lambs.  My final concern is the mention of \\\"MTV style\\\" directing. It pains me to see the condemnation of directors who use innovative camera and cinematography techniques. A camera has the potential to be much more than simply a tool with which to record events; angles, pans, colour adjustment, and so forth, are all used to their full extent in The Cell with the purpose of creating the sense of a dream-like state that could not have been otherwise achieved. This is essential to the film, as the entire premise behind it is the visualization of a serial killer's subconscious. If you simply want a series of static shots, stick to stage plays and give up cinema altogether.  That being said, The Cell is thoroughly entertaining, terrifying, and breathtaking in both its pacing and design. Anyone who is able to look past the--perhaps uninspired, yet never dull--screenplay will find one of the best films of the year 2000.\", \"THE CELL fascinated me at first glance. I was a bit surprised about that fact, because the story of that movie is absolutely boring. If it had no story, the film would be better. Bunuels \\\"Un chien andalou\\\" comes to my mind- a film without story, but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images. But THE CELL is at first a Hollywood-Movie, and only second a piece of art. I'm very interested in Tarsem's next project. Hamlet on Indian could be very interesting, especially when it has the same looks as THE CELL.  For film music enthusiasts: Howard Shore's score for THE CELL is absolutely marvelous, but a hard listening experience, because of its very modernistic style.\", \"I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.  The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.' Definitely see this movie on the big screen and don't wait for it to come out on tape. It won't be half as good on tape.  This movie is not for the easily freaked out. It will mess with your mind and leave you with images that take a while to forget. But for those who like to be freaked out.....ENJOY!\", \"I do not want to go into a criticism of the movie which I think is - for a big budget movie - quite exceptional and daring.  I just wanted to remark that I am really fed up with the studios policies and the laws of different states which treat their viewers like children. In the database we find at least 4 different versions of the movie according to running time. But, of course, it is likely that there are much more different cuts.  The result is complete confusion and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie (unless you live in Argentina where the movie runs 115 minutes which sounds quite complete).  Later on DVD and Video, the studios try to rob us further by selling us a presumable director's cut (in Germany, there is already such a version around, running approx. 110 minutes).  It would be nice, if the studios would not only think of the cash they make with their movies but also think of their products as a work of art, even at the risk of an unfavourable rating, so that I as a viewer don't have to feel cheated and am taken seriously, not only as a resource of money.\", \"THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10  The Cell, like Antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this film I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched. The film's script can be clunky at times, as can the acting, but the visuals are ingenious and bring the engaging story to an exotic and intriguing life. The Oscar nominated makeup is also daring and careful, while the beautiful costumes and utterly brilliant set decoration went unnoticed. Tarsem Singh who has also directed music videos, goes totally crazy with his direction and it results well. He has major talent and this film has a lot of potential if you give it a chance. Overall, The Cell is a powerful, disturbing and avoids being too tacky which makes it a great, pleasurable watch.\", \"When I saw this movie for the first time I was both surprised and a little shocked by the blatant vibrance of the story. It is a very artistic drama with incredible special effects, spectacular acting, not to mention a very excellent job in the makeup department. Jennifer Lopez has pulled herself out of past roles that dug into her career with this movie, portraying a very sensitive child psychologist who works with a team of engineers to enter the minds of comatose patients to treat them. Vincent D'onofrio played amazingly well. His portrayal of a sadist serial killer was perfect to a T. The sheer emotion conveyed by his performance is astounding. Vince Vaughn isn't my favorite, but still performed exceptionally well. The symbolism and artistry was intriguing and titillating, sometimes surprising, and other times shocking. Overall, I say this is a wonderful movie, with excellent acting and beautiful artwork.\", \"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)  \\\"Do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things.\\\"  --Catherine Deane  And so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, \\\"The Cell\\\" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it. I can understand the reasons some people dislike this production. With a story that combines disturbing serial killers with mind-probing, \\\"The Cell\\\" is too much for some viewers; others will not understand the complex actions and emotions of the film. I think it's one of the year's most engrossing films.  Making his feature film screenwriting debut, Mark Protosevich creates an imaginative world of rich, colorful images and provocative characters. The filmmakers take advantage of every shot. Protosevich conceived ideas for \\\"The Cell\\\" in 1993 when he decided to combine two of his major interests, mind-probing and serial killers. He was reportedly influenced by such directors as Wes Craven, George Romero and David Cronenberg. They would probably be proud of such an imagination.  The film combines two major narratives, one about scientific exploration of the human mind, and the other about a psychopath who murders young women for his own sexual pleasure. Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), a child therapist, is part of a neurological study at the Campbell Center, a research clinic. Because of her empathetic personality, scientists chose Deane to enter the mind of a catatonic preteen in hopes to revive his brain into waking.  A sick, demented serial killer roams the streets. Within an abandoned rural farmhouse, Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) locks innocent female victims in a large glass cell where he then drowns them and performs sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies. The killer escapes from the FBI every time they draw near, until now. A violent seizure renders him comatose. The FBI captures his forever unconscious body. Unfortunately, he already prepared the cell with his latest victim. In forty hours, the cell will fill with water, and Stargher is the only man who knows the location of his victim.  The FBI takes this situation to Campbell Center, where Catherine enters the mind of Stargher, hoping to discover the location of his latest victim before the cell fills with water, sending the woman to a watery grave.  The science fiction portions of the story relied on both real science and theoretical fiction in the creation of the Neurological Cartography and Synaptic Transfer System. The premise takes a long time to develop, but it is worth the wait. It is far fetched, but that doesn't matter. The film makes us believe. Even if you don't suspend disbelief, however, the visual enticement provides an engaging setting to enjoy.  According to the film's production notes, Mark Protosevich was thrilled to work with the director, named Tarsem, because they both think visually. Tarsem Singh is known for his attention to detail, stunning art direction, and highly developed abilities to tell a story. \\\"When I wrote 'The Cell',\\\" explains Protosevich, \\\"I surrounded myself with postcards or color copies of painter's paintings or photographs while I was working. So I'm thinking visually, and Tarsem is a highly visual director. Tarsem has a similar frame of visual references which made for a very smooth collaboration.\\\"  Vincent D'Onofrio provides the film with a backbone, and no actor could have accomplished his character any better. He delivers a mysterious, disturbing, and engaging performance. \\\"I think that my character is, in a way, trapped in himself,\\\" D'Onofrio ponders. He also researched the psychology of serial killers to help get him beneath the surface of the character. His in-depth performance preparation pays off beautifully.  While the actors, writer, and director do wonders with their material, the real honor goes to the film's behind-the-scenes talent. The director of photography Paul Laufer, production designer Tom Foden, costume designer April Napier, special effects coordinator Clay Pinney, and visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug. They bring the world of \\\"The Cell\\\" to life. It's is an extraordinary world worthy of several viewings. Some movies you watch, others you experience. \\\"The Cell\\\" falls into the later category.  \", \"The Cell is weak on plot, filled with holes and has pretty lousy acting as well. but none of this matters, for, director tarsem singh has given us one of the most visually stunning movies ever. the whole plot is just an excuse to let tarsem fool around and take you into the minds of a serial killer, bringing the audience some shocking, pleasing, breath-taking and mind blowing images.  the images from this beautiful movie will stick with you for a long time to come. this movie is a perfect case for the \\\"suspension of disbelief\\\" theory. forget the silly plot, just let your senses be overwhelmed with the images. and J.Lo looks stunning enough to add to the rest of tarsem's work. the cinematography is harrowing, the music haunting & the costumes just stunning.   the movie is less of a movie and more of a work of art. its just that the medium is not canvas anymore, it is the big-screen and celluloid. one of the most refreshing movies of this decade. The Cell is a must watch. A bold new step in movie making.  an enthralling 8!!\", \"A crackling and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist, Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) who is desperately urged by two FBI agents, Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) to use her therapy on Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Ofornio), a serial killer who (uses strange and horrifying torture tactics) is found in a coma by the feds. What Novak wants in return from Deane is whereabouts of Stargher's latest victim is and if she's alive. Once Deane gets into Stargher's mind, which has the appearence and atmosphere that resembles a colorful combination of David Lynch's \\\"Dune\\\" or \\\"Blue Velvet\\\" and Wes Craven's \\\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\\", the adventure begins. Deane sees a variety of odd people ranging from Carl as a youngster (an adorable Jake Thomas) to a Freddy Krueger-like man minus the razor claws. I don't want to give away the ending, but the movie is great altogether besides the dynamite performances, Howard Shore's creepy musical score and directing (by Tarsem, who shows here that he can direct).\", \"After you have seen enough movies, there is very little that doesn't remind you of other movies. Nevertheless this was a watchable if somewhat disturbing film. I had to shut it off from time to time and come back to it later. Like \\\"Silence of the Lambs\\\" it features the search for a serial killer who has abducted someone and has confined her to his chamber of horrors, Like \\\"Flatliners\\\" the main character explores a dream world through an experimental procedure. The surrealism of the dream sequences is what makes this film, as one finds the characters in a situation and landscape in which literally anything can happen. And beyond this continuity and \\\"making sense\\\" are not necessary, which makes it a film-maker's dream too.  The only thing that seems a bit off is the fact that in the end one hopes for the redemption of the serial killer or the exorcism of his demons. You actually feel sympathy for the little boy inside the man, but clearly the innocence of the boy cannot be separated from horrible deeds of the man. The focus swings as it must from saving the man to saving his victim.\", \"A serial killer , Carl Stargher , has been kidnapping and murdering young women by letting them drown in a water filled cell . He is apprehended by the FBI , but is in a coma and his latest kidnap victim awaits in a cell timed to fill with water   Take a look at the above premise and you'll see that there's a very much seen it all before look to it . The magic of Mark Protosevich's script is that he changes a hoary old chestnut plot in to something quite different from what you're expecting . If I mentioned the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter the mind of Stargher then sets up a different film entirely   This wouldn;'t be enough to make THE CELL a different class of thriller but director Tarsem Singh creates a visually striking surreal thriller . The cinematography by Paul Laufer where opaque primary colours are to the fore is stunning but Singh doesn't let it end there , things like costume design where Stargher wanders around his idiosyncratic universe wearing opulent costumes does have a visual impact making this so much more than a run of a mill thriller   What stops THE CELL becoming a classic movie however is that you start becoming more and more aware that the whole movie revolves around the visuals rather than having a natural narrative . We see a third character , a FBI man enter Stargher's domain but this seems more like a contrived plot turn just to introduce the audience to more stunning but very disturbing moments  It should also be pointed out that this is a rather disturbing thriller with a atmosphere that is very depressing and that stops the film from being if not enjoyable , then involving . One scene where a FBI agent recounts a case where a paedophile beats a rap only to later cut out the heart of his victim will fill your heart with so much despair you might reach for the off button . You'll probably have to watch a massive amount of thrillers till you see another one as disconcerting as this one\", \"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. I never got the chance to see it though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should watch it. After all I did love \\\"Silence of the Lambs\\\" and \\\"Se7en\\\", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of \\\"The Cell\\\". The whole story concept is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in. The acting is actually pretty decent. Jennifer Lopez is the only one I have to say that wasn't that great, but she does a believable job. I would recommend for a scary thriller.  7/10\", \"\\\"The Cell\\\" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, \\\"a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim\\\", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing. And there is most definitely a horror facet due to the sickening actions of the serial killer's evil persona. The movie attempts to function on many different levels and crosses genre boundaries at will. While I feel it ends up being a reasonably bizarre experience, I find it to be completely fascinating.  Right from the opening credits, with Lopez riding a horse through the desert stunningly clothed in a white dress, you will know that you are in for a visual treat. Every time the audience leaves reality and follows her into the sub conscious depths of her \\\"patients\\\", they are guaranteed a feast of visual and aural delight. The costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colour. The camera leaves regularities at the door and traverses a world where up and down are the same. The characters become rulers of their own domains and transform into creatures worthy of such stature. If you don't enjoy anything else about \\\"The Cell\\\", you will surely be impressed with the work put into these scenes.  The casting is top notch also. Jennifer Lopez is in her element here, utilizing her natural, compassionate and almost maternal sensibilities, while combining her own striking looks with the lush surroundings, makeup and costumes. She is incredibly sexy and I personally wish someone would find another role for her outside of the rom-com world she has been typecast into that would allow her to experiment further. Vince Vaughn is fairly convincing as an FBI agent that will do anything to save the life of a young woman. But it is without a doubt Vincent D'Onofrio that has the biggest impression here. It's an extremely difficult role as he is required to bring out multiple emotions within the viewer. We are disgusted at his actions, yet sympathetic towards him due to the trauma he has experienced during his life. He looks magnificently powerful within his realm, yet insecure and vulnerable within the real world. It's a great performance from an underrated actor.  While \\\"The Cell\\\" doesn't work as well on every level it ambitiously attempts (some of the actions of the characters are not believable) and while it is all based on some fairly flimsy scientific logic, it is an occasionally shocking, visually astounding head trip that rewards multiple viewings.\", \"\\\"The Cell\\\" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.  I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. This movie may be a landmark, a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. \\\"The Cell\\\" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we don't want any more? Personally, I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem, and would love to see someone try to challenge him.  We've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer, and yes, I do agree that the \\\"genre\\\" is a bit overworked. The 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed. But \\\"The Cell\\\" does not blaze down the same trail, we are given a new twist, we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.  I like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another. Instead, she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. \\\"The Cell\\\" wants to let you \\\"see\\\" what it's all about and not \\\"how\\\" it's all about, and I guess that's what some people don't like. True, I do like explanations with my movies, but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.  I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality, maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another. Nonetheless, the set design was simply astonishing. I wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography, best costumes, best director and the like. If it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture.  I've noticed that I've kind of been repeating myself. Not because there's nothing else to say, but because I can't stress enough how fantastic I thought \\\"The Cell\\\" was. If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time. I guess this film was just a little too much for some people, writing it off as \\\"weird\\\" or \\\"crazy\\\". I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was right down my alley. Leaving the theater, I heard one audience member say \\\"Whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs.\\\" If so, I want what he was smoking.  **** (out of 4)\", \"What makes watching and reviewing films a pleasure is when every once in a while when you least expect it a film like The Cell comes along and knocks your socks off!. This movie is a superb horror that has everything a you could want when you want to be scared out of your witts. Without going into the story all i will say is that it has a great beginning ,middle and end that keeps you on the edge of your seat while being transfixed with the amazing special affects. The acting is good without being outstanding but that does not matter because the subject matter and the way it is put on the big screen makes this one of the best horror movies i have seen for a long while. It is one of those films that you imagine started as a novel but saying the credits it does not look like an adaptation , so a lot of credit must go to Mark Protosovich the writer. 9 out of 10.\", \"Style over substance. But what a style it is. \\\"The Cell\\\" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.  Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim.   Director Tarsem Singh has incredible visions and set pieces for this production. Each dream sequence is like a nightmare-ish painting in motion, from the landscapes to the costumes.   But the plot suffers from lack of history of its characters. Stargher is the only person with a thorough background and he's the last person you want to care about. Without him, you basically have a movie that moves in the present tense only, which is a shame since the movie is so visually stunning and genuinely scary. Lopez is wasted but she's not that amazing an actress anyway, though she's as gorgeous as ever. And Vince Vaughn? I don't even know why he was chosen. This is not his forte and he overacts to boot. He tried too hard to become his character and it showed. Stick to comedy, Vince! Even so, this movie is so visually frightening, I still watch this movie with the lights on and can never fall asleep right away afterward.\", \"This movie is definitely a case of style over substance but the style is good and certainly more than unique on its own to make \\\"The Cell\\\" a memorable and above average movie.  \\\"The Cell\\\" is beautifully looking with impressive sets, costumes and make-up. Yes, it's real eye candy to watch all. The movie has some perfectly 'dreamy' sequences that are certainly odd but also very beautiful and imaginative to look at. This movie is a perfect mix of an art-house type of movie and a typical Hollywood-thriller, that is accessible to both fans of the genre.  The story itself is pretty far fetched and doesn't always make sense. Because of that the movie isn't always pleasant and likable to watch but like I mentioned before, the style compensates for this. The style makes you keep watching till the end and provides the best moments of the movie.  Vincent D'Onofrio is unforgettable as the serial-killer with a twisted mind. Vincent D'Onofrio is really underused as an actor and this movie shows his talent once more. I'm not particularly happy about the casting of Jennifer Lopez. I know that she can act in some of her movies but she really wasn't suitable to play the main character in this movie. Her character wasn't strong enough and she was overshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. Still I felt that Vince Vaughn was also miscast in this movie. He didn't fit the role well enough and no, I'm not saying that because I'm used of seeing him only in comedies now days. The rest of the supporting cast is good and still give the movie a certain degree of credibility.  The musical score by Howard Shore was also surprising good and was sort of \\\"Se7en\\\" like at times. It suited the movie well and gave some of the scene's some extra mood and atmosphere.  It's a far from perfect movie and the concept is far fetched and not always handled in the right way. Still \\\"The Cell\\\" is a perfectly watchable movie and perhaps even a bit of a must see, due to its style, originality and creativity.  7/10\", \"The last film that provided a vivid and disturbing look at what insanity is probably like was In Dreams. In that movie, you didn't see insanity, you were THERE. Now The Cell comes along with an updated and much more disturbing portrayal of the inside of the mind of a psychotic killer. The opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent mind of a comatose little boy, and the things that Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are first fascinating and then terrifying. The things that she later sees in the mind of Vincent Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) are amazingly imaginative and fascinating, most of this stuff has never been seen in film before.  The story of The Cell is not exactly something that is really groundbreaking. In fact, it is basically the same as the story in The Silence of the Lambs. You have a killer in custody and these people have to enter his mind to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life. The only real difference between the foundation of the plots is that in The Silence of the Lambs, you have to enter the mind of a killer to find a different killer as well as his current victim, while in The Cell, you have to enter the mind of a killer to find his own victim. However, despite the unfortunately weak story, The Cell completely revolutionizes the genre of the psychological thriller. None that have ever been made even come close to it.   Also, the film had good direction and was extremely well acted. Vince Vaughn delivers another of his characteristically excellent performances (he was even good as Norman Bates in the pathetic 1998 re-make of Psycho), and even Jennifer Lopez puts forth the second good effort of her career (the other being the great Out of Sight). Nothing can be said of the cinematography in The Cell to give it sufficient credit, it was imaginative and fascinatingly done and is unparalleled by anything ever seen in cinematic history. The Cell is an incredibly well-made film, and it deserves to be recognized.\", \"'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.  We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality. She and other scientist including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) believe that this method might work. Catherine enters the mind of the boy and speaks with him there, in a world that is completely created by the boy. She hopes she can let him do things that in the end will give results.  The real story then. A serial killer named Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) just dumped the body of one of his victims. FBI Agents Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Novak (Vince Vaughn) are on this case. Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears and at that time, after forensic research on the dumped body, Carl can be traced and captured. Two problems occur. 1. Carl just went into a coma; he has been sick for a long time. 2. His house and the house with his last kidnapped victim are not at the same place. In a way this part of the story is pretty standard.  Things are about to get interesting again. To find out where the girl is, Catherine has to go into Carl's mind. This is dangerous for a lot of reasons. In short: Carl is unknown territory, schizophrenic and a serial killer. If Catherine starts believing Carl's mind is the real world then her mind can convince her body; she could die in the mind of Carl. A tape of how the last victim was killed, a fate this girl will have in about twenty hours, makes sure Catherine will try to get the location out of Carl's mind.  It is the journey through this sick mind that makes this film more than worth watching. Director Tarsem Singh, who did music videos before this, in a way goes back to these music videos. Every room in the imaginative world is another short clip that exists out of beautiful and sometimes haunting images. For me the visual style felt completely new, the way 'Three Kings' had a new visual style one year earlier. If something like that can make you like a film, 'The Cell' will not disappoint. But fans of the thriller and horror genre can like this film anyway. The story itself, without the great fantasy world, is good enough for that. I think you have to be a little open minded, of course events are not (yet) possible in our real world. Still, a very entertaining film with nice ideas that looks terrific.\", \"Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama. A must see for anyone seriously interested in cinematography and the use of the film cell as a canvas on which to display true works of visual art. I would have to give this movie a 9/10 for it's amazing visual display.\", \"Why do the powers that be continue to cast Jennifer Lopez in unbelievable roles? She was excellent in Selena, and pretty good in Money Train, which both cast her in roles where she could basically be herself. However, roles like this just draw the line. I could never see Lopez as an FBI agent (see Out of Sight for that unremarkable performance), but as a psychotherapist? Give me a break!  Basically, Lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist, who is involved in virtual reality experiments in which she enters the minds of her patients in order to help them sort out their issues. When she enters the mind of a comatose serial killer to help save one of his victims, she breaks all the rules to try and crack the insanity of his inner mind.  Lopez's acting here is typically below average. I can't get over that high-pitched squeak of a voice she has. She's no Julia Roberts, but yet she comes across on screen as though she believes herself to be on the same playing field. Well, she's not even in the same stadium. Sure, she is a very sexy lady; however, that isn't going to carry a film, and it certainly doesn't carry this one. With anybody else cast in her role for this film it would have been excellent, especially if it was cast with someone who could lend more credibility to the character.  Having said all that, this film is visually stunning. The colors are fabulous, and the story line isn't half bad in a B-movie kind of way. The audio here is superb as well. This movie gains some points for the fairly original storyline, and major points for how it looks and sounds. Unfortunately, the acting and poor casting bring it down a few notches.  My Rating: 6/10\", \"I love exotic science fiction/fantasy movies but this one was very unpleasant to watch. Suggestions and images of child abuse, mutilated bodies (live or dead), other gruesome scenes, plot holes, boring acting made this a regretable experience, The basic idea of entering another person's mind is not even new to the movies or TV (An Outer Limits episode was better at exploring this idea). i gave it 4/10 since some special effects were nice.\", \"If you like to watch movies because they are pretty, you should be okay with this one. If you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy, then reveal clues to the motives of each throughout the movie, skip it. At the end of the movie i still didn't know why Stargher killed the women the way he did. When you set up such a ritualistic serial killer it would be nice to know where the rituals originated from. In Dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer which also wasn't the best, but at least the whys of how he killed the girls was explained. They also hinted at a dark background for Vaughn's character but didn't explain, didn't really say why Lopez's child psychologist was so much better suited for this task than the rest of the people they interviewed, didn't give much of an explanation for the little kid's problem, etc. If the rest of the story is compelling, I don't care about details like how Stargher afforded all the fancy electronic equipment and underground chambers or why the FBI wasn't checking to see if he owned any other property or had access to out of the way places while they were waiting to see if the whole entering the killer's mind thing would work, but I do like to have a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex manner.\", \"As I said the idea itself was great and it had plenty potential. I was truly sad of discovering that this was another typical American mass movie: \\\"We are in this for the money...\\\" If only the producers had had more time to actually MAKE the movie. This one was not finished when they let it out...\", \"I really enjoy this genre but The Cell was one of the worst movies I've ever been unfortunate enough to watch. While about 25 percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theater during the viewing (or left entirely) I was dumb enough to stick it out. The main problems with this story (there were too many to list all) is that with this type of film you have to do two things... one, provide fear of the killer (being that they catch him twenty minutes into the film that's gone) and you must give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that you actually care whether they get to her in time or not. Not only did I lose track of the girl, I was given such little insight into her that she was only a blurry face and when I did remember she was part of the story I really didn't care what happened to her. While the visuals were interesting in an LSD flashback sort of way, they often times made no sense and this should be a lesson that visuals can't make up for lack of a good story (see Phantom Menace for another example) Finally, does anyone know or care what was up with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky?

All the elements of a great film are there, ruined if it had been shot in colour, ruined if the tune had been played on a piano, ruined if the echoes had been on modern Hi-fi, ruined if it had been any other way.  \", \"After watching the film, I looked over its reviews and I was not surprised by the vast divergence of opinion concerning it. It doesn't meet the expectations that many have for a movie. While I side with those that think the movie is great, I think many of the people who loved it praised it for the wrong reasons. This is not a movie with a \\\"gripping\\\" plot or characters you will remember for the rest of your life (and yes the zither music would seem out of place if you're seeking pathos). But to criticize the movie for those reasons (as many reviewers did) seems like criticizing \\\"Ulysses\\\" for being a little slow-going. Everything in the movie is DESIGNED to create the utmost emotional detachment for the viewer. Examples include the zither music, the dispassionate and unsympathetic characters, the lack of concern demonstrated by the protagonist concerning his danger (denying the viewer real suspense), the absence of \\\"preaching\\\" about the horrors of post-War Europe, the refusal to show the film's climax, and shots that make you want to look at the architecture rather than the people. Thus, despite the fact that film's story is depressing in the extreme, the persistent mood of the film is a satisfying mixture of melancholy, amusement, and cheerfulness. The effect, made possible by its detachment, provides a proper emotional seeting to contemplate the aesthetics of the movie's superb cinemeotraphy. In conclusion, if you're looking for thrills or even deep thoughts, don't watch this movie. But if you want a cheerfully detached work of art, this is the movie for you.\", \"The perfect ending, the great theme that will play in your head for days afterwards, love, post war Vienna, black market scams, a faked death, a friends betrayal for what is right and Welles. If you have any doubt about how good this genius was, check this movie out.

Check it out and see if you can hate Orson when he flashes you that smile.\", \"SPOILER  I would like my 50th user comment to celebrate a rather special film, so what better than a thanksgiving for \\\"The Third Man\\\".  It would go something like this....\\\"'I never knew the old Vienna before the war with its - 'what?\\\" \\\"What city is next mentioned?\\\" \\\"'That's a nice girl that. But she ought to be careful in Vienna....' Who is speaking and what is the next line?\\\" \\\"'Mr Martins, what author has chiefly influenced you?' How does he reply and what is the response?\\\"...And so it would go on. Time - circa 1950; place - a grammar school North-West of London; speakers - a group of 6th formers during a school break testing each other's knowledge about their latest cinematic discovery. If we had known the term \\\"cult film\\\" in those days \\\"The Third Man\\\" would have been ours. We were just a little too young to have been affected by \\\"Casablanca\\\", \\\"The Maltese Falcon\\\" or \\\"The Big Sleep\\\" and \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" did not really become known in this country until way after it was made. No, \\\"The Third Man\\\" was ours and I still think it as light-years away from the others I have mentioned in quality. We saw it on every available occasion and it was not long before I had chalked up ten viewings. Imagine my excitement when I was staying with my French exchange partner and he suggested we go to a cinema in Angers to see \\\"Le Troisieme Homme\\\". It was great sharing it with him and his mother and as I almost knew the dialogue by heart by then, I understood every word. in spite of my limited French. Just a few reflections many years on about a work that has been part of my experience for almost as long as I can remember. I could go on at great length about those tremendous set-pieces, Harry Lime's appearance in the doorway, Holly Martin's disastrous performance at the literary meeting, the ride on the Ferris wheel and the sewer chase, but it has all been said before. In any case visual and dramatic bravura alone do not make for greatness. \\\"The Third Man\\\" is a masterpiece because it states, or rather understates, some most perceptive things about the human condition. It is really a film about unrequited love. In a work where chases predominate it is the pursuit by Holly Martins for the affection of Anna Schmidt, Lime's lover, that is at the real heart of things. It is impossible to understand human chemistry, why Anna should be attracted to the amoral and ruthless Harry rather than kindly Holly who wants so much to give. But then there is an even greater irony inasmuch as Holly too is drawn to Harry; after all they have friends since boyhood. When Harry is finally cornered it is Holly who pulls the trigger that puts him out of his misery, like an act of kindness to a wounded beast. Carol Reed was at the height of his powers when he made \\\"The Third Man\\\", but he still had something almost as great to give before his slow decline. Perhaps I shall save the wondrous \\\"Outcast of the Islands\\\" for my hundredth offering.\", \"I envy anyone seeing this for the first time; I was young when I first saw it and was quite entertained, but couldn't get the most out of it.  Now I've watched it many times and realize the masterful integration of plot, setting, characters, sound, scene, pace, etc. that make it a great flick.  The Criterion DVD is very nice (should be, at that price), especially the original Graham Greene story and his comments.\", \"One of the finer films ever made. Masterful direction and screenplay set against a dreary but romantic postwar Austria. Even if you dont dig film noir, you will enjoy this. Pop it in the VCR sometime after midnight and soak it in baby.\", \"This movie is so good that I barely feel qualified to comment on it. I first saw it as a 7 year old in the early 50s and, although unable at the time to appreciate its full qualities, I remained strangely moved by it and have been haunted by it ever since. This is the only perfect movie ever made. I guess most of the great things about photography and charisma and zither theme and story have been said by people far more articulate than I. However, there are two points I would like to make. Firstly, the camera angles seem to be designed to preclude the viewer from ever being comfortable in involvement with what is not meant to be a comfortable story. Secondly, the ending is just perfect, but the scene just prior to the ending is even more so. Watch as Lime is trapped in the sewer and Calloway tells Martins to shoot him. Harry turns to Holly and gives an almost imperceptible nod, and Holly pulls the trigger. Now that has some impact!\", \"The Third Man is a noir thriller set in postwar Vienna which tells the story of a couple of Americans trying to renew a childhood friendship in a foreign country after growing up to be very different people. Like all of Graham Greene's fiction, the film makes themes of betrayal, the loss of innocence, and the true difficulty of forming apparently simple moral judgements.  Many people count this as their favourite movie, which is remarkable for a British film of the 1940s. It is just a very successful coming-together of many wonderful talents: Greene wrote a classic screenplay, Carol Reed's direction is inspired genius, and Orson Welles, Trevor Howard, Joseph Cotton and others contributed unforgettable performances. Anton Karas's theme music is legendary. The cinematography is stunning.  You can become obsessed with this film, and if you do you will want to read Charles Drazin's excellent 1999 book \\\"In Search of the Third Man\\\". I also recommend the reviews by the eminent British critic Philip French, who has much of interest to say about the sources for Greene's screenplay.\", \"Just about my favorite black and white movie. And a fine mystery at that. Cotton, Wells, Valli and the rest of the cast all fit their roles. Hyde-White as Crabbin injects that bit of surprise into the movie. Valli gives you that hopeless feeling that many people felt after the war. I cant think of anyone else that could have done the roles better. The chase scenes are legend. You just cant find movies like this anymore.\", \"Many superlatives have already been said, and deservedly so, about this excellent film. A suspenseful mystery, well-acted by all major characters. Welles especially, as the mysterious Harry Lime, personifies evil even more effectively (if that's possible) than characters such as Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs) or Andy Robinson (Dirty Harry). Who can forget Lime's words spoken from the top of Vienna's ferris wheel about being paid for stopping those \\\"dots below\\\" (people) from moving or his Italy & Renaissance v Switzerland & cuckoo clock comparison. Simply, a \\\"must see\\\" film.\", \"  Dig that Zither music! The musical score makes this movie.   The Third Man isn't as great as all the hype it gets, but it is an entertaining film. Alida Valli is a standout as Anna and Joseph Cotton is very good as Holly Martins.   *****************Mild Spoilers Ahead*********************************  The opening scene at the funeral near the beginning of The Third Man has something hauntingly memorable about it. There's also clever use of a cat involved in an eerie scene that reveals Harry Lime. The ferris wheel scene is absorbing. And of course there is the desperation of the ruthless and clever Harry Lime (Orson Wells) when he is chased in the sewer. And don't forget the ending with Anna (Alida Valli) walking along the road a second time just like an earlier scene. This film has many fine moments and it is well crafted. Carol Reed, the director, had a nice touch. I don't think the cinematography deserved a best Oscar, though. The film wasn't lit up enough in some scenes. Dark lighting is ok and realistic, but you can go so far that you miss much of the action.  Then of course there is the zither music. It's wonderful.  I rate this film a 9 out of 10. Very watchable, but I'm not sure it's a classic.\", \"One of the top 100 films of all time. This film tells the story of an American writer's journey to a post-war Vienna in search of a friend he thought he knew. Ultimately he learns his beloved friend is very different from the one he had once known and loved. He is destroyed by this discovery and the choice he must make. The acting is superlative, the cinematography, haunting & the story tells a truth for all time. See it.\", \"This stunning film noir's politics may seem a bit dated, but besides that it hasn't aged a day. The cinematography is brilliant, the performances flawless. Easily ranks with Chinatown, The Maltese Falcon and Touch of Evil among the great film noirs of all time. Orson Welles leaves a lasting impression in his mere 3 scenes. Joseph Cotton is brilliantly restrained as the out of his depth American writer. Carol Reed's direction is magnificent. That last shot is, in my opinion, the best ending to a film noir EVER.\", \"A masterpiece from all aspects. The black and white cinematography depicting each detail (and wow what shadows), the cast of splendid actors and actress, even those playing minor roles, not sparing any facial details!! And oh what background of Zither music. They surely do not make such movies any more.\", \"Just a few notes on exceptional scenes, what's in them and what's not: 1) the ending, the framed shot that lingers for 50 seconds as Anna advances down the esplanade of the cemetery towards Holly and beyond; 2) the hospital scene: not a single shot of the children, but the tattered teddy bear was enough; 3) the wait for Harry to show in the cafe`: the close-ups of the faces of the military men waiting in ambush were straight out of Leni Riefenstahl's \\\"Triumph of the Will\\\" and with the same dramatic impact; 4) the total absence of sizzling sex scenes, profanity, & gory violence (with one exception, none of the men killed is seen being killed, and in that one case there is no gore, only a quick hitting sadness); 5) and couldn't it have been just possible that Anna was wanted by the Soviets as a war criminal? Here's where Graham Greene's screenplay was strictly Cold War boilerplate: The Russians were necessarily the \\\"bad guys,\\\" prepared to harbor a scumbag like Lime and persecute a sensitive soul like \\\"Anna Schmidt\\\" (maybe she'd been the lover of a high-ranking Nazi commander of a death camp and had shared in his sadistic delights). And, finally, the bozos in this column who disliked the music because it had an \\\"Hawaiian sound\\\" must have thought they were listening to Arthur Godfrey on the ukelele rather than Anton Karas' zither. Cold War boilerplate or not: 10 out of 10.\", \"It took me a number of years to see it. Always knew the music, but never took the time to watch it..for some reason or another. Few years ago saw it on a Classic Cable movie channel. I have not stopped watching it since. About a year ago, I BOUGHT THE DVD SPECIAL EDITION..I always find a reason to see it again. And I keep finding more things in it..to make it more rewarding each time. syl.\", \"The fine acting, stunning cinematography, incredible lighting, and remarkable art direction is all accompanied by the numbing, bouncy, unsurpassable zither music. This complex, eerie story is told with cynical narration and shadowy imagery. From the amateur floating in the water, to (spoilers) the balloon seller, whose enormous shadow is thought to be that of Harry lime. The story is almost brutal to the protagonist, the poor sap by the name of Holly Martins who falls into an unhealthy love story.  The final scenes and opening scenes reach perfection. In fact, so do the middle ones. This is is one of the few films that I would never change anything in. From the wry humor to the masterful suspense and dark villains, this will always be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, movies ever made.\", \"The turmoil of post-war Vienna provides the backdrop for the story of \\\"The Third Man\\\" and some exquisite expressionistic cinematography is used to convey the sense of menace and pessimism which prevailed in the city at that time. The plot centres on two men and the way in which their longstanding friendship gradually unravels and finally comes to a fatal conclusion.  Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) is an American author who travels to Vienna to take up the offer of a job working with his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Soon after his arrival he learns that Lime has been killed in an accident and after attending his funeral, intends to return home as soon as possible. He changes his mind, however, when he is invited to speak to the members of a local book club. After a few people provide Martins with information about Lime's accident, he becomes intrigued by some apparent contradictions in their stories and seeks out Lime's girlfriend Anna (Alida Valli). A British military policeman, Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) encourages Martins to leave Vienna and provides him with convincing evidence of the odious nature of the racket in which Lime was involved. Shortly after this, Martins discovers that Lime is actually still alive and meets with him at a local amusement park. Lime invites Martins to join his racket but Martins refuses and later goes on to assist Calloway in capturing his old friend. As a result of this act of betrayal, Anna puts a permanent end to their friendship.  \\\"The Third Man\\\" is an extremely stylish movie in which the sombre, claustrophobic atmosphere of its location is evoked perfectly by use of top class cinematography and a theme tune which fits its purpose far more effectively than any orchestral score could possibly have done. Add to this the great \\\"I never knew the old Vienna\\\" narration, Harry Lime's famous cuckoo clock speech and the drama of Martins' tale of optimism, disillusion, betrayal and loss and you end up with a real classic which continues to have an enduring appeal.\", \"A young American novelist, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton), arrives in Vienna looking for his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Once in the city, however, he learns that Harry Lime has passed away. Shocked, Holly Martins starts asking questions, a lot of them. He is told a number of different stories that eventually lead him to believe that Harry Lime was killed.  Determined to find out who is responsible for Harry Lime's murder, the American embarks on a treacherous journey amidst the unfriendly streets of Vienna. Soon, he is entangled in a web of deceit and dangerous machinations. Along the way, the American also encounters the beautiful Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli), a Czech national with forged Austrian papers, who agrees to help him.  Written by the legendary Graham Greene, Carol Reed's The Third Man is a terrific hybrid of a film where noir, neo-realism and Hollywood bravado are mixed to perfection. Set in post-war Vienna, the film is very much a dark caricature of sorts where the finesse, elegance and tradition of Old Europe are seen through the eyes of a naive but ambitious American looking for his missing friend.  Contrary to what many critics have claimed, the actual story is rather complicated. A giant mystery surrounding Oscar Welles' character, Harry Lime, is slowly peeled off, piece by piece. As a result, The Third Man quickly evolves into a guessing game where every little detail is worth analyzing. As expected for a noir-film, there is also a dangerous femme fatale who becomes a prominent player as soon as the main protagonist reaches Austrian soil.  In addition to strong dark overtones, The Third Man also boasts a great deal of nihilism. Betrayal and impossible love for example are depicted by Carol Reed with a sense of realism that feels uncannily contemporary. Not surprisingly, The Third Man works incredibly well not only as a non-stop adventure film, but also as a realistic depiction of a world struggling to recuperate after an enormous tragedy.  Furthermore, even though The Third Man is a British film, its view on Old Europe is distinctively American. The clash of cultural ideologies, as witnessed through the interactions between Alida Valli and Joseph Cotton, is particularly impressive. There are entire scenes where Carol Reed focuses on the American whose alarming naivety produces some of the most hilarious yet, disturbing sequences that compliment the mystery.  Finally, Anton Karas' soundtrack is beautiful. The mellow sounds produced by his zitner grant The Third Man with an entirely new flavor, one that blends with the dark vistas from Vienna's sewers exceptionally well. Not surprisingly, the atmosphere The Third Man sustains is often cited as its greatest strength.\", \"In a bombed-out Vienna just after WWII, novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives from America to renew a friendship with his childhood buddy, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Much to the dismay of Holly, a freak auto accident has recently killed his friend, according to those who knew Harry.  But in searching for details of Lime's death, Holly gets contradictory stories that don't add up. One of the persons who knew Lime is an attractive woman named Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) whose continued presence in the story invites suspicion. The film's plot has Holly searching for the truth about his friend, while trying to stave off a city detective, Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) who tries to persuade Holly to leave Vienna.  The film's story is okay. But what makes \\\"The Third Man\\\" really interesting is the B&W cinematography, by Robert Krasker. Unlike most films, camera movement here is restricted, so as to draw attention to each frame's geometry. Typically in this film, a frame is tilted at an angle so that both vertical and horizontal points of reference are off-kilter. Frame images thus become a series of diagonal straight lines and curves. Further, very high-contrast lighting, especially in outdoor scenes at night, creates a bizarre, almost nightmarish look and feel, and are suggestive of German Expressionism.  All of which results in a visual disorientation for viewers that parallels Holly's disorientation both in the streets of Vienna and in his understanding of the circumstances surrounding Lime's absence. In most outdoor scenes there's a conspicuous lack of crowds, a lack of hubbub one would expect in a bustling city. Instead, only a few secondary characters appear in night scenes. This sparseness in characters on the streets conveys the impression that hidden eyes are watching Holly, ready to pounce at any moment from out of dark shadows.  \\\"Everybody ought to (be) careful in a city like this\\\", says one character to Holly, as an implied threat. Soon, a man who wants to give Holly some valuable information is murdered.  The script's dialogue is quite impressive, with some interesting lines and points of view. Some of the dialogue is in German, which enhances authenticity.  The film's acting and editing are very, very good. Adding a slightly romantic, and at times melancholy, tone to this dark film is the music of the \\\"zither\\\", an instrument similar to a guitar, but sounding quite different.  My one complaint about this film is that it's hard to keep tabs on some of the background characters. Trying to connect names with faces can be difficult, resulting in some confusion.  \\\"The Third Man\\\" tells an interestingly bleak story, set in a bleak, desolate urban environment, rendered truly mesmerizing by the creatively surreal B&W cinematography.\", \"Story - pretty good.  Cinematographry - amazing!   If you want to enjoy the camera-work, please see this on the Criterion DVD. That's not a plug for the company. It's just that no one else has ever offered a cleaner version of this film. After suffering for years with lousy VHS transfers of this gem, it was nice to see it given justice.  To me, the visuals here make this DVD worth owning because the story is okay, but nothing super. To an average first-time viewer, the first hour of this film can drag. I found that to be the case on my first viewing, but the more I watch this, the better the story seems to have gotten for some reason. Despite his billing, Orson Welles has a small role in here. He doesn't even appear until after 65 of the film's 104 minutes have elapsed. Meanwhile, Joseph Cotten dominates the story, along with Alida Valli, sort of a poor man's Ingrid Bergman. Those two are okay but the story picks up dramatically after Wells finally appears.   In addition to the fabulous cinematography, an unique feature of this movie is the music, which is very strange for a film noir. It's lighthearted music from a zither, almost circus-like in its sound and melody....but I liked it. It helps make this movie different.  The visuals involve a lot of nighttime photography, lots of shadows and cobblestone streets. The tilted camera angles and the closeups - all traits of Wells the director, are here to enjoy\", \"Much like the entrance of Laura in the film LAURA, Harry Lime's entrance into the dark world of post-war Vienna is one of the most unforgettable of all times and effectively erased any memory that Joseph Cotten, the main hero (and alter-ego of Graham Greene) was even in THE THIRD MAN. Photographed under an opening window in a deserted Vienna street, Lime comes into focus as a fleeting face with a smug expression and suddenly we remember Orson Welles was included in the credits. It's a very powerful moment -- one which has us, the viewer, shift our consciousness into wanting to see more of him, wanting to get to know him even if he is a shady, corrupted character. It's the One Moment in the film when it seems that time (in a country that makes clocks, something that Lime makes a joking reference to later on) stops dead in its tracks.  THE THIRD MAN is the one film-noir that doesn't have a treacherous femme fatale and the usual suspects but shady people and a growing sense of doom and despair. That in essence is the very nature of film-noir, where it began before demanding the appearance of a sexy blonde with evil intentions. A political theme and espionage reigns throughout without it ever being as much as hinted at, and betrayal is at every corner, something that Hitchcock would have loved had he directed this film. There is a distant echo of CASABLANCA reflected in the threesome at the center of this story with Anna being the reserved woman in the middle but this is not a lush romance. If anything, there is a strong anti-romantic sentiment here, not only because Anna has been irrevocably separated from Lime but she also will not be the one whom Cotten's Martins gets at the end. And in that sense, that pessimism is what film-noir is about.\", \"The Third Man refers to another witness to a crime that no one seems to know anything about. The crime of course is the hit and run murder of Harry Lime played by Orson Welles. But is Welles dead.  One of the things I like about The Third Man is that it makes a nominal hero out of one of the biggest bunglers ever put on screen. Let's just say that if Holly Martins played by Joseph Cotten were bumping into furniture on top of everything else, he'd be Inspector Clouseau.  Holly arrives in occupied Vienna in the late Forties at the invitation of an old college classmate Harry Lime. Literally upon arriving in Vienna, Martins learns that his friend Lime was the victim of a hit and run accident and the funeral is going on at that moment. He goes to the funeral and is smitten by Lime's girlfriend, Alida Valli.  Martins is a writer of western stories and it's bad when a writer starts believing he's one of his own heroes. Maybe Jessica Fletcher is capable of it, but not Holly Martins. Martins decides to start his own investigation into Lime's death much to the consternation of the British occupying force which doing its own inquiry. Trevor Howard plays Major Callaway of the British Army in charge of the investigation.  Martins turns out to be right that there is something more afoot than a simple traffic accident. But he's so terribly wrong about everything and everyone else it is frightening. I really can't say more at this point.  Someone reading the plot description I've given might think The Third Man is some kind of comedy, but it is not. It is in fact one of the most finely crafted dramas ever put on the screen. The location photography in Vienna is fabulous and contributes so much to the authenticity of the story and its characters. Joseph Cotten gives one of his best performances as the bull-in-the-china-shop amateur detective.  As for Orson Welles, it's a virtual tie in my opinion with Compulsion for the distinction of his finest performer as an actor without working for director Orson Welles. Harry Lime turns out to be the harbinger of a cynical age we were entering.  And if nothing else grabs you about The Third Man, that theme on the zither will stay with you forever. Definitely one of the ten best known movie scores ever.\", \"Carol Reed's \\\"The Third Man\\\" strikes all the right cords, establishing itself on so many different levels that it almost becomes untouchable. It has an underlying tone of darkness that not only thrills but chills. It grabs the viewer from the start and never lets go. It opens with Anton Karas' startling zither music and quickly propels the viewer into a world of evil and lies. The tale is familiar to any film lovers: A pulp Western writer named Holly Martin (Joseph Cotten) is invited to post-war Vienna by an old friend of his, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). The city has been divided into American, British, French and Russian zones. The city exists as a shattered remnant of the past - haunting and horrifying, dark and mysterious. Upon his arrival, Holly discovers to his horror that his old college pal is dead - hit by a car in the middle of a street. But for Holly, the circumstances don't add up - everyone involved in the accident was related in some way or another to Harry. So Holly searches for clues, much to the chagrin of the British officer Calloway (Trevor Howard), whose name is misused as Callohan by Holly many times throughout the film. (\\\"It's 'Calloway,' Mr. Martin, I'm not Irish.\\\") Holly Martin does begin to stumble upon some vital clues as to the real story behind Lime's death - and finds out more than he bargained for. Lime's old girlfriend is a stage actress. (\\\"Always comedy.\\\") She accompanies Holly throughout the film, and we expect an underlying romance to blossom, but yet in the end it does not - one of the many surprises of the film. I suppose it would be a sin for me to give away how Harry Lime reappears, or even give away the fact that he does, for that matter (though by now I am sure you realize Orson Welles is in this movie and therefore turns out to be alive). But for those who have seen the film, we all remember that terrific scene where the cat meows, and suddenly he appears, an evil smirk on his face like a child who has gotten away with the cookie from the jar. And then the ferris wheel scene, and the chase through the sewers that no doubt helped win the film an Oscar for cinematography. These are all some of the most memorable of film scenes. The director of \\\"The Third Man,\\\" Carol Reed, stumbled upon the film's musician, Anton Karas, one night in a trashy bar in Vienna. It is no wonder that out of all his candidates he chose Karas - the film's tune is literally the most perfect example of matching harmony between a film and its music I have ever seen (although \\\"JAWS\\\" is up there with it). To go into the music is pointless - it must simply be heard in synchronism with the film for you to understand where I am coming from. When I think of film noir, \\\"D.O.A.\\\" (1949) and \\\"The Third Man\\\" (1949) are the first two films that come to mind. Both accomplish what they set out to do, but \\\"The Third Man\\\" exceeds even farther than the former - it is haunting and almost poetically vibrant in the way it displays its story and the outcome of its characters. It is a film that will be around for years and years. \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" is often thought of as the greatest American motion picture of all time. But if I had to choose between the two, I would most likely choose \\\"The Third Man.\\\" It's just my opinion, of course, and many may not agree, but as far as I see, \\\"The Third Man\\\" beats \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" - for me - on more levels than one. Welles' \\\"Citizen Kane\\\" (1941) was an artistic film that rarely used close-ups. It would almost stand back from the scenes and let the viewer focus on what he or she wanted to focus on. \\\"The Third Man\\\" has many close-ups. I do not take this as a director trying to give the audience what he wants them to see, but rather a director in touch with his feelings and ideas. Director Carol Reed knows just how to evoke characters' feelings from scenes and close-up shots. The camera tilts at awkward angles more often than not. The more and more paranoid and afraid our hero becomes the more and more intense the close-ups and angles. There is some haunting material in \\\"The Third Man,\\\" some material the most novice of filmgoers might not expect. And the music and direction only makes it all the more terrifying and haunting. This is a film that you must witness to believe. 5/5.\", \"\\\"The Third Man\\\" is a flawless film of intrigue and suspense, a summit of perfection within the genre\\u0085 It is one of the most literate thrillers ever made\\u0085 It is superb1y acted by an ensemble working in an understated, effortless style\\u0085 Its cinematography includes some of the best black-and-white work ever done\\u0085 Its score of haunting zither music is still remembered, instantly familiar to anyone who ever saw the film, and now thorough1y identified with most people's impressions of Vienna\\u0085 Finally, the direction by Carol Reed is exemplary\\u0085 Rarely has a motion picture represented the collaboration of so many exceptional talents... \\\"The Third Man\\\" may be the greatest film made in Britain since World War II\\u0085   The night city terrain of \\\"The Third Man\\\" is unique: occupied postwar Vienna, baroque, bombed-out, decadent, patrolled by Jeeps containing representatives of the four occupying powers, an American, an Englishman, a Frenchman, and a Russian\\u0085  Corrupt, world-weary people hang about its fringes: the overly suave Rumanian, Popescu; the frayed violinist, Baron Kurtz; the atheistic collector of Catholic antiquities, Dr. Winkel; Crabbit, the tired head of the Anglo Cultural Center; and Anna Schmidt, the Czechoslovakian girl friend of Harry Lime, an obscure actress with forged papers\\u0085   Moving among them are three extraordinary principals, Holly Martins, a typical Greene creation; a hack American writer; a used- up second-rater; Colonel Calloway, a Scotland Yard type, chief of British Military Police; and Harry Lime (WeIles), the corrupt two-bit racketeer, a fully immoral, totally unreachable villain\\u0085   These characters wander through rain-slick night streets, in and out of shabby caf\\u00e9s, over the rubble of bombed-out buildings, even into a terrain vague dominated by a huge Ferris wheel\\u0085  The Vienna of \\\"The Third Man\\\" is a vast city that seems empty\\u0085 Its streets are always damp, and water rushes through a system of sweet-smelling sewers underneath\\u0085 It is a world of slinking cats and biting parrots, of people taking advantage of each other without pity\\u0085   \\\"The Third Man\\\" meets the test of complexity\\u0085 The characters interact, their stories conflict: A man who is supposed to be dead turns up alive, there is a question of whether two men or a \\\"third man\\\" carried off Lime's \\\"body,\\\" there are conspiracies, deceits, and double crosses\\u0085   Reed owes debts to Fritz Long for some of his ideas: the geometrical shots, the montage of evidence, Welles' whistling, etc., but Reed has his own original visual style, particularly his use of a slightly tilted camera to produce so-called \\\"Chinese angles,\\\" employed to project danger, foreboding, a twisted universe\\u0085 He is also capable of providing suspense in the tradition of Hitchcock\\u0085   \\\"The Third Man\\\" is unique in the genre for its realism\\u0085 Despite the complexities of plot, the characters are understandable, dimensional, emotionally genuine\\u0097a tribute to the fine ensemble playing and special, low-keyed acting style that is the cinematic equivalent of Graham Greene's writing\\u0085  Carol Reed was knighted for his excellence as a British filmmaker, and for a body of work that is notable for its good taste\\u0085 It is this taste, of course, that works so well in \\\"The Third Man,\\\" but which has destroyed some of his other films, such as \\\"Our Man in Havana,\\\" which require a certain amount of excess to make them work\\u0085\", \"A great deal has been said about \\\"The Third Man\\\" by contributors to this forum. Having seen the restored copy that was shown at the Film Forum, recently, I could not resist watching this masterpiece once more when it was shown by TCM, the other night.  This movie owes a debt of gratitude to Graham Greene, a writer who had the most developed sense of intrigue among his contemporaries and one of the best writers of the last century. It also helped that a great director, Carol Reed, brought it to the screen. Mr. Reed was a director who had an eye for detail, as he demonstrates here, as well as in the rest of the body of work he left for us to enjoy.   The screen play is faithful to the original novel. If to all of the other elements we add the fabulous cinematography of Robert Krasker, the result has to be the masterpiece we see today. Never before has a city taken center stage in the development of the story that is presented here. Mr. Krasker's wonderful night vision of this city enhances the story as we are taken along for a fantastic trip of the post war Vienna of 1949.  The casting of this film is amazing. Never had so many excellent actors been thrown together in a film, as it is the case as with this picture. Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, Trevor Howard, Orson Welles, Bernard Lee, Ernst Deutsch, Paul Horbiger, Erich Ponto and Wilfred Hyde White are splendid in their roles. It is hard to imagine these characters played by other actors.  Orson Welles has perhaps the best part, even though his time before the camera is short. This must have been one of the best roles in which Welles appeared. Of course, there are so many others, but his Harry Lime is an original and could have fitted perfectly in one of his own films.  The music by Anton Karas is still haunting, with the exception of a few times at the beginning of a couple of scenes, when it startles the viewer and actually doesn't add anything to what we are about to see.  This film will live forever.\", \"Post-war Vienna. A dangerous city, full of intrigue, crime & sudden death. Notorious American racketeer Harry Lime starts to cross a street. There is an accident and he is killed instantly. Or is he? His body is carried to the sidewalk by two friends. Or does another man assist them? If so, who is THE THIRD MAN and what does he know about Lime's suspicious death?  Such is the puzzle at the beginning of what many consider to be the greatest film ever made. Its glories are so obvious that it is almost futile to pick out any for observation: the marvelous sewer chase, the balloon man, the little boy with the ball, the giant wheel, the cuckoo clock speech & the long closing walk across the cemetery. All of these linger in the mind, becoming permanent residents of our cinematic subconscious.  The entire cast is excellent: Joseph Cotton as Lime's American friend trying to piece together what has happened; Trevor Howard as the stalwart British Major of Police; gorgeous Valli as Harry's faithful lover; Bernard Lee as the tragic Police Sergeant; Wilfrid Hyde-White as a dithering English cultural attach\\u00e9. And then there's Orson Welles...  The character of Harry Lime, alive or dead, on-screen or not, is one of cinema's most fascinating villains. Charming & deadly as any cobra, he attracts & repels at the same moment. It is interesting to note that BBC Radio resurrected the character for the series 'The Lives of Harry Lime' very shortly after the film's release. Harry was not allowed to stay in his grave for long...  Three more items of note: (1) The cinematography is first-rate, making Vienna by night look almost lunar. (2) Orson Welles' first appearance on screen is a real dandy. (3) Above & around & through everything is the famous zither music of Anton Karas, which becomes like a Greek Chorus, commenting on the action. Its complete silence during the sewer chase only underscores the starkness of the sequence.\", \"\\\"I never knew the Old Vienna, before the war, with its Strauss Music,\\\" opens Carol Reed's The Third Man, and we catch a glimpse of the New Vienna, with its Black Market and its Shady Deals. Joseph Cotten plays cheap novelette author Holly Martins, just arrived in Vienna to meet with long-time friend Harry Lime, who offered him a job. He instead meets with the mysterious facts surrounding the death of Lime, learned bit-by-bit from Lime's friends, a woman named Anna Schmidt, who has problems of her own (played excellently by Valli), and two British officers, Calloway and Paine. Learning, that there is more to death of Lime than there seems to be, Martins begins his investigation for the truth. This film was shot with some of the greatest, most ahead-of-its-time cinematography ever, and it creates mystery and deceit. It is complimented by the excellent use of shadows. The soundtrack is essentially one long song, which plays throughout the film, changing and stopping as the emotion calls for. It is a zither composition by Anton Karas made for the film. This is all topped off by an engrossing storyline, and a great performance by Joseph Cotten, as the ordinary man mixed up in this web of mystery.\", \"The Third Man is a movie that looks and feels not like a movie of the 40s, but like a neo-noir of the late 60s/early 70s. This wonderful example of classic noir is one of the all time greatest films. It combines amazing visuals, sounds, dialogue, and acting to tell a thrilling story and comment about the atmosphere after WWII.  Of all the movies durring the studio era (pre-1960ish), there are three movies with cinematography that always stick out in my mind: Gregg Toland's work in Citizen Kane, Russel Mety's work in Touch of Evil, and Robert Krasker's work in The Third Man (all starring Orson Welles funny enough). I just recently saw a restored 35mm version of The Third Man. The crisp black and white visuals of a bombed out Vienna are so breath-taking. Shadows are everywhere. The unique way Krasker tilts the camera in some shots adding to the disorientation of the plot. And who can forget the first close-up of Welles with the light from an apartment room above splashing onto his face; one of the great entrances in movie history (Lime gives his old friend a smile that only Welles could give).  The cinematography is backed by strong performances by Welles, Cotten, and italian actress Vali. The writing of Greene is wonderful; you can see the plot twisting around Cotten tightly. But what makes The Third Man so great is its historical commentary (well not really historical since it was commenting on its own time, but to us it is historical). On one level The Third Man is a story of betrayal and corruption in a post-war, occupied Vienna. On the other hand, its giving the audience a glimpse of the mood of Europe after the great war. The uncertainty that the Cold War was bringing is evident through out the film; Cotten is constantly trying to figure out who to trust. Vienna is on the frontier of the new communist bloc (we even see the communists infiltrating Vienna trying to bring Vali back to her native Czechoslavakia). The zither music score combined with the stark images of bombed out Vienna are reminiscent of the frontier towns of American Westerns.

The movie is in two parts, the first being about a quest for paradise and the second one being about the price of paradise. And while the first one is good, it is the second one which makes this movie worth seeing. It was made by the usual Danny Boyle-John Hodge team, but someone is missing: Ewan McGregor. McGregor would have been perfect as Richard, but instead, it is Leonardo DiCaprio who got the role. While DiCaprio is not a bad actor, he is not a good one either. He can't ruin a movie by himself, but he can't make it better. He is okay as Richard, and in the second half of the movie he is even good, but he still lacks charisma. And that lack of charisma is made even more evident in the scenes between him and Robert Carlyle, which gives an awesome performance in a small role. When both actors are on screen, DiCaprio disappears. Virginie Ledoyen was chosen because she is absolutely gorgeous, not because of her acting talent. Her performance as Fran\\u00e7oise is barely okay. The rest of the cast is good. Tilda Swinton shows the obsession of her character very well. There is, as in any Boyle movie, an excellent soundtrack which includes such artists as Moby, Blur, The Chemical Brothers, UNKLE, Asian Dub Foundation, Underworld and New Order. Sadly, there is also a song by All Saints(another proof that this is Danny Boyle's most commercial movie yet). The photography is Oscar-worthy. As I said earlier, the second part of the movie is the best one. Also, the love story is not very well done and too predictable. But despite some flaws, this is still an interesting movie. I also believe it is better to have already seen Shallow Grave before seeing this one, as it tackles similar themes shown in a very different way. It is fun to see how Boyle includes them in is most commercial movie yet(and hopefully, ever).  77%\", \"Some thoughts (for whatever they are worth)-    - The Beach has several Trainspotting-like moments of inspired glee mixed within the overall darker elements of the story (Richard's dark dementia broken up with a little goofy video game bit, for example). It just doesn't seem to work as smoothly and perfectly as Trainspotting, altho The Beach isn't *that* bad a flick.   - One thing another poster mentions is the Beautiful People mold that the Beach inhabitants seem to have been mass produced from. While there is a false sense of glamour and youth in the casting of thin/young/beautiful people, maybe that lends itself as a stark contrast to the very dire circumstances and consequences of their actions. These people are attractive and young and hip, yet they are proven to be ultimately silly and frivolous when faced with the reality of their actions. Well, maybe not - but it makes me feel better to think that, either way ;).  \", \"**********THE BEACH**********  The Plot: Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young American backpacker, is willing to risk his life for just one thing: that mind-blowing rush you can only get from braving the ultimate adventure. But on a secret, deceptively perfect beach, he'll soon discover that, as the level of intensity rises and the stakes climb higher, desire grows stronger...and danger grows deeper. 73%  The Acting: Leonardo DiCaprio pulls off another winner, his performance is electrifying and powerful. Newcomers Virgine Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet also put in amazing efforts for their debut feature films. Tilda Swinton and Robert Carlyle are among the more known people of this movie, and they are ultimately impressive. 79%  The Screenplay/Directing: John Hodge, who directed Trainspotting, has obviously decided to take a turn for writing. His screenplay is well-adapted from Alex Gardland's novel, and although it weakens near the end, he still keeps you wrapped up in all the brilliantly confusing plot twists. Danny Boyle, director, went to amazing hights to make this film successful, and he deserves praise. 80%  Other: Some chilling sound and mind-blowing cinematography. 70%  Overall: The Beach is an interesting, intriguing and different film, and although it is as times deeply flawed, it is still an immensly powerful and watchable film. Recommended. 74%  **********THE BEACH 74%**********  \", \"First, i\\u00b4m not Leo`s fun. I think he is one of very talented young actors, but after Titanic had no chance to prove it. Earlier i saw the movie, only after that i have red the book. What i like in this movie is that everytime i watch it i feel like Richard. It could be so funny to escape of civilization, find your own paradise island and live there until the end of my life /but only with a girl like francoise/. I also love exteriors of this movie, great work of camera, absolutely perfect soundtrack and acting of some of the actors/Robert Carlyle, Tilda Swinton - she is exactly as Sal in the book/. My dislike of this movie is that it doesn\\u00b4t know what it want to say. Is it lookin\\u00b4for a real life ? Or to show how interests of group are more than life of its member ? Eight stars is very much, but six for movie and two for beauty of Thailand and Virginie Ledoyen sounds better. You should certainly see it and make your own opinion.\", \"Fair enough this film has superb scenery, a great plot, and decent actors, however I cannot help but to be disappointed with the adaption. It is in Boyle's style but it isn't suited to the film, if you have read the book then I'm sure you will agree that it could have been much better - the viewer should watch the film and then fail to understand how they could ever leave such a place. Too much time is concentrated on Daffy and Richard following his path, unlike in the novel. Also, I think it is appropriate to mention here that it is left open nicely to either a sequel or prequel. This film could have been an epic!\", \"Although this film has been trashed terribly, there are some of us who actually really liked this film.  Maybe it's the traveller in me, but this film about the search to find, and create the ultimate paradise, is actually quite affecting. From personal experience, I find the colony of backpackers that live in the Beach community to be very realistic. I've met these people! Di Caprio is actually quite good as a frat boy kind of American and Swinton is great as the community's dictatorial leader.  Don't see this film expecting a repeat of the book. Few films are as good as the book, we all know that. But for those of you with a traveller's heart and for those of you who dream of finding the perfect paradise, I'd say this film is an exotic and refreshing and worth your time.  Sure there are some parts, like the video-game sequence where Richard goes all Lord of the Flies that is a bit ridiculous. But all in all, it's escapist and rather sad and examines the downfall of a paradise.  \", \"Although this movie received a lot of negative press, I was pleased to have seen it. The plot, as with the book, is in my opinion a little dull but the acting I thought was great. Di Caprio and Carlisle can always be expected to do wonders with any part they play. Although I have watched the movie several times, I will be adding it to my DVD collection.\", \"DiCaprio fever seems to have obscured the worth of this film on its own merits. His celebrity seems to have overshadowed and killed serious criticism of this film, I believe. If \\\"Lord of the Flies\\\" is seen as a reference, I think a case can be made that this film makes some very powerful and effective statements about classic Utopianism among the children of the jaded and bored richer classes. DiCaprio plays his spoiled American very well. The young man is a great actor. The role of Tilda Swinton is well written, but I think she made her character too intelligent and complex with her excellent, but intense, acting. The jockish and superficial tribe members were much more convincing. I loved the international casting. The cast and the setting are visual knock outs. Robert Carlyle brought his \\\"Trainspotting\\\" insanity to the film, but I think his character was written over the top. Paterson Joseph, as Keaty, was a stand out. Guillame Canet, as Etienne, worked well as the tortured cast off in his particular love triangle. It took two viewings of this film for me to see past its stunning visuals and over-the-top highs and lows to appreciate it for its intelligent themes. If you disliked it the first time, you might give it another try.\", \"Well just seen it for the 3rd time DVD format. I like this movie a lot, the plot is great, the weirdness admires me and i love the ending. The other seens cut for the movie for time reasons are great and should have been there, no problem if the movie was to be some 30 minutes long.\", \"I thought the movie was quite good, capturing the high of being young in big bad wonderful world. The acting was believable enough for me, and also I thought the use of pop (and not so pop) music was done well. As for content, The Beach raises deep issues on how we deal with our own existence, experience, sanity and commitments to other people: there did seem to be more noble purpose than just speculating in the emotions of the viewer. Although many find fault with the film, I think - at very least - it deserves credit for the choice of material, and credit for having brought this material to fruition in the form of a Hollywood movie.\", \"I have not read the novel that this screenplay is based on, so I cannot comment on that respect.  As a film in it's own right, the direction was rather interesting. Pop culture was left behind for an alternative culture. But then, at what point does alternative culture become popular? This is much the same with alternative musics/culture today. Perhaps, the spiral into savagery and madness could have been more dark.  The cinematography was breathtaking and the soundtrack well selected for the above mentioned theme. One criticism is that the direction seemed to almost flagrantly look 'arthouse'.  7 out of 10. Less if you have read the novel.\", \"This is one of the few times that I have been badly mislead by the reviews on IMDb! I avoided this film in the past because of this, but thought it would be a good \\\"soft\\\" film to watch on video with with a friend and his wife (she doesn't like difficult films).  What a revelation! I understand that people who have read the book may be disappointed, but as an uneducated viewer this is a fantastic film! Novel situation, novel location (beautiful images, even though the beach was re-modeled), novel plot, novel characters (all of whom are wildly different yet possible to sympathise with - except maybe for Bugs)... this film has everything in it that I find so desperately lacking in the average Hollywood pulp I'm forced to watch with friends.  And I *liked* the fact that the film made a few surprising changes in style... I hate knowing the end of a story at least an hour before it finally grinds its inevitable way there (see any \\\"action\\\" film).\", \"Critics didn't like this film. Roger Ebert, whose reviews I generally find insightful and on target, gave it just 2 stars and called it \\\"seriously confused\\\". On the IMDB hit parade, it only rates about 6 stars. Because of this, I didn't go and see it at the theatre, and have been ambivalent about renting the video, even though I like DiCaprio's work, and admired Danny Boyle's previous \\\"Trainspotting\\\". Then my teenage daughter came home from a party where she and her friends had watched it, and she said, \\\"It's brilliant! You HAVE to see it, Mum!\\\"  So, we rented the video, and I'm glad we did. The Beach is an interesting and solid film that tells an intriguing, if somewhat episodic, story in a stylish way. DiCaprio is, indeed, excellent as a young man searching for life's ultimate experiences, and getting more than he bargained for. This is a loss-of-innocence story, a sort of cross between Lord of the Flies, Apocalypse Now, and the musical The Fantastics. Director Danny Boyle leads us on Richard's journey to the Heart of Darkness in an energetic, stylish way--filming is interesting and beautiful--and he gets excellent results from his actors. The use of Richard's voice-over as narrative--often a distraction in films--here offers a certain amount of adolescent profundity and acuteness of observation, and it works.  I've been a traveller in Thailand. Although Richard's quest and Richard's scene wasn't mine, I've seen it...the beaches, the bars, the snake blood, the dope, the parties. I've also been a high school teacher, and have worked with adolescents hungry to discover \\\"the real world\\\", to bite into Eve's apple with gusto. Many from New Zealand head off in their late teens/early twenties on \\\"The Great OE\\\" (Overseas Experience). The same is undoubtedly true for many Australians and Brits, if not so commonly for American youth. So there's a strong element of \\\"truth\\\" in this story.  Don't listen to the critics. This is a good, solid film with an interesting perceptive story, fine performances, and a stylish presentation. Four stars out of five.\", \"This movie is not considered to be really worth watching, but I disagree. It does have some parts that don't really work, and a couple of bad actors. It had the potential to be really excellent. The story is really unique, and intriguing. It's also quite scary - especially the start, in the scene with Daffy. It also had really good effects - the computer game bit freaked me out. Leonardo DiCaprio did a pretty good job in it. Especially in the part where he has to retrieve the map. Everyone will hate Sal, which means she's a good actress, because you're supposed to hate her. Overall it's a pretty good movie, and you should see it.\", \"Brilliant!...Leonardo pulled off a stunning performance. A really good, mixture of category's, horror, mystery, drama, adventure... Although It was not too realistic at times. Good acting, good story, and a good setting. It was a real paradise, It made me want to stay in my seat and I could not move!  But like all movie stars after one big film hit they get a funky haircut, put some glasses on and go shopping for clothes in the second hand store. This is what Leon' done... He now looks like Daffy duck with plastic surgery. Theres always one explanation: to get into a magazine!  Although, this isnt the first crazy trend he's tried to start, he really did confuse me in the Beach, I liked him in Titanic better. But still a stunning performance in the Beach.\\\\4****star rating/\", \"Has anyone actually paid to see this movie? whether in the theater or renting the movie? I caught it channel surfing one night and paused only long enough to figure out what I was watching and recall why I hate Leo. The only reason I am even wasting my time to write a review is because someone needs to counter the endless stream of 9s and 10s on this sight. If you ask me, this only degrades the quality of IMDb.  As for the reality, it is not even close. I spent two years in the tropics and life is very hard. You are sunburnt all the time, not tan, and sick from the monotony of the food, tropical diseases and storms. ***Spoiler follows*** watching Leo spear a dozen fish on his first try followed by a macho, \\\"I provide!\\\" moved something within me that I didn't know existed :{D= ***End of Spoiler***  What else is on!\", \"Once again, Hollywood has managed to lower the benchmark for a bad movie even further. This was such a bad movie that I felt myself constantly looking at my watch. I didn't even have to pay for it - but I still felt as though I had wasted 2 hours of my life.  The plot was terrible, and was so over the place that sometimes it just wasn't clear what was happening. The character development was non-existent. It was not clear why the characters did what they did and why they had become what they were.   **** Little spoiler ahead****  And when Leo went \\\"wild\\\", I was totally confused. Why? How? He just sudden;y turned into a savage and started running around the forest making traps and eating bugs. Plus the flash backs to the guy who gave him the map - were they dreams? Drug induced? Or did he have some tropical fever??????  The whole thing was so unrealistic that is was just pathetic. Leo can act, but it seems that all the budget was spent on him, and that they just pulled some backpackers off the street of Bangcok and said \\\"Do you wanna be in a movie?\\\". The only redeeming thing about this film was that the cinematograpgy was pretty good.  ****Spolier ahead!*****  Another thing that bothered me was the shark scene. I'm sorry, but a whole lagoon would NOT fill up with blood if a shark attacked 2 or 3 people. Plus the shark itself was HORRIBLE! I haven't seen such a bad shark for ages!! The whole theatre laughed!!! It looked like a piece of painted foam. They should have borrowed the \\\"Jaws\\\" set from Universal or something.  This movie was so bad that it is not ever worth seeing. It was like MTV meets \\\"Lord of the Flies\\\" meets \\\"Apocolypse Now\\\" - taking the worst elements of each. You'd be better off using 2 hours of your life in any other way.\", \"Entertaining in parts, but as a whole it's pure manure.  This movie is generally about the sociopath Richard( DiCaprio),in his elitist pursuit of pleasure, sex and holiday paradise. He goes to great length in pursuing this, using lies, deceit and violence to get what he wants. He gets to know about a secluded Thai beach, and makes friends with a french guy and his girlfriend in order to steal the girlfriend from the guy.. The trio finds their \\\"paradise\\\" on an island that's part occupied by some armed and crazy Thai marijuana farmers, and the other part; a crazy hippie collective . The hippies are driven by a collective fear of getting their tropical paradise discovered, so they use fascistic methods when silencing members of the society to not reveal the secrets of the whereabouts of their beautiful beach/self made tropical paradise \\\"community\\\".  The hippie commune, is still a slave to consumerism society, and not the alternative society that it is set out to be. Just like Richard, the members of the community goes to great length in defending their right to \\\"fun\\\" and \\\"pleasure\\\", taking a blind fold to the ones that get hurt and killed in their pursuit. The goal of the commune is elitist and fascist, the means of using violence is motivated by keeping out other tourists and people the commune doesn't want out of this beach-resort. Richard makes everything he can to do the same things. He is everything that goes bad with the commune inpersonated.. He's not able to feel any empathy or understanding for anyone, the only time he openly questions the fascism of the commune is when his own life is on the line in order to save it. In other cases he walks away, and still \\\"feels good being in paradise\\\".   Well the movies meaning wasn't supposed to be about this. The director somehow thought that we should see any kind of sympathy and actually care about what happens to Richard, and forgive him for his actions, instead he is the only guy in this movie that is actually disgustingly inhumane. Maybe he thought we should have been blazed by the star quality of Di Caprio. But truthfully, He is nothing more than a stupid parody of idiotic travellers who think they can behave anyhow they like in any foreign exotic location. The unintentional satire is exaggerating this, making him a total psychopath. He is not just a someone who quietly takes orders, the nazi-like leader of the commune; Sal is his peer. The same person, but with power.  DiCaprios character is somebody you would want the director to have shot off early in the movie. Even if it was the meaning of the director to show DiCaprio as a total a-hole, this a-hole definitely isn't good company for the two hours. This is not the only bad thing about the movie. It's slow scenes, extremely bad computer animations and the horribly outdated brit-pop soundtrack makes it an equally painful experience to watch.  The movies ending is nothing but Richard being nostalgic about his beach adventures in his normal-life setting, not having learned any lesson or gained any emotional strength. The viewer is also encouraged to join his nostalgia for his blood stained paradise.   Why go to such great lengths anyway to get away from the mass tourists? Go to the Philipines or any place that isn't as crowded as Thailand. Stupid movie.\", \"Ever since (at least) the eighteenth century, with its cult of the \\\"noble savage\\\", tropical islands have frequently been seen in Western culture as the nearest that it is possible to come to Paradise on earth. This view is often reflected in the cinema, in films such as \\\"The Blue Lagoon\\\" or the various versions of \\\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\\", in which the idyll of Tahiti is contrasted with the rigours of life on board a British warship. The two versions of \\\"Lord of the Flies\\\", like the William Golding novel on which they are based, offer an ironic twist on this theme; a tropical island is used as the setting for an anti-Utopian story in which an attempt to found a new society ends in a relapse into barbarism.  \\\"The Beach\\\" has certain similarities to \\\"Lord of the Flies\\\". The main character is Richard, an American backpacker travelling round Thailand, who has heard tales of a co-operative multi-national community of idealistic young people living on a beach on an island off the coast. Richard has dismissed these tales as mere urban legends, but changes his mind when another backpacker, Daffy, gives him a map showing where the mysterious beach can be found. Undeterred by the fact that Daffy commits suicide shortly afterwards, Richard sets out to go there accompanied by Etienne and Francoise, a young French couple whom he has befriended.  After a number of adventures, the three succeed in reaching the island and discover that the fabled community is no urban myth but a reality. At first they are welcomed into the group and spend their days leading a seemingly idyllic lifestyle, consisting of a small amount of time spent in fishing and large amounts of time spent in playing volleyball or beach cricket, lazing about smoking pot, or (for some obscure reason) translating various English phrases into Serbo-Croat. As with all films of this type, however, we quickly realise that this life is less perfect than it seems. Sexual tensions arise when Richard finds himself increasingly attracted to Francoise and she deserts her boyfriend Etienne for him. More seriously, there are flaws in the basic concept of the community.  The main flaw is that travel narrows the mind wonderfully. The community, mostly Westerners, have dropped out of their own societies and travelled halfway around the world to Thailand, but find Thai society no more congenial than those they have left behind. Their solution is to drop out of that too and to set up a \\\"beach resort for people who don't like beach resorts\\\" where they can live their own hedonistic idea of the hippie life. The community is not, however self-sufficient; they produce little for themselves, apart from fish, and have to import many of their supplies from the mainland, which they pay for by growing and selling cannabis. The island, in fact, is owned by a group of Thai farmers, themselves involved in a much larger cannabis-producing operation, who are happy to tolerate the newcomers provided they keep their community a secret and do not try to attract new recruits.  As in many anti-Utopian parables, the community is dominated by a sinister dictator-figure. \\\"Lord of the Flies\\\" had the choirboy Jack, \\\"Animal Farm\\\" had Napoleon and \\\"The Beach\\\" has Sal, an upper-class Englishwoman who is accepted as the leader of the community (although it is never clear how she attained this position). Sal is obsessed with protecting the community's privacy and secrecy, and in order to achieve this end she is prepared to resort to violence, even murderous violence. (She is deeply suspicious of Richard, who she suspects may have distributed further copies of Daffy's map). One of the film's most chilling incidents comes after Christo, one of the group, is seriously injured after being attack by a shark. He can only be saved if he is taken back to the mainland for immediate medical treatment, but because this might result in the community's existence being revealed to outsiders, Sal refuses to permit this and Christo is left to die.  There is some good acting in the film, especially from Tilda Swinton who gives a nicely judged performance as Sal, a woman with steely eyes and a cut-glass accent who for most of the movie can seem threatening without ever issuing any direct threats or even raising her voice. This increases the impact of the scene at the end where Sal finally does lose her cool. The beautiful Virginie Ledoyen makes a charming and unaffected Francoise, and I also liked Guillaume Canet as Etienne. Originally seen as a loser, the man who loses his girlfriend to Richard, Etienne later emerges as the community's voice of conscience, the one man who refuses to abandon the dying Christo.  It was, however, unfortunate that the director Danny Boyle, who wanted Ewan McGregor to play Richard, was overruled by the studio, as Leonardo di Caprio, although he is better here than he was in \\\"Titanic\\\", tends to overact. The film tends to deteriorate in the second half, with the plot becoming difficult to follow as Richard, alienated from his fellow-members of the group, starts to become mentally unstable. The style of direction was excessively hectic for my tastes, and the sequence where Richard imagines he is a character in a video game was particularly eccentric. Despite its potentially interesting themes, \\\"The Beach\\\" falls just short of being a very good film. 7/10\", \":Trust Me, Its Paradise  'The Beach' is a kinda of movie the feel of which surrounds you slowly and completely.  I'd say Danny Boyle has done complete justification to the book. The movie captures the essence of the book. I watched the movie first and then read the book. The beach can be better experienced thru the movie. The music (by Angelo Badalamenti) is excellent, but unfortunately not popular( which is why I believe popular is not always the best ;-)). DiCaprio proves how versatile and powerful he is as an actor. A must watch for DiCaprio fans. Purchase an original DVD and you'll get to see alternate beginning and alternate climax of the movie with director's comments. You will like this movie especially if you are a crazy traveler and like to explore unseen and untouched places.  Direction, location, music and DiCaprio are the strengths of the movie. 'The Beach' is not just a movie, its an experience.  :never refuse an invitation, never resist the unfamiliar. Just keep your mind open and suck in the experience........\", \"Well - Where do I start... A classic story written by Alex Garland - Destroyed by Danny Boyle & co. It would take a long time to pick my way through the debris of this particular shambles so I shall narrow it down to what I see as the main critical flaws that sank Leo's latest water borne epic 1. The movie has been aimed squarely at a teen market hence you get style over content - The beautiful people in paradise hanging out with a highly commercial soundtrack and a Top Shop tie in on the fashion side  2. The removal of the deep cynicism evident in Garlands novel - Read the book - you will find it very hard to find a sympathetic character.  3. Richards(Leo) fascination with the whole 'Nam pop culture - this is throw in as an afterthought in the last 25 minutes of the film(apart from a fleeting glimpse of Apocalypse Now in the opening reel)and falls completely flat - what we get is comical( check out Leo as he does his best Cat. Willard impressions - hilarious!  4. The love interest. Okay - this I can understand purely for its commercial reasons - it has a bums on seats factor. But it damages a vital part of the book - Richard never gets it together with Francois let alone Sal hence there is an unspoken tension in the air which adds to Richards isolation and his descent into 'Nam paranoia. Enough! If you want the real experience read the book - if you want a very cheap facsimile go see Leo and the gang...3/10  \", \"In the beginning of 2000, everyone waited impatiently, the release of the movie \\\"the beach\\\", mainly because Leonardo DiCaprio was in the main role. You thought that he was going to carry on with dignity, following the huge commercial and artistic success of \\\"Titanic\\\". But sadly, it's not the case. This movie that is a new variation of the lost paradise is a disappointment.   As far as I'm concerned, I saw the movie at the cinema when it was launched in February 2000 and I thought that it would focus only on DiCaprio, Ledoyen and Canet's efforts to discover this beach. Actually, my expectation was justified but it only lasts half an hour. When they discover the beach and they adhere to the community, I think the movie could have ended there. The second part (which starts with the three Swedish bitten by a shark) only plays the role of fill-in and spoils all the movie. Moreover, Danny Boyle eyes a bit too much towards the bloody.  Otherwise, to put it mildly is that the dialogs of \\\"the beach\\\" are few inspired sometimes silly and too convenient with the situations. Sometimes, the movie turns out to be too predictable: before the love affair between DiCaprio and Ledoyen, you guess that a love story will start between them. And, inevitably, it will cause Canet's jealousy but this jealousy will spread to Ledoyen she learns that DiCaprio had sex with Sal during their stay in Bangkok. Besides, the performance appears quite mixed: Ledoyen and Canet are paling into insignifiance next to DiCaprio. Another thing I noticed: DiCaprio' voice-off doesn't succeed in making the movie gripping as it was the case with Edward Norton in \\\"Fight Club\\\".  Then, let's admit it: the end of the movie seems too easy and conventional. You guess before the end that the perfect paradise doesn't exist on earth and certainly not in Thailand: there are sharks, it's not always shiny and Sal, the leader of the community reveals herself to be despotic and finally cruel. Let's add that the \\\"paradise keepers\\\" will do anything to protect their territory, even to kill...  Nevertheless, the movie enjoys a shiny photography that reflects brilliantly the color of the sea and the beach. Landscapes are magnificient and there's a good original soundtrack which includes Moby's porcelain. But these qualities aren't sufficient enough to save the movie. A disappointing and predictable movie and somewhere unfinished. You can blame Boyle for not revealing the reasons of Daffy's suicide.\", \"Ah backpacking across the world . What an exciting thing it is - but only if you're a rare and remarkable person . Travelling all over the world isn't all it's cracked up to be . You might get a one night stand , you might get stoned but to be honest couldn't you have got that at home ? Did you really need to go the ends of the earth for that ? If you're a rare remarkable person you'll also get altitude sickness , suffer dysentery , catch ringworm and under go a rabies scare . You'll have wasted all your money on plane tickets and inoculations and the only thing you'll have to show for it is a small paragraph in the obituary column of the local newspaper after dying from a rare tropical disease   THE BEACH is very similar in many ways . It's based on a well regarded novel by Alex Garland , features Leonardo Dicaprio a megastar after his role in TITANIC and is directed by Danny Boyle one of Britain's greatest living directors and yet it's a film that is difficult to enjoy and it's easy to explain why - characterisation   Take one American pretty boy , send him in Thailand , stick him on an island with a bunch of selfish , unsympathetic people and watch a potentially good film fall apart . Did anyone like the characters in this movie ? Neither did I . I haven't read Garland's novel but I'm led to believe there's a scene where a giant squid is washed up on the beach and the characters eat it only to end up with food poisoning . I would have enjoyed this movie much more if all the characters had died from food poisoning . When you watch a movie and the most likable character is a mad mental foul mouthed dope smoking Scotsman then you know the producers have got a problem   Another thing I had problems with is the way Leonardo Dicaprio's character Richard suddenly turns from inquisitive backpacker into Colonel Kurtz . Something similar happens in another Boyle movie 28 DAYS LATER but at least in that movie you're aware of the character's motive even if it is fairly unconvincing . Here you do find yourself wondering the explanation ended up on the cutting room floor or even if it was excluded at draft stage . Not only that but you find that the characters remain unchanged by events at the end therefore there is zero character development   Danny Boyle has said that he makes quintessential British films and it's difficult to disagree with him . TRAINSPOTTING has a strong feel of time and place while 28 DAYS LATER mirrors the British apocalypse writers of the 1950s . THE BEACH with its exotic foreign location and its American star definitely feels like it's made for an American audience and Boyle tries too hard to pander to their taste . That's why THE BEACH is probably Boyle's weakest film to date\", \"I'll be brief. I didn't want to watch 'The Beach' because of the bad reviews, but when I accidentally came across it while surfing through the channels, I couldn't stop watching.  If you're young and have a thing for interesting stories, you'll love this one.  10/10\", \"Danny Boyle did an exquisite job on this film. When I first learned that it was indeed a Danny Boyle film I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have any of his \\\"original\\\" cast members... the people that he always works with. When I learned that Robert Carlyle was in this, I was ecstatic. This film has so many wonderful points, I can't list them all. I'm just going to say that \\\"enjoy your dinner Richard\\\" was a classic cinematic moment. A great thing about this film is that it's a wonderful representation of a microcosm of todays society. It shows that no matter how hard you try to escape all the wrongs in life, and all of your daily annoyances, they'll still be there no matter where you escape to. This film doesn't go from beginning to end. It circles. There is no ending because their lives didn't end. Truly a supreme film. It is what one should expect from a man like Danny Boyle. Leonardo DiCaprio gives another amazing performance. It takes a wonderful actor to be able to portray an emotion such as insanity just with his eyes, and he did so wonderfully!\", \"The first time I saw this film, I completely despised it. After seeing Danny Boyle's masterpiece, Trainspotting (1996) and reading the source novel (by Alex Garland), I decided to give it another chance. A second viewing was a good idea. By no means is this a masterpiece, but it's not the bomb it's made out to be either. The dialogue is the most damaging aspect, and it is undoubtedly weak. However, the story is compelling and the leading man (Leonardo DiCaprio) is as brilliant as ever.  The Beach is about an American explorer named Richard (DiCaprio). He is a hedonist, an outsider, and a fun-loving kind of guy. When he hears about a secret island paradise from a strange Scottish madman, he jumps on the opportunity to go there. He invites a French couple he has met in his travels, with the possible hope of getting somewhere romantically with the woman.  This is vastly different from the Richard that Alex Garland wrote in the source material. Garland's Richard is a polite, borderline selfless British traveler with dark hair. In other words, he's the polar opposite of Leonardo DiCaprio's self-involved adulterer. This isn't a drawback. Too many people draw novel-to-film comparisons, when the two mediums are far too different to be doing so. The Beach is a brilliant novel, and justifiably a cult classic. The film adaptation is compelling in its own respect.  The introduction is marvelous \\u0096 a frenzied, gorgeously shot exploration of Bangkok on New Year's Eve, accompanied by Richard's introductory narration. Leonardo DiCaprio is the master of voice-overs, and The Beach is no exception. He captures the enthusiasm and wonderment of this character perfectly, and his voice is as interesting and expressive as any great piece of music.  When the opening titles are complete, we are under the impression that we're in for something great. The relationship between Richard and his new-found friends (the French couple) is very badly written, and a lot of the dialogue comes across awkwardly. The meat of this film is heavily flawed, as John Hodge didn't quite seem to know how to structure the story.  The weak second act builds up to a conclusion that's as strong as the introduction. Richard is overcome by an addiction to compulsive lies, and he is eventually forced into isolation. His mind has been twisted as a result of his obsession with video games and Vietnam War films, and he begins to lose his mind. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is the most riveting here\\u0085 after the heroic artist he played in Titanic (1997), it's surprising to witness his portrait of this pot-smoking brat.  Although the script overall is the weakest link here, Richard is an intriguing character. He is completely immersed in the bliss of his own world, and he is seemingly ignorant to the effect he has on others. He likes smoking lots of weed, playing lots of Game Boy, and pretending that problems don't exist. Only an actor as talented as DiCaprio could keep us interested in this man.  Thanks to the outstanding lead and Danny Boyle's directorial finesse, this movie ends up being a fascinating mess. The soundtrack is memorable, the photography is beautiful, and some of the vaguely examined themes are chilling. This should have been a masterpiece, but the screenplay is lacking where many of the other elements are not. I would certainly recommend watching it with an open mind, but it's far from a great film.\", \"Here is another of those films that got panned by critics all over the place, but I liked the movie and thought it was unfairly criticized.  Two things are not up for debate: the film is entertaining and the cinematography is gorgeous.  Leonardo DiCaprio's lead character is not particularly likable, but that's nothing new for him. He's good at playing the boyish, cocky immature type. He's also good at narration, which he provides here, as he has in a number of other films. In fact, I wish there were more of it in here.  French actress Virginie Ledoyen is a new face to me, and a pretty one. I found her intriguing, and not just because of her face Actually, all the characters were pretty darn interesting in this film and you get a varied group.  The scenery from Thailand is magnificent. By the way, \\\"the beach\\\" that's in this film really exists, just as it's seen here. The story is interesting, too, for the full two hours. My only complaint was that they might have toned down the language, particularly with all the f-words.  Don't listen to those national critics who blasted this. I think you'll be entertained.\", \"I went to this one, knowing that it could be crap, but hey, I do not care what others think and once again this way of thinking did not prove me wrong.  This flick is basically about a young twenty who goes away on a trip to Thailand by himself, because he wants to forget his past. There he meets a loony (Robert Carlyle) who gives him a map to a secret paradise. He asks two strangers, Fran\\u00e7oise (Virginie Ledoyen who was really great in her first big American Film and good looking too by the way) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) to come and join them.  After they have found the island they meet an alternative group who lives there and they join them, but after a while problems evolve and a minor 'hell' breaks loose.  This is the plain story-line of the movie, but there is so much more to it, it has a message and that really is what fascinated me a lot in the beginning and at the end. There was a good story there, but the way it was brought over, never really losing the actual message out of sight. Now believe me the direction, the soundtrack and the cast are good. There also is a bit gore, but it fits good in the movie and is not unnecessary.  Yet this film is not flawless, it was good entertainment over all, yes and it was very good in the beginning and in the end, but in the middle when Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) loses it, so does the film and that is a shame. It is just too weird, too long and too incomprehensible (in the sense that the viewer himself doesn't know if it is real or not). It could have been so much better, but I guess it had to be.  NO MUST SEE BUT DEFINATELY WORTH A TRIP TO THE VIDEOSTORE OR TO THE CINEMA AT A DISCOUNT!!!!!!!!  7 out of 10  P.S. Don't agree?????, sue me!!!!!!!!!!! or mail me (see above)\", \"The Beach is interesting in that some people feel that its terrible while there are others who feel that it is an unsung hero of a movie. When I first saw The Beach, back in 2000, I thought it was OK, not as bad as most people said it was. But, just like with A Life Less Ordinary, The Beach grew on me and I had to watch it again. After seeing it a few more times I really started to pick up on what was going on and realized that at the end of the film the viewer has gone through quite an adventure with Dicaprio and co. The acting, cinematography, music, and story are great and hold up after repeat viewings. The Beach is one of those movies that I watch once a year as its enjoyability never decreases. This is a very solid film that will no doubt only increase in its popularity as time goes by as fans of The Beach are quite hardcore. Even though Dany Boyle has said that he is not very proud of The Beach I believe that he's made a gross error and misjudged his work because even after all these years The Beach still has a freshness to it that most films lose while they are still in the theaters. Because of these reasons The Beach will not die today.\", \"Recently a friend of mine watched \\\"The Beach\\\" after I told him my favorite quote (i.e. \\\"Never refuse an invitation, never resist the unfamiliar, never cease to be polite, and never outstay your welcome\\\"). He enjoyed the movie a whole lot and told me he hadn't watched it before because of it's low IMDb rating. That's when I decided to register here and post a comment - I hope I help someone else to watch the movie because it is worth a watch. What I personally like so much about this movie is that it is not just plain vanilla. It actually makes sense and can be a starting point for new thoughts and ideas - something I truly appreciate in a movie.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Believer\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0247199\", \"total_review_count\": 9, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"if you're considering seeing this movie for its political / cultural message, don't waste you're time. you're IQ will actually lose 5 points from viewing it. if you know anything about skinheads, white racialism, etc, you will instantly see problems with the movie that discredit the entire thing. for example, why does the main character have an AWB(Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging) tattoo? hes from new york, not south Africa, i fail to see how he'd have a strong enough connection to the Afrikaner resistance movement that he would tattoo their symbol to his body? its there because it looks something like a Swazi, although its really 3 number 7's connected, meaning 777 from Christian dogma. the only other reason he may have this tattoo is for its connection to the racialist group blood and honor, a group that also uses this logo sometimes. why he would get a tattoo of this group, which is still in existence and in many nations, i have no idea. there is no way the character portrayed in this movie would be a blood and honor member, for reasons too numerous for me to bother with here. also, when he attends the \\\"skinhead retreat\\\", they show a female with a completely bald head, as if she just had cancer treatments. this is another piece of sensationalism. while National socialist skinheads often are guilty of misrepresenting skinhead style and fashion, this is a silly exaggeration. however its meant to jump out at people who know nothing about these scenes, and take advantage of their ignorance. what about him walking around Manhattan with a Swazi shirt, him and his blatantly Nazi buddies walking around Manhattan drinking etc? the traditional skinhead scene in Manhattan is huge, and violent. they basically cleaned out the Nazi skinhead scene YEARS ago, and the remnants rarely if ever present themselves this way. maybe he could walk around like this for days, weeks maybe months and have no problems, but the truth is this is another bit of sensationalism. you just don't see this like the movie tries to portray it. as if this movie wasn't unrealistic enough. so, he gets caught with the Torah in his room, his fascist girlfriend finds it, and he makes her get dressed because being nude in front of it is a sin, according to Judaism. then he begins to read it to her, in Hebrew, and teach her Hebrew. so, this doesn't send up any red flags to her at all? I'm sorry but I'm sick of these sun dance winner movies being touted as great works of cinema, when they are really just awful white guilt trips. now i wasn't able to sit through the entire thing, but I'm going to guess that this movie totally avoided the fact that the vast majority of American skinheads are traditional, in the sense that they are not politically affiliated, are non racist, and are actually respectable members of the community. i wonder if i made a movie that showed Hasidim Jew's as only diamond smugglers and Zionist supremacists, would that win a sun dance award? there are a few scenes that cinematic ally are good, the opening scene is exciting and almost hard to watch, the fight at the retreat is good. there is some truth to the way NS skinheads are portrayed. other than those, i fail to see what made this film an award winner. seriously, don't waste your money like i did on this one folks, it stinks of agenda.\", \"Someone read too little Nietzsche and decided to encapsulate it all (a la Cliff-Notes) in the form of a little melodrama. Plays out the same as those tales of born-againers sowing their nihilistic wild oats only to find Jesus just as the thrill begins to get lonesome. It's just that this guy finds The Torah and decides the only decent thing left to do now is to act out on the wisdom of his Hebrew-school-inner-child that had somehow never been successfully challenged.

If you know about movies, you'd know this garbage is a waste of film. There is no dialog, no structure, no plot, no climax, NO NOTHING. This movie was all over the place and it was complete trash, The best character in the movie was SHLOMO, \\\"Stewart\\\" he only had 2 minutes in the movie. This movie is Jewish propaganda and it's trash, I felt like hugging Jews after i saw this movie. If anybody compares this movie to \\\"American History X\\\" they deserve to be shot and strangled. \\\"American History X\\\" is a very well written movie thats has a moral to the story, This Movie \\\"the believer\\\" on the other hand was complete trash. It didn't make any sense what so ever, Take my advice and don't waste your life watching this piece of garbage movie. I rather stick a knife in my stomach for entertainment, rather than touch this movie with a 10 foot poll. TRASH TRASH TRASH.\", \"A total snoozer. If it is based on a true story, then it took far to long to tell, and it just wasn't worth it. What was the point? He was a confused young man? Watch this movie and you'll be confused. The screenplay, characters, and acting are so weak. If there's a movie to miss, this is the one. I just can't believe the other reviews given this movie. This is one lame movie. If it's so great, would you ever sit through a second time? I doubt it.\", \"I found this movie, brain numbing more then anything else.  The director tries to portray Gosling as an intelligent underachiever with the wrong mindset, which is very hard to believe when they have Gosling slur out lines that you would think to hear on an Episode of \\\"South Park\\\", and to believe that he could have intelligent people listen and believe what he's saying is outrageous.  The supporting cast is also terrible, i really cant comment much on them other then saying that most of them would have been best suited in daytime TV dramas.  The action scenes suffer from the same disease, not believable, with fight scenes more at home in a B class movie.  I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie if you wanted to see something with depth and intelligence.\", \"I'd heard about this film when it won the Sundance prize, and immediately thought, given the accolade and the premise, that it had to be great. I also assumed it would be ultra-disturbing, so being somewhat squeamish, I waited a long time to actually see it.  What a disappointment.  The idea that a religious Jew could become a Nazi is indeed compelling, but this film never lets the viewer in on the WHY behind the main character (Balint's) decision, so, to continue watching, you just have to take it on faith that for some reason he has his reasons for inspiring a group of fascists to begin executing Jews. This, maybe I could have lived with.  But when this anti-Semitic Jew brings his thuggish skinhead buddies into a temple and has misgivings, here is where the lack of character development really becomes a problem. I could live with the assumption that for some reason this Jew's a Nazi, but, without any insight into the character, this business of his conflict, a seeming revelation of complexity, is just plain confusing.  Then, it commits the sin so many independent films do...by believing its overlong dialogue and speech scenes are compelling enough to drive a story forward. But this is minor in comparison to the nonsensical protagonist and the un-paid-off story lines: Balint shoots a fellow Nazi, Drake, when Drake discovers that Balint is wearing a prayer shawl under his skinhead clothes (again -- WHY???) I assumed he killed Drake, but, he doesn't...shouldn't there be some resolution to this turn of events, perhaps some jeopardy for Balint? For example -- your fellow Nazis find out you shot one of their own...shouldn't there be some sense that maybe Balint's life is now in jeopardy? Also, the leaders (played by Theresa Russell and Billy Zane) find out off-screen that Balint is a Jew. Shouldn't this also be a moment of high tension? This is a great, intriguing premise, but, the film is an extreme disappointment. I expected at some point that everything would tie together in a way that formed a cohesive, powerful, compelling, morally ambiguous narrative, but it doesn't. It's extremely unsatisfying throughout, and I really believe that its status and acclaim come from the premise alone.\", \"This movie who is supposed to be about the Jewish issue, is really nothing more than an absolute waste of time, except for one or two scenes. \\\"The Believer\\\" is just extremely poor. The scenes with his girlfriend are perfectly superflous and should not have been there at all. The so-called fascist family are incredibly bad casted and impossible to believe that these people are fascists, or should be in a movie with this theme at all. The main character too has absolutely no credibility. I suggest you see a documentary like \\\"Hotel Terminus: Life and Times of Klaus Barbie\\\" or some decent fictional movie which does not exploit its audience with superflous and hard-to-watch scenes of some actor trying to appear like something from reality.      \", \"The first thing I thought after seeing this movie was \\\"How is this possible that 'The Believer' actually won a price at the Sundance Filmfestival????\\\"  It's not that it's all bad, but it's not a movie I would call good. First, there are dozens of little errors. Especially in the beginning the editing is bad. Two times you get the feeling \\\"where am I?\\\" after a very quick cut to a scene somewhere else with the same characters. You get disoriented by it.  Another error, when Danny vomits on the street, his girlfriend (who is actually not yet really his girlfriend) comes after him and french kisses him!! Man, that's gross! You just don't do that!  The main character Danny, doesn't convince me either. Why did he become a skinhead? Okay, there's this explanation of banishment when he was a child, but I just don't see how you can choose for being a skinhead after that. And doesn't it seems slightly odd that although Danny has a huge collection of jewish items, knows hebrew by heart and doesn't want anyone to get close to the tora, and nobody seems to think, \\\"well, maybe he's jewish???\\\"  Last but not least, there's the acting. Especially the flash-backs are very bad acted. The young Danny-boy tries to much and thinks he's as good as Haley Joel Osment. Furthermore, the older Danny tries a bit too hard to look like Edward Norton in American History X. I have to say, some of his looks sometimes work very well, but alas, most of the time they're just rip-offs.  No, it really astonishes me that this movie won a prize. Well, it's just one prize, but because of that, I think less about the Sundance Filmfestival. A grand jury should know better than to give this movie a prize.\", \"I was really disappointed with this movie. It just DOES NOT make sense. I cannot believe all the 5 star reviewers. Does basic storytelling matter to you people? OK, where to begin......  Gosling's Danny Bolint is a militantly self-hating Jew. Why? Not sure really. Through use of some clumsily overdramatic flashbacks, we learn that Danny enraged his Hebrew School teachers by challenging long accepted laws of Judaism. OK, fine. So Danny learns some untraditional teachings from his father. How that evolves into violent hatred for his own religion is anyone's guess.  Well, as another reviewer wrote with the title, \\\"You better believe this movie deserves 5 stars\\\" explains:  \\\"Soon thereafter we learn that Danny himself was a yeshiva student. He's a Jew who has become a Nazi skinhead.\\\"  EXACTLY! Hey buddy, how do we go from point A to point B here? So his father teaches him some non-traditional interpretations of the Torah and suddenly he's some violent hard-core Jewish Nazi? Huh? I think we need A LITTLE more than that people! Another reviewer stated that \\\"you could tear any movie apart if you wanted to.\\\" Perhaps that is true. BUT this is a FUNDAMENTAL part of this movie! Its a fascinating concept that deserves a reasonable explanation. This movie fails miserably on this crucial point, that alone should keep it from 5 stars, but of course, there is much more:  OK, so after going into a synagogue, this violent Nazi who has no qualms about beating up Jewish kids, setting up bombs in synagogoes to kill dozens of Jews, has the uncontrollable urge to protect the Torah from his friends and other religous properties? Not just that, but he reveals his immense knowledge of Judaism in front all his fellow Nazis and gives them obvious hints that he's Jewish, for no apparent reason, throughout the film (ex. wearing a Hebrew cloth inside his shirt, keeping and protecting objects from the synagogue, goes to a Temple, says a Jewish prayer in his room and in front of fellow Nazis, teaching his bizarre girlfriend Hebrew. Why does she want to learn it? Don't ask me). Even though he says to the reporter that he would KILL HIMSELF if it was ever found out he was Jewish he gives these obvious clues throughout the film.  When Danny was with his friend attempting to shoot at a Jewish couple, he finds he can't/won't do it, and then his Hebrew cloth is revealed to his friend who realizes he's Jewish. Danny then shoots at him and leaves the area........OK.....Soooo what happens to his friend? Is he dead? Is he injured? Does he survive to tell anyone? The character completely dissapears and we never hear what happened to him. Once again, thats amateurish storytelling at best, dissapearing characters is not a minor detail. Jeez, I would get upset if this happened at a local high school play, let alone an award-winner that I'm paying money for!  Another unexplained event in the film is perhaps the best part: during the resensitivity seminar when Danny and his friends hear stories from Holocaust survivers. Danny offends the speakers and walks out prematurely even though the instructor warns him that he will be resentenced if he leaves. OK.......so what happens next? Does he go back to court? Is he sentenced to jail? Is he fined? Is he a fugitive? Better ask the 5 star reviewers, the fanatics in this website all these questions, because after watching the movie I can provide you with none.  Keep in mind, I'm ignoring the emotionless and puzzling girlfriend played by Phoenix, Is she a Fascist? What are her politics? Why does she like Danny? Why does she like to get physically hit by Danny? Why Danny showed no anger/emotion at Phoenix or Zane when he saw them making love, the make out scene the day after , right when Danny just threw up, what exactly makes Danny so incredibly valuable to Zane and the fascists, Zane's laughable hairpiece, etc etc etc. Point is, I was willing to accept ALL that as being \\\"minor\\\", however I cannot accept the HUGE holes in the script. Basic points like why he's a Jewish Nazi, what turned this violent person around so dramatically, and the missing and unexplained characters/events throughout the film.

I approached this film with an open mind, and was interested in the way it began. The opening is well put together, and the first half of the film gave me many reasons to laugh, and this is good.  However, the humor soon became repetitive, the plot became confused and strained, and I realized I was no longer enjoying the film. I have tried to avoid saying this, but the movie became rather \\\"cheap\\\" - not a bad thing for a comedy if the humor holds up, but it didn't. I confess that I may have missed some of the humour, not being Jewish myself, and having little experience with Jewish culture. However, considering how heavily telegraphed the bulk of the humour was in this film, it's unlikely I missed much.  The idea is a good one, and perhaps if a little more thought was put into it the film would have been watchable all the way through. I wish I could give the movie a higher rating, but strictly speaking it would have been better as a TV series or as a series of skits. There was just not enough worthwhile fresh material for a full-length movie.

Hebrew Hammer (Adam Goldberg) sets out to save Hannukah from Evil Santa (Andy Dick). Perhaps a promising enough basis for a plot, in actual fact the film does not progress beyond this premise. While there are some (far and few) nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent, it is laboured, hackneyed and ultimately, mindlessly boring. This despite the fact that Goldberg, Dick and Greer (Hammer's client/love interest) all have quite considerable screen presence. Despite being played for what might be described as whacky over-the-top gags, this film is consistently middle-class middle-of-the-road muck. DO NOT waste 85 minutes of your life on this. (note- the music was good..!)\", \"The Hebrew Hammer is a clever idea wasted, as the execution is weak. As if often the case with iconoclastic humor, it relies overly on outrage to generate laughs, which simply isn't enough. Poor-taste humor has two elements -- poor taste and humor -- and both are needed here, but the humor is pretty scarce. As a result, it is often painful to watch, all the more so because of good attempts on the part of the performers, particularly Adam Goldberg as the HH himself. The Shaft references are funny, though, but only to those who know those movies, and they certainly don't carry The Hebrew Hammer.  Another problem is that many of the jokes rely on knowledge of American Jewish culture, and many in the audience will simply not understand the jokes.\", \"I was expecting to this to be hilarious and it was mediocre at best, the only funny character is, believe it or not Andy Dick.

Worthy of note is the lack of visuals concerning the actual murders...rarely do we see the cat or the killer.

Made using the same visual and narrative techniques as the previous films, this one is not so successful in achieving the same quality as other two of them. \\\"The Leopard man\\\" is a sort of \\\"mixture\\\" between a horror film and a film \\\"noir\\\" or a \\\"balance\\\" between them, if to say it correctly.   The story is simple: a leopard escapes from a traveling circus in a small New Mexican town and terror begins to reign when the corpse of a young woman is found apparently dead as a result of leopard's attack. The hunt for the leopard begins while more people become victims of a ferocious animal, meanwhile the question arises: Is it really the leopard who is guilty of all those murders? 7/10\", \"Apart from its classic murder sequences (particularly the first with its bloody pay-off), this one has an original, audacious structure (criticized at the time because it was not understood) with the narrative following minor characters every once in a while and veering off into seemingly unrelated subplots - a half-century prior to Tarantino's would-be seminal PULP FICTION (1994), but also Luis Bunuel's THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY (1974)!!  Dennis O'Keefe is a wonderful lead as the sleuth figure; in fact, the film is actually more of a thriller since the murders do not have a basis in the supernatural (as was the case with the previous two Lewton/Tourneur collaborations). Though Jean Brooks is ostensibly the heroine, Margo is given more screen-time and her role is a lot more interesting: her performance as the doomed artiste - frequently resorting to her fortune-teller friend Isabel Jewell, who unfailing turns up the death card! - is quite moving. James Bell underplays his pivotal role as the museum curator/animal expert (which is similar to the brief doctor part he essayed in I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE [1943]); also fine is Abner Biberman as the owner of the escaped leopard, who blacks out during his frequent drinking binges and thinks he may be the murderer.  The small-town atmosphere is brilliantly captured on a studio set (marred only by some corny elements in the script intended to accentuate the local color, such as the over-use of Margo's castanets - to the point where they even become a motif - or the birthday song delivered to the second victim of the titular creature&#8230;but, especially, the infuriatingly stupid mother of the little girl - who bullies her innocent and fearful daughter to an early grave!); the 'outdoor' climax, then, is given an added touch of strangeness by taking place in the midst of a procession headed by a group of caped villagers!  Curiously, both the Leslie Halliwell and Leonard Maltin film guides give the running-time as a mere 59 minutes; however, the two times I've watched the film, it's always been by way of the full-length 66-minute version! William Friedkin's Audio Commentary is a good listen, despite his tendency to describe the on-screen action (though almost always accentuated by his own interpretation of events); this was his favorite among the Lewton horrors - and, in fact, it's very much underrated among fans but, personally, I loved it immediately!\", \"The Leopard Man is a triumph of style over content. The plot of an escaped leopard terrifying a community certainly justifies calling this a horror film, but it succeeds as a minor masterpiece in the genre only because of the elegant direction and cinematography, which took advantage of the black and white medium. In the DVD Val Lewton Collection , Citizen Kane is mentioned frequently, both for its artistry and for its financial disappointment; (though I have read that in fact it turned a small profit.) Also mentioned are the films of Astaire and Rogers, and their use of black and white photography. It may be that Lewton and company learned from their RKO predecessors, especially Citizen Kane; in this case to cast an ominous aura over the action. The color black is the key, from the time that the leading lady decides to wear a black gown for her night club entrance with the leopard. The leopard image is used to foreshadow the deaths of the two young girls. In one case the black hand shadow of a leopard head made by her brother hangs over and behind her head as she leaves the house. In the other, the mother of the second victim is seen carrying a black cat in her arms. Then there is the Ace of Spades dealt to Margo by the fortune teller on two occasions. All very stylish! If not for the men behind the scenes the film would have been lost in the abyss of B films gone and also forgotten. The performances are about as wooden as one would expect in a typical B film, with only Margo conveying some of the tension one would expect from persons in a small town with a frightened leopard on the loose. However, special note should be taken of Dynamite, the big cat who receives billing, possibly as a result of his terrifying performance in Cat People, when he set the stage for the action, chewing on a large roast in his cage. However, one cannot help but be puzzled by the fact that a black panther is playing a leopard (which in this film did change his spots). Did RKO have him under a long-term contract? Comparing his performance with those of the actors reminds me of the supposed comment of director van Dyke after the filming of Rose Marie, starring Nelson Eddy as a mountie: \\\"It was easier to get a good performance from his horse than it was from Nelson\\\".\", \"I saw this movie many years ago,and it was plenty scary,especially,the part,where the mother wouldn't let her daughter in the house,unless she brought food,so she went to get food and on the way back,she saw white eyes looking at her,and she started to run,she got to her mothers house,but it was to late,she gets attacked by a leopard and her mother sees blood coming from under the door,when she opens the door she sees her daughter laying dead,that is about all i remember about the movie and often wonder if it will ever be released on video. i really would love to see this movie again.i would like to see if the movie is as scary as when i first saw it.\", \"Val Lewton's productions have long been treasured by cinematic aestheticians. This accrues not only from his singularly intelligent treatment and subtle presentation of macabre themes, but from his recurring Lewton \\\"stock company\\\" of players. How we Lewton devotees savor the return of Jane Randolph, Jean Brooks, Isabel Jewell, Russell Wade, Sir Lancelot, Tom Conway, Ottola Nesmith ! etc. etc.  Less noted perhaps, are the recurring props to be spotted in Lewton films. Thus, Ottola Nesmith's tufted Victorian sofa from \\\"The Leopard Man,\\\" later becomes the property of Miss Julia Dean in \\\"Curse of the Cat People, besides making an appearance in Lewton's \\\"Mademoiselle Fifi,\\\" and a 1966 episode of ABC's \\\"That Girl\\\" ! Likewise, Miss Nesmith's daughter in the same film, (\\\"Teresa\\\") sleeps in the same curly maple bed destined to later belong to little Ann Carter in \\\"Curse...\\\".  Many other Lewton props follow this same recycling pattern, i.e., Kim Hunter in \\\"Seventh Victim,\\\" turns up in that film's cocktail party sequence sporting Jane Randolph's fur trimmed topcoat from \\\"Cat People\\\"; the exterior double doors to Simone Simon's \\\"Cat People\\\" brownstone apartment building do double duty as the entrance to a hotel in \\\"Seventh Victim,\\\" as well as serving as portals to the museum in \\\"Leopard Man.\\\"   These delightful economies, however, may have more to do with RKO than Mr. Lewton, since Julia Dean's Victorian chairs may also be spotted in the non Lewton productions, \\\"Beware My Lovely\\\" and \\\"Experiment Perilous.\\\"  Lewton aficianados may also be interested in a minor blooper from the \\\"Seventh Victim.\\\" In that film Jean Brooks has unpainted fingernails throughout, however, the close-up of her (alleged) hand moving across the stucco wall during the Greenwich Village chase sequence (inexexplicably) features a hand with dark nail paint.\", \"This film holds up well as a good, basic thriller. It doesn't have the same kind of strange, mystical power of other Lewton films, but is effective at invoking the image of dark streets at night, when the most ordinary sidewalks and street lamps take on a sinister feeling. The most remarkable aspect is the surprisingly strong and unconcealed sexual motive for the killings. SPOILERS AHEAD: The murderer's confession at the end is reminiscent of the speech Peter Lorre makes to the kangaroo court in Lang's M. His compulsive, rambling confession has a strangely authentic quality, of the words spilling out awkwardly and spontaneously, trying to make sense of his crimes as much to himself, as well as justifying his actions to others. Though a blatantly sexual motive isn't mentioned, it's hard to interpret his words any other way, except as a twisted, rape sort of feeling. The photography is excellent and the performances at least adequate. Two sequences are especially effective, the young woman trapped in the locked cemetery, and the terrifying encounter of another girl with the escaped panther under a railroad bridge. This last sequence still has the power to unnerve the viewer sixty years later, and is one of the best of the Lewton \\\"buses\\\". This may seem petty, but at least two other viewers have commented on the same theme. The mean-spirited mother who refuses to pay any attention to her daughter's story of the escaped panther, and dismisses it as a lie to get out of going to the store, and then cruelly locks her out of the house, must be the most obnoxious mother outside of Cinderella. The younger brother mocks his sister's fear, by throwing the shadow puppet silhouette of a leopard's head on the wall of the kitchen, but is seen doing the same thing in the funeral parlor, where his sister is lying in her coffin. Whether this was intentional, or the child actor felt like doing it and didn't know the camera was on him, I don't know, but I found myself yelling at the DVD player, \\\" That a..hole is still doing it! What the hell's the matter with you?\\\" No one in the movie even seems to notice.\", \"For publicity at a nightclub, Kiki's manager Jerry Manning gets his hands on a tame black leopard for her performance. But it gets scared, and manages to escape into the small New Mexico town. The town becomes incredibly frightened, when one dead body is replaced with another each night and the evidence is pointing towards the leopard. Although Jerry doesn't believe it is the leopard doing the brutal killings, but someone using it to their advantage.  \\\"The Leopard Man\\\" is another from the Val Lewton staple and it's probably his most unique one too. After directing the minor classics \\\"The Cat People\\\" and \\\"I Walk with a Zombie\\\", Jacques Tourneur returns with another successful stint in the power of suggestion with slick finesse and creepy atmosphere to boot. Tourneur's masterful direction carries the disjointed and fairly unconvincing screenplay by Adrel Wray. The interlocking structure that shifts back and forth between major and minor characters is an interesting (if ambitious) experiment for its time. While being well paced (since it just clocks over the hour mark), it plays more like separate little stories or set pieces to the bigger picture. This gave it an unpredictable pattern on who's going to get it next. This was achieved by the way chance-like camera-work sweeping across the screen onto different characters. Strangely enough the minor stories are far more interesting than the major one of Kiki and Jerry. The problem was I didn't particularly feel any sympathy for any of the characters (well, only the first victim) and the film's final revelation is rather flimsy and truly unfulfilling. Tourner likes to focus on the individually cold-hearted deaths with great skill and subdued intentions. The intensity he brings to the screen with great use of the camera, lighting, sound effects and the music score only added to the dramatic effect of each scene. This was enhanced by the hauntingly bone-rattling edge and eerily shadowy sets. He sure demonstrates some compelling patches that truly are blood curdling without the need of showering the viewer with too much detail. The first death scene is a perfect example. The performances are mostly fine from a fancy cast, if little underdone by Jean Brooks and Dennis O'Keefe. The problem is that they feel to glitzy than being down-to-earth folks. A zippy Margo definitely shines in her flamenco dancer role. Also floating by are sound turns from Ben Ward, Abner Biberman, Isabel Jewell, James Bell and Keefe Brasselle.  What mostly keeps you involved with \\\"The Leopard Man\\\", is Tourneur's memorable touches and Margo's colourfully etched performance.\", \"\\\"The Leopard Man\\\" is a pretty good entry in the genre.  **SPOILERS**  Working in a Spanish-theme nightclub, Kiki, (Jean Brooks) and Clo-Clo, (Margo) are surprised when club-owner Jerry Manning, (Dennis O'Keefe) decides to pair Kiki up with a leopard for her act. When it runs away during the performance, the police scour the city for it. Shortly afterward, a vicious crime-spree sweeps through the city where all the victims are viciously slaughtered. Admitting that the leopard is behind the attacks but concerned that the show needs go on, they continue to keep the nightclub open during the investigation. As they decide to pool their resources together to hunt the leopard down, new evidence comes to light that it may not be the creature after all. Finally able to solve the case, they go out to try to catch the killer cat before it strikes again.  The Good News: This one is a little better than expected. One of it's best features is that the creature is loose at the very beginning of the film. The very first scene in the film has the cat loose means that there's plenty of opportunity for attacks spread throughout, and there's something for the film to go for in terms of action. The first confrontation is it's best overall scene, as it's inside an exceptionally creepy location with some great action scenes and a fantastic conclusion that is far ahead of the types of attacks generally shown at the time and becoming quite violent and brutal. That it, for once, actually takes place off-screen through sounds makes it a lot more thrilling than it really should be. This is a really great, chilling scene that is suspenseful and spooky. There's even a mild amount of bloodshed from the attack. A scene in a graveyard preceding an attack is pretty creepy and suspenseful as well, with a long, stalking-like set-up through a pretty creepy-looking location. That there's a sensible-sized body count also works, making it seem a lot more fast-paced despite all the talking in-between. All of these are part of it's pluses.  The Bad News: This one here was a pretty flawed film. One of the worst ones is that it spends tons of time on useless scenes and subplots that serve no purpose in the film. The scenes with the family celebrating the birthday are the most obvious. There's no reason to feature these scenes at all, as watching a family member wandering around picking up a gift and then celebrating with each other is a giant useless series of scenes. These are placed in the middle of a series of scenes that are simply excruciating to sit through. They're boring, dull and have nothing at all to do with the cat tale. They're also hard to sit through for the fact that nothing interesting goes on in them. It's not exciting to see that scene after scene of watching people do absolutely nothing yet continue to talk away. That there's not even an attack as a result of these scenes is only another matter against them. It happens off-screen after a pretty nice set-up. That's what makes the scene so infuriating. These make it a little more flawed.  The Final Verdict: While this one's a little flawed, it does have some good moments in it to make it a little more watchable than most. Recommended viewing for fans of this style of film, or for those who want to see a more subdued creature feature, though those who like more action-packed films seek caution.  Today's Rating-PG: Mild Violence\", \"Well, Jaques Tourneur is a great director. I saw many films by him. I liked most of his works for they are smart. They all have something inside, more that one can expect. This 1943 film is a great detective psychological film. It has to do with a narrow circle of people who are investigating the deaths of several women in New Mexico. They think that the ran away black leopard is killing people, but more they investigate the more they get to know that someone close, who is killer. A lot of cemeteries pictures are here. This film has good suspense and music. I would recommend this film for people who are fond of Hitchcock and black and white surrealism.  Andrey Grachev  www.myspace.com/neizvest\", \"Half the fun of watching \\\"The Leopard Man\\\" is trying to figure out the plot structure. If you haven't seen it yet, don't read the rest of this review. It's a good creepy little film, and that's all you need to know.  For those who have seen the film, here are my thoughts on it: A symphony traditionally contains four movements. This is the structure of \\\"The Leopard Man\\\". After an attention-grabbing introduction, in which the main theme (clattering castanets) is introduced, along with the main characters (Jerry, Kiki, Clo-Clo, and the escaped leopard), we are treated to four movements.  1st movement: Probably the best of the four parts, we begin with Clo-Clo playing her castanets while walking down the street. She picks a card to receive her fortune, and it's the card of death. This sets an ominous tone when we are suddenly introduced to a completely new set of characters--a poor Mexican family. The daughter is sent to buy some cornmeal, and we have a wonderfully suspenseful scene where she fears an attack by the leopard. The movement climaxes with her death, a perfect combination of visual, audio, and (especially) what's left to the imagination.  2nd movement: We once again have a brief encounter with the main characters and a reminder of the castanet theme. Then we are introduced to a whole new set of characters--a young girl, her family, and her off-camera lover. Another creepy scene takes place in a graveyard, and it also climaxes with the young girl's death.  3rd movement: We are again reminded of the main characters, but this time we begin to follow their stories to completion. The third movement focuses on Clo-Clo, and the castanets, though present, are used sparingly. This completely develops the death card story which was foreshadowed earlier in the film. Once again, this section climaxes with the woman's death.  4th movement (the finale): Up until now, due to selective camera shots, we haven't been entirely certain whether the killings have been the result of the leopard or someone else. The escaped leopard's story is concluded by finding its dead body. The remaining cast's story is also carried out to the end. The true murderer is revealed--once again with the aid of the castanets--and killed. The climax of the entire film is the death of \\\"the leopard man\\\".  In all of his films, Val Lewton played with the idea of life vs. death, and this film is no exception. The castanet music throughout the film helps us to experience the dance between life and death. The deaths are always shocking, and they initially seem to have the final word. But the final scene actually shows the victory of life. Jerry and Kiki walk off together, determined to make the most of their lives together.  We don't know how long we have on this earth, so we should cherish every moment. And only through death can we appreciate the gift of life. This is the message of Lewton's and Tourneur's thrilling, beautiful, and sometimes unsettling symphony.\", \"A leopard was to be used in an act, until it ran away and panic began in this helpless village. Such is the plot in this Val Lewton production. As usual, Lewton and director Tournier know what they are doing and are able to scare the pants off the viewer with violence that is implied and is never actually seen. The fact that the leopard's victims are women and that we see them running and afraid fuel our increasing anxieties. While it doesn't have the mood of \\\"I Walked with a Zombie\\\", it is in contrast a straightforward story of an animal/enemy that needs to be caught and/or destroyed for the safety of the community. But, there is a twist. The killings don't look like an animal did it.  Starring Dennis O'Keefe, who was a prolific B-movie actor in the 30s and 40s, and Margo, who was in real life married to actor Eddie Albert of \\\"Green Acres\\\" fame and mother of Edward Albert of \\\"Butterflies Are Free\\\", this is another Val Lewton must-see horror film. Its climax and denouement are somewhat disappointing (but that's up to you) and it's to the taste of the viewer whether you like this or \\\"Zombie\\\" better, but, all in all, it's vastly superior to the gore you see today. No one could do it like Lewton.\", \"This mysterious period thriller/horror from genre veteran Jacques Tourneur remains one of the creepiest chillers RKO ever produced. A vicious leopard escapes from a nightclub act and a series of brutal murders begin to take place. Is the leopard the culprit? Tourneur keeps the audience guessing and never lets the secret out till the very end. While the film as a whole may be a bit slow for today's standards, it's main set-pieces (the trapped-in-cemetery scene; the blood behind the locked door sequence; the eyes in the dark scene) retain their shock value. This rare classic is a forgotten gem that should be seen by any fan of classic horror, not least because it reminds one that horror at one time was about more than just bloodsoaked ultra-violence.\", \"A pressman (Dennis O'Keefe) hires a leopard for a publicity stunt for his client (Jean Brooks) in New Mexico. The leopard accidentally escapes and a rash of gruesome murders happen that look like the work of the leopard...or are they?  Not really a horror film as many believe. It's a murder mystery with horrific touches. It contains two very frightening sequences--one in which a young girl is locked out of her house while the leopard is after her; the other is one of the scariest locked in a cemetary after closing sequences I've ever seen.  The movie is short (59 minutes) and interesting and one character (Raoul) has some of the most beautiful face shots at the end--hard to explain, you have to see it. The dialogue is intelligent and the characters have depth and you're kept guessing up to the very end what is going on. Well worth catching.\", \"Kiki and Clo-Clo (I just love these names.) are rivals in a nightclub act. To upstage Clo-Clo, Kiki's boyfriend arranges for her to enter the club with a black leopard on a leash while Clo-Clo is performing. But things don't go as planned and the leopard escapes. Later that night, a young woman is killed outside her home by a leopard. More deaths of women are blamed on the leopard. But is it really the leopard that's responsible for the deaths or is a maniac using the leopard as a cover to commit murder?   The Leopard Man has an unusual story structure that I find very appealing. Most of the events in the movie and most of the people (or victims) we meet occur through the movements of Clo-Clo. As she walks through the streets, she runs into or passes seemingly random persons. We are immediately taken into their world for a brief glimpse of their lives before the inevitable occurs. It's the realization that these people are unknowingly in danger because of a chance meeting with Clo-Clo and they can do nothing about it that creates much of the suspense in The Leopard Man.  The Leopard Man features some of the best set-pieces and scenes Val Lewton ever put together. The death of the first girl, Teresa, is the most obvious example. To get home, Teresa must go through a tunnel knowing full well that a leopard has escaped and may be inside ready to pounce. This scene is nothing short of scary. It's one of the most frightening moments from a Lewton movie. Teresa finally reaches home but is unable to get inside the house. Before her mother and brother can get the door open, Teresa is attacked. The camera pans to the floor to show the blood running into the house. It's a very chilling moment and one of the best that Lewton ever made.  Most of Lewton's films have a \\\"look\\\" to them that I find very pleasing. In this department, The Leopard Man doesn't disappoint. Everything from the \\\"noirish\\\" look of the city streets to the use of shadows to create atmosphere gives these movies part of their distinctiveness. Lewton couldn't afford fancy special effects or high-priced actors, so he made up for this by creating some of the most visually stunning movies I've seen. In short, The Leopard Man is a real treat to the eye.\", \"******SPOILERS********  Atmospheric horror from the original Lewton crew. The stars are kind of weak and the script isn't as good as the first couple of Lewton Bs, but there is moody photography and a few scenes of real suspense. Some element of sexual violence can't make this film sexy like \\\"Cat People\\\" (in this case, we get middle-aged Bell instead of sexy Simone Simone), and the exotic locale isn't up to \\\"Zombie\\\" par either. The plot carries the film through its (short) length: a search for an escaped cat leads one man to seek for a human killer behind the alleged cat's killings.   It seems like it would have been more interesting if that man (O'Keefe, playing it straight) had turned out to be the killer himself, but I guess that's maybe what the writers though the audience would expect.\", \"The Leopard Man is a master class in efficient scripting and filming on a budget. Despite being 70 minutes long, it has a large ensemble of characters from different areas of a small New Mexico town - English and Spanish, rich and poor, entertainers, police, scientists - all involved in some way in a story about an escaped leopard who may be hunting humans. A mood of fear and foreboding is economically created with plays of light, sudden noises, eerie music, and unseen objects moving in the shadows. The animal attacks occur in darkness and behind doors, but are filmed in such a way as to be suggestive of greater violence than if they had been shown explicitly, and this is very effectively scary. A remarkable film.\", \"This is a 1943 movie. The main storyline revolves around a madman killing young girls while casting the blame on a fugitive leopard...original? Hardly... CHARLIE CHAN AT THE CIRCUS (1936) showed the same device (but it was a gorilla there). The psychopath finally confessing that he's a victim of his urges he cannot control...original? Hardly... 1931's M (Fritz Lang) showed the very same device, so I'm sorry dear mr. Tourneur but you didn't fool ME there. In a city full of Mexicans a tough guy impresario plans a coup de theatre that backfires and a leopard is let loose...people start to die. First is young Teresa...her gargoyle 150kg three-inches-thick-eyebrows mother won't understand her fear of darkness and send her on errands at night to buy...wheat for...tortillas (!!!) so that she's killed on the doorstep of her cabin. Second is a well-off girl who goes on a secret date in the cemetery, overstays and meets her doom. Third a dancer... In spite of its lack of originality, acting is fine, plot contrivances work and atmosphere is good. Worth watching. Were the main actresses hot or what...? One struggles to believe the dancer died in 1985 nearly 70...\", \"Jerry Manning (Dennis O'Keefe) is the manager for a nightclub performer named Kiki Walker (Jean Brooks) and he gets the bright idea to have her bring in a leopard one night. The leopard gets spooked and runs off, only to maul a poor girl later that night. When more young victims are claimed, Jerry begins to doubt that it's still the work of the leopard.  The New Mexico setting is a very good one for this well done Val Lewton production. It provides this incredibly spooky tale with real flavor in addition to the brooding atmosphere common to the Lewton canon. Director Jacques Tourner here had his third and final teaming with Lewton (after \\\"The Cat People\\\" and \\\"I Walked with a Zombie\\\") and he really ratchets up the tension in some scenes. The sequence in which initial victim Teresa (Margaret Landry) is obliged to walk through a tunnel under a train overpass is completely unnerving. Lewton and Tourneur do a great job of setting up the scares with use of sound and firing our imagination as to how gruesome these murders are.  Ardel Wray wrote the screenplay (with an additional dialog credit for Edward Dein) based on the Cornel Woolrich story \\\"Black Alibi\\\". While it works very well as horror, as a mystery it's not so successful, with the perpetrator's identity a little too easy to guess. And the denouement isn't as satisfactory as the balance of the picture, although the motivation for the spree comes off as too creepily real, with what we now know about serial killers. And in the end, there's a bit of meditation on how people sometimes try to hide their feelings and fears behind a show of coolness and imperturbability.  This is well worth catching for any fan of the classic style horror movies. It's a real gem with an always palpable mood and feel.  8/10\", \"This film is part of the Val Lewton Horror Collection, released on DVD a short time ago. Each disc contains two feature films. This one was with \\\"The Ghost Ship.\\\" I found the latter far more entertaining than this movie.  I first saw this movie in the mid '90s, was not that impressed, but gave it another look when I acquired the Lewton set. On the second viewing, I lost interest halfway through and stopped it.  After a great start, with an extremely suspenseful scene with a woman outdoors alone on a dark street with a panther loose, but after this dramatic part the film bogs down big-time....down to a crawl at times. If only the second half had kept that early momentum up.  There are a lot of nighttime scenes, as was the case with a lot of Lewton's atmospheric films. Since I still own it, I'll give it another look. Who knows? Maybe the third time will be a charm.\", \"Dennis O'Keefe and Jean Brooks decide to elevate their act in New Mexico by having Brooks walk on-stage with a black leopard. The Mexican castanet dancer, Clo Clo(deliciously played by Margo), mashes the castanets menacingly at the cat, it flees, and a panic spreads amongst the people of the little village. Soon, one girl dies, then another, and another...and evidence points that a cat did it and later to something completely different. The Leopard Man is one of those rare films that is very effective with shadows and fog without showing anything. We never see any of the deaths happen \\\"on-stage\\\" so to speak. The imaginations of the viewers are enlisted to conjure up what might be the scene of each murder. Director Jacques Tournier and producer Val Lewton probably team up for their best collaboration. This film is laced with moody atmosphere, great pacing, quality performances, and a script worked over by the camera that enforces theme and symbolic meaning throughout. I found this film haunting, eerie, and poetic in its own way. O' Keefe, James Bell, Margo, Brooks, and the entire cast give credible turns and enforce our ability to accept what is going on.Some scenes are quite memorable: the young girl walking back home from the store is a classic scene of terror, the cemetery scene, and the procession of the monks allowed Tournier to work his magic with the lens. Tournier was always able to tell so much story with so little dialog. Though some might find the ending a bit of a letdown, I thoroughly enjoyed The Leopard Man.\", \"Is Jacques Tourneur the laziest director ever? He let the audience do all the work. At least he did when making little suspense programmers under producer Val Lewton, who headed RKO's second-feature unit in the wartime 1940s. Hamstrung by parsimonious budgets, they racked their brains for ways to make their movies look good and pack a wallop. Their solutions proved inspired, resulting in a string of classics \\u0096 The Cat People, The Leopard Man, I Walked With A Zombie \\u0096 that still rank among the moodiest, most memorable fright-films ever made (with different directors, Lewton oversaw The Seventh Victim and other distinctive works in the same vein). With The Leopard Man, Tourneur was handed a script that showed little promise; when he was finished with it, it shone with his distinctive black magic. That magic was to suggest rather than to show; to plant seeds in viewers' imaginations and let them grow.  In a sleepy New Mexico town that somehow supports a posh night club, publicity man Dennis O'Keefe gets an idea to promote an act by arranging for the star (Jean Brooks) to make a grand entrance with a big black leopard on a leash. The cat escapes \\u0096 and soon the deaths begin.  First a girl sent out into the night to fetch cornmeal for mama's tortillas finds the corner store closed and must venture further afield. Tumbleweeds stirred up by the dry winds and trains hurtling over trellises are unnerving enough, but then something else starts its pursuit. She almost makes it back safely but the lock is stuck....  Next another young woman sets off in late afternoon for an assignation with her boyfriend at the cemetery. When he doesn't show, she loses track of time and improvidently finds herself locked in among the gravestones and statuary....   A posse sets out to find and kill the leopard, but O'Keefe begins to doubt whether the killer is in fact feline. It's in the resolution (based on a story by Cornell Woolrich) that the script ultimately disappoints, but the trip to it remains a dark ride. Those minuscule budgets didn't compromise the movie's decadently glossy looks, and the extraordinary Roy Webb's castanet-ridden score keeps the tension taut (one high, sustained, almost pianissimo chord hangs over the cemetery scene). The mistress of the castanets, a cabaret dancer called Clo-Clo, is an actress called Margo; the ace of spades keeps turning up in her fortune. Her performance lends The Leopard Man what little heart it shows.\", \"A far better than average early film from the Val Lewton unit, The Leopard Man is as much murder mystery as horror picture. It is set in a New Mexico town where there are some weird goings on, including, among other things, big cat attacks. The photography is exceptional, moving from subjective to documentary-style objective without drastically altering the tone of the picture. What horror there is comes more from a sense of dread than anything that actually happens; also from the eerie feeling that certain places are unlucky, that some people are bound to die simply because of where they are. How true.  The star players are somewhat dull, but the supporting cast is quite good. And the merging and sometime colliding of the Anglo, Hispanic and Indian cultures is nicely presented. There is a sense of primitive feeling, of old religion, throughout the film, implied rather than stated, that is beyond the grasp of the hyper-rational lead players. We can catch this mood in fits and starts, but like the major characters, it eludes our grasp. Jacques Tourneur's direction is masterful every step of the way; and he uses music sensually yet emphatically, and the result is a fine-tuned film. It's major flaw is the revelation of the culprit, yet once Tourneur accepted the script's limitations he works superbly within them. The best thing about the movie is that its most crucial events happen mostly off-screen, leaving a good deal to our imaginations. And the minimalist script leaves a great deal in the dark, and even after the picture's florid, almost surreal climax, the air of mystery lingers. There are loose ends for sure, but Tourneur's polite, civilized touch dresses them up to appear profound and suggestive rather than threadbare, and the result is a pleasing conclusion that does not quite give the whole thing away; and we are left wanting to know just a little bit more. Tourneur was a true master.\", \"Perhaps not as mysteriously beautiful as \\\"Cat People\\\" or not as nightmarish as \\\"The Body Snatcher\\\", but still this Val Lewton production equally is a solid horror milestone that should be viewed by everyone who wants to learn about the roots of atmospheric horror. The screenplay, adapted from the Woolich novel \\\"Black Alibi\\\", is simple ...yet powerful enough to provide the film with a good 60 minutes of pure tension. Soon after a leopard, hired from a traveling circus for a publicity stunt, escapes from a fancy nightclub, horribly mutilated bodies begin to turn up in a Mexican border town. Is the animal really tearing everyone on its path to pieces or is someone abusing the town's mass-hysteria to satisfy his/her own urge to kill? Director Jacques Tourneur once again proves himself to be a master in creating an unbearably tense atmosphere. His excessive use of shadows and darkness turns the sets into ominous places while the constant unnatural sounds keep you alert for possible animal-attacks! Who needs a budget when you've got this much talent and style? \\\"The Leopard Man\\\" is an excellent film, one to watch preferably in series with \\\"I walked with a Zombie\\\" and \\\"Curse of the Cat People\\\".\", \"Slimly-plotted but handsomely-produced second-biller about an escaped leopard in a small dirt town in New Mexico apparently the cause behind several deaths...or is it? Intriguing premise given stylish film-noir treatment. Performances are solid, and Jacques Tourneur's crafty direction lets you see just enough before fading to black. Val Lewton produced, and he gives the proceedings his customary spooky polish. Film tails off near the end, but is still a minor gem. Fantastically atmospheric and fun. Based on the book \\\"Black Alibi\\\" by Cornell Woolrich.   *** from ****\", \"****SPOILERS**** Dark and creepy film based on the Cornell Wollrich novel \\\"Black Alibi\\\" about a leopard on the loose in the desert and towns of New Mexico. With deep and disturbing psychological overtones that strikes more fear in the hearts of those in the movie and audience then the big cat itself.   Publicity agent Jerry Manning, Dennis O'Keefe, trying to spice up his client Kiki Walker, Jean Brooks, nightclub act gets her a black leopard from a local carnival to upstage her rival at the club Spanish dancer Clo Clo, Margo. On the first night of Kiki's act with the big cat the leopard gets startled by an angry Clo Clo who put her hand-clickers almost in it's face. The noise made the cat break away from Kiki as it disappears into the night.   With the local police as well as the towns people looking for the escaped black leopard it later crosses the path of young Teresa Guadalupe who's outside going to the store to get corn meal for her mother to make dinner. Terrified with fear at the sight of the almost demonic-looking black cat Teresa drops the bag of corn meal that she has and runs for her life with the leopard hot on her tail.   Getting to her house her mother doesn't let poor Teresa in because she didn't have the corn meal and thought that her story about her being chased by a big cat was just an excuse for her to let her in the house. A moment later there's a terrifying scream and then all is eerily quiet. Realizing that something is terribly wrong Teresa's mother runs to open the door she sees a stream of blood oozing under it, the cat killed little Teresa.   Terrifying movie that plays with ones nerves like a violinist pays with the strings of his violin. With sounds and shadows instead of special effects and really packs a wallop by doing it. There's three scenes in the movie where someone is killed including the one with Teresa and everyone of them brings the tension to such a hight where your nerves are at the point of breaking down. You just can't wait for the nerve racking scene to finally end where at the same time the director of the movie, Jacques Tourneur, keeps you totally in the dark to what's happening off screen.   Tourneur direction shows how the mind can be easily tricked and manipulated by an imaginative film maker with nothing more then lights sound & shadows. And thus brings far more shocks and jolts to his audience back in 1943 then what the best state-of-the-art special effects can do in a movie today.   Even though \\\"Leopard Man\\\" touched upon a lot of psychological aspects of the human, as well as animal, mind it pre-dates the movie \\\"Spellbound\\\" which many consider the first major Hollywood film about the subject by two years.  The films dark and eerie ending in the darkening New Mexican desert amid a black hooded precession to commemorate the 17th century slaughter of the towns original inhabitants, by the Spanish Conquistadors, was one of the most creepiest sights I've ever seen in a movie.\", \"In an age when serial killers are deified, what Val Lewton and company wrought so long ago must seem tame, indeed; quaint. But THE LEOPARD MAN is anything but a tame little \\\"murder mystery\\\": it's a spooky psycho-sexual story about a serial killer feeding (as is the serial killer's wont) on the innocent. Cornell Woolrich (whose novel BLACK ALIBI was the impetus for this film) was definitely ahead of the curve on this one and the Lewton approach (to suggest rather than to show; to imply rather than indulge) fits, if you'll pardon the allusion, like a glove... Woolrich and Lewton were both on the same wave length, and THE LEOPARD MAN comes highly recommended.\", \"Well, for the most part, anyway. In a rural part of New Mexico, actress Kiki Walker is competing for attention with a local castanets dancer. Kiki's manager brings her a leopard on a leash so she can show the dancer up during her performance. Her rival one-ups her by snapping the castanets right in the leopard's face, which drives it wild. It breaks free from its mistress' grasp. As it flees from the night club, a waiter raises his hand: three bloody claw-marks from trying to stop the wild beast. The meat of the film is made up mostly from three tragedies resulting from the leopard - or do they? Okay, so the \\\"or do they?\\\" part isn't great, but those three tragedies are three of the best sequences in film history, no doubt. The first concerns a young girl forced by her mother to buy cornmeal in the middle of the night. Her younger brother meanly teases her by making leopard-shaped shadow puppets on the wall. The second involves a young girl who has gone to the graveyard to put flowers on her mother's grave, and also to meet with her lover. When she doesn't find him there, she becomes depressed and doesn't hear the groundskeeper's warning that he is locking the gate. The third happens to the castanet player, whose fortune teller turns up the ace of spades for her several times in a row without fail. An expert expresses the belief that the leopard could not have caused all of these events, so the film becomes, unfortunately, a whodunit. The answer is obvious immediately, even if it's not believable. Fortunately, the direction is so excellent, as well as the set pieces, that even with such a weak solution, the film is a near-masterpiece. 9/10.\", \"After their success in 1942 with the fabulous 'Cat People', the star team of producer Val Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur would team up twice the year later. First for the compelling and brilliant 'I Walked With a Zombie', and second for this film; The Leopard Man. For the movie, the two filmmakers re-cast the star of their first success, the big black leopard, in this movie, who once again plays a big black leopard. The screenplay this time round makes far better use of the animal at the centre of the film, which allows the impressive creature to make a much bigger impression on the movie, and it also gives the film a unique edge over other horror movies, as there aren't a great deal that can build around a leopard. In fact, one thing that struck me about this movie was it's similarity to the 1980's remake of Cat People, and I wonder just how much influence that film took from this production. Anyway, the story here is deliriously simple and it follows a leopard that has escaped from a nightclub. After a few deaths, the cat is blamed...but is there more to this scenario than meets the eye?  Just like Val Lewton's earlier and later productions, The Leopard Man is notable for it's breathtaking atmosphere, which is once again up there with the greatest ever seen in cinema. The use of shadows and lighting is impressive, and when you combine this with Jacques Tourneur's incredible ability to stage a scene amidst this atmosphere; you've got a recipe for a truly great horror movie. This movie isn't as full of great scenes as Cat People was, but there is still some really good stuff on display, including my favourite scene which sees someone mauled behind a closed door. I'm not a big subscriber to the idea of 'less is more', but the scene I just mentioned goes to show just how well it can work if utilised properly. If the film had directly shown the killing, it would have uprooted the atmosphere and the terror of the movie on the whole wouldn't have been as astute. As it happens, The Leopard Man has got it spot on. But then again, would you expect anything less from a Val Lewton production?\", \"The escape of nightclub performer's leopard is followed by a series of mutilations--but are these the work of the leopard or of a serial killer stalking a small southwestern town? Although not one of producer Val Lewton's better known films, director Tourner endows the story with considerable atmosphere, and the result is a moody and intriguing film that holds it own with the more celebrated CAT PEOPLE and I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE.  Like other Lewton films, THE LEOPARD MAN relies more upon what it suggests than upon what it actually shows. This film is particularly effective in building suspense in a series of scenes that show various characters walking--a saucy Spanish dancer strolling along the street, a frightened teenager making a night-time trip to the grocer, a young woman rushing through a cemetery at night. The cinematography is elegant in its simplicity, and the sound design is quite remarkable. Hard to find, but Lewton fans will find it worth seeking out.  Gary F.

How anyone can take the subject of sexually abusing children and turn it into a \\\"thriller\\\" is just sick. Auteuil (whom I had previously admired) going around like some sort of child-saving Rambo was ignorant and insulting to all the children being sexually exploited around the world.  What's doubly depressing is that the stunning and ground-breaking film \\\"Happiness\\\" came out the year BEFORE this film. Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves. It's admirable to read some of the comments by the more intelligent viewers out there. They were able to see the shoddy and ridiculous handling of this topic. Those of you who think this is great cinema display a disgusting amount of ignorance and you need to watch \\\"Happiness\\\" to open your minds to the true horrors of pedophilia.  Do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or be molested by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even a relative? Hmm...I wonder.

For Nastassja Kinski, `Paris, Texas' was much better. The biggest disappointments were from Chris Menges (`CrissCross' and `A World Apart' cannot even be compared with this one), and Goran Bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from `Queen Margot' for this movie (Attention to the end of the film). If this was an American pop movie, I would not feel surprised at all; but for a European film with more independent actors and director, a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simple-minded and disappointing. There are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people. There are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone. And finally, there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys. Every character is shown in simple black and white terms: the good versus the evil. Plus, from the very beginning, I could understand how the story would end. Is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse? I believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie. I think this movie was not disturbing, but very disappointing.\", \"In The Lost Son, a private eye searching for a missing man stumbles upon a child prostitution ring.

I mean with good actors like that, how could you possibly screw up such a movie?  Albert Pyun knows the way.  The way this film is put together, it feels like a reject from film school shot and edited this piece. Hmmm, how many times does Seagal walk down the same hall? Or drive up in his pickup truck? Why are half of his lines spoken when he's off camera? What's up with the sound editing when Sizemore is interrogating Pressly? Pyun even managed to screw up the action sequences. Seagal doesn't throw a punch until near the end of this movie, and when he does get some action, the camera is so close in on him, you don't really see the moves.  Save yourself the rental fee. If you want to see a decent Seagal action flick, your money is better spent on Exit Wounds.\", \"It is the worst movie that I saw in the last years! Disgusting! After Exit Wounds - in my opinion the best in Steven Seagals's career - it is not acceptable.

All the fight scenes took place in the dark making it difficult to see the action and the camera angles suggested that someone else was doing Mr. Seagal's fighting for him. Why would one view a Steven Seagal movie other than for the martial arts? In this film, it sure wasn't for plot, special effects, or acting. All of the tension was derived from digital timers. I'd pass on this one.\", \"Why did i bother to even watch the film? God works in mysterious ways.

Really, this film has it all: bad acting, everyone from extras to lead actors seems to be in a daze as they offer up their lines. Bad accents, even Dennis Hopper's. It comes and goes as if half of the movie was filmed before they decided that his character should have an Irish (?) accent. Poor production, including but not limited to, sacrificial police vehicles, at least a decade and a half old and dressed up just enough to appear as a working car before being blown up. Several rent-a-helicopters that don't even get a generic \\\"Police Department\\\" sticker slapped on the side. Or, how about a hand grenade that, when detonated, erupts as a fireball instead of a shower of fragmented metal. My personal favorite though, is the late model BMW convertible that, just before exploding, turns into a not so late model BMW 4-door sedan. Also, are we really expected to believe that after so many police officers and civilians have been killed, and so many buildings in the city have been blown up, that the only person making any decisions as to how the whole situation is handled, is Joe Spano's beleaguered captain. I ended up giving this film a \\\"2\\\" for two reasons. The first being that after a while, it was almost entertaining watching for the next goof. Secondly, I gave it a \\\"2\\\" because, no matter how unlikely it seems, there is probably at least one movie that is worse, and I'll need to have the \\\"1\\\" available for that.\", \"This is a bad bad MOVIE. If you plan on watching a good action flick watch anything other than this, yes I said anything, comedies have better action. There is one good side to this movie however and that is it can be used in video classes at universities to show an example of what not to do when making a movie of any kind, for example, don't even make a movie that is so boring people can tell by looking at the actors faces.2 : spend the extra money and get a wardrobe so the actors can change clothes 3: don't use archive footage and if you absolutely must use archive footage don't get footage that doesn't make sense, like a single car exploding next to a body of water doesn't make sense when matched with an explosion or accident of two cars in a land locked area. These are some of the many examples of things that go wrong in this movie (did anyone else see the amazing jerky blue-screen?). So once again I would like to commend the director and editor on making a great instructional video on what not to do when making a movie.  \", \"Well, I have myself to blame. I should have read about the movie and should NOT have rented it. But I did. :-(  I like Steven Seagal. He is usually in entertaining movies with very good fight scenes. Be advised ! This is no ordinary Seagal movie. The little fighting he does is in the end of the movie and it is so bad that you wonder if he has gained so much weight that he can't move anymore.  Well. What more can you say: This is a REALLY bad movie. The copy I rented had DTS sound. For what ? So that the explosions can sound good ? The other parts of the movie has really bad sound.

The acting was plain horrible. I saw school plays which were better acted. Took me half an hour into the movie to realize Hooper's character is Irish,cause his accent was on and off. And Seagal looked like he was bored with the whole thing,and just wanted to be paid so he could go home.  The special effects weren't special at all. A few standard explosions which I could live with,but that scene where Hooper and Pressly are driving in the car...was there anyone who didn't notice the use of a blue screen?It couldn't get more obvious than that...  So,okay-the plot,dialogue,acting,special effects-they all stink,so what about some typical Steven Seagal fighting scenes to save the day? After all,that's why we usually watch his movies,right? Well,not this time! Can you believe there were none?! Only one stupid scene where we only see Seagal's face and then a shot from the back when his double(probably)is fighting(if you can call it that)for him.Meaning,we never actually see Seagal fighting.

I don't know how or why a film of this depressing quality was ever put out, it makes me want to cry.\", \"Tom Sizemore is the tormented cop with something to prove. Steven Seagal is the \\\"Zen Master\\\" (yet again) of the bomb squad. Dennis Hopper is the mad bomber who looks like he dropped straight in from filming \\\"Speed\\\". Jaime Pressly is the eye candy. This movie has many illogical and ridiculous gaffes that, if you bother to take 2 seconds to think about, will leave you stunned and wondering \\\"What the *..*?\\\" There is no rhyme or reason to this non sequitur. However, with a beer or two, a light-hearted attitude, and a few irreverent buddies to yuk it up, you could actually enjoy laughing at. I know I laughed at this movie from beginning to end, even without the beer. But trust me, you'll want the beer.\", \"i just cant imagine why anyone would release such a trash. i can only assume that the director wanted to make fun of the audience. i love steven s. and dennis hopper, but this time they have outdone themselves. especially the car-blackbox scene with hopper. unbelievable. for me one of the worst movies ever. congrats.\", \"Despite it going straight to video, you might be thinking, \\\"Well, it has Steven Seagal, so it at least must have a good amount of action.\\\" Think again. Seagal doesn't do anything until near the end, and his martial arts sequences are so rapidly-edited and close-up with the camera, someone with no martial arts sequences could have taken his place and had the same effect. In fact, most of the movie shows Seagal sitting down and/or shot from the chest up (probably to mask his weight gain in recent years.) He hardly does a thing! And there's hardly any other action in the rest of the movie - this is one BORING movie, and I couldn't wait for it to end.  If you do rent the DVD, you might find it interesting to hear the director/producer commentary (despite minutes on end going by without a comment). Not only did it confirm my suspicion that A LOT of stock footage was used, but that it was shot in a short time - just twelve days! Seagal was only used for six days, and Hopper did all his scenes in just one day!\", \"Disclaimer: I like Albert Pyun's films. But \\\"Ticker\\\" is awful. I don't know how it could have happened. OK, I suppose I do know how it happened. It was, after all, pretty easy to spot the doubles used for the actors in over half the film, as well as the bad looping accompanying it. The opening stock footage sequence and endless shots of the bomb-disarming (or is that 'device-treating'?) robot in action didn't help the picture any either. This was a low budget effort, only it was a low budget effort made in a terrain unfamiliar to Pyun \\u0096 Los Angeles. Even in a \\\"bad\\\" Pyun film (Omega Doom, Blast, Nemesis 4), there is that familiar Pyun style that makes the experience palatable. But in this case, if it weren't for the appearance of various Pyun players (Weisser, Malcon, Halsey, and a lunchbreak cameo by Ice-T), I would have never been able to tell that \\\"Ticker\\\" was directed by Pyun. There was no thought put into this one whatsoever, it seems. I'm more apt to believe what was implied on the director's commentary, that over-the-hill-and-then-some action guru Steven Seagal had more to do with the production of this movie than Pyun did. Yes, I did listen to the commentary. And if I didn't feel like an hour and a half were stolen from my life beforehand, I felt twice the impact after viewing it with the audio track. My advice to others: if you feel the masochistic desire to see the DVD, and have any interest at all in the commentary, just watch it with the commentary the first time and get it done with. You won't miss a thing from the movie, as minutes \\u0096 nay, entire chapters \\u0096 go by without either of the guys saying a word. I'm not sure why they even bothered with a commentary; it's fairly obvious how this movie was \\\"made\\\".\", \"Ticker is a strange movie. It starts out promising, with a good cast, nice story and lots of action. Especially after watching \\\"Out for a kill\\\" which I did 2 weeks ago, this one seems to be much better. And in fact, it is better, especially the acting. Tom Sizemore does a good job, Dennis Hopper is adequate as the bad guy and Joe Spano in a small roll is good too.  So what's wrong? First of all, Steven Seagall obviously gained a lot of weight. He just sits there, at his desk or in his car, except for the last 15 minutes or so when finally he decides to kick some ass. However: it is painfully clear that for the action scenes, a stand-in is used. I replayed these scenes in slow motion to verify this, and it is very obvious. Shame on Steven for this.  A lot of scenes are really dark, which makes it very hard to see what's happening. Also some of the scenes are too chaotic with good and bad guys running around looking the same. \\\"Out for a kill\\\" had the same problem.  Right at the start of the movie, the scene where Seagal's troops jump out of the helicopter by ropes, it is clear that the rope is hanging in a studio. Besides, I have no idea why these bomb experts would land on the roof while they know there's a bomb in the basement.  The blue screen car scene with Dennis Hopper and Jaime Pressly has been mentioned a few times already. It is good for a few unintended laughs. The same goes for Hoppers part-time Irish accent, the old police cars with wrong plates and the police choppers without even the word \\\"police\\\" on them.  Later on, Jaime blows up the BMW convertible with Hopper in it. It is painfully obvious that the car that's blown up is another model, a much older 4 doors saloon instead of the 2 doors convertible. There's even another car visible blowing up right next to the BMW. I don't know where it came from. Even the surrounding buildings are different before and during the explosion. I suspect this explosion was taken from another movie.  The final scenes take place in city hall, where a bal masqu\\u00e9 is going on. The room where this takes place looks like a discotheque. Now really, what city hall would look like that? Not surprisingly, this scene too is taken from another movie.  Near the end, Steven walks up the stairs towards the roof of city hall to dismantle the bomb on the roof. However, several men with machine guns are sitting there. When they start shooting, Steven decides to walk back. Walk, not run or jump, even when men firing their guns come after him, he takes his time to get some cover. My grandfather walks faster than that.  Finally two bombs have to be dismantled. One is in the basement, and Sizemore has to take care of this one, following instructions by Seagall. This is the right time for Seagal to preach some Zen before telling Sizemore how to deal with the bomb. When the bomb in the basement is secured, Seagal takes care of the other one. This is really easy. He just cuts some wires, the timer stops and that's the end of the movie. No suspense, no final fight, no good feelings.  My rating: 4/10. One point because this one's better than \\\"Out for a kill\\\", one for Tom Sizemore, one for... I don't know. And one for Steven Seagall, for old times sake.  Better rent The Glimmerman or one of the other old style Seagl flicks.\", \"This movie leaves us the impression that the actors have been hired to appear at a rich kid's party instead of playing a part in a movie. Barring a great deal of respect for Dennis Hopper, Steven Seagal and the others, this movie looks like \\\"a day at the office appearance\\\" for most of them.  Point your finger at the director because he is responsible for this low-level picture.\", \"My reason for seeing this dung was simple: I liked the title, as well as actors Tom Sizemore, Steven Seagal, and Dennis Hopper. Nothing could prepare me for how awful this film truly is. This is the definition of a cheap straight to video movie. TERRIBLE action; AWFUL acting; EVERYTHING just sucks about this film. Take my word for it, don't waste your time or money watching this film.  The actors obviously only did this film for a paycheck.

The first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-story and think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I am not the only one to think this) it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, When is this d**n ship going to sink??? And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but definetly not great either. Was I glad DiCaprio did not win an oscar for that film, I mean who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He does 1 half-good movie and won't do a film for less than $20 million. And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it. But enough about, in my eyes, the worst character of the film. Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. I also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together. There is one lesson to be learned about this movie: there are too many love-stories as it is, filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie!!! Out of a possible 100% I give this film a mere 71%.\", \"When I saw this movie I was stunned by what a great movie it was. This is the only movie I think I would ever give a 10 star rating. I am sure this movie will always be in my top 5.  The acting is superb. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are at their best. I don't think anyone could have a better job than Kate.   If it is a rainy day and you can't decide what to rent, well, this is the one. You will love all the acting, special effects, and much much more.  If you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now!!! You won't regret it.  \", \"Why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like The Godfather. Titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st Century.With great acting,directing,effects,music and generally everything. This movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn't like it any more so most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this movie, not only being the most heavily Oscar Awarded movie of all time, the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies I've ever seen. Apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time. The only movies that come close to being like all the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings trilogy or anything by the masters Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good movies and directors but none match up to James Cameron's Masterpiece TITANIC.\", \"What's inexplicable? Firstly, the hatred towards this movie. It may not be the greatest movie of all time, but gimme a break, it got 11 oscars for a reason, it made EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS for a reason. It's a damn good movie. Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it. I have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when I saw it in theaters. I've rewatched it on TV and video, and it had none of the impact it had when I saw it on the big screen (twice, or maybe three times, actually). But that might be it, the appeal of it. It's a Movie, yes, capital M there, it's an Epic, it's a spectacle in the order of Gone With the Wind or Ben Hur. Now, Ben Hur and Gone With the Wind seem kinda hokey to me, with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama. Not that Titanic has none of that. Well, the acting was actually very good. The melodrama was quite heavy-handed at times.  But the reason Titanic works is that it's such an emotional ride. I usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind, or give me a visual thrill. This movie isn't exactly dumb, but it's not cerebral at all. The visual thrills are simply means to an end, to fuel the emotions of the audience. I didn't cry when Bambi's mom died, I don't react to tearjerkers. But this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million, an emotional rollercoaster that, if it were a regular one, would make Buzz Aldrin scream like a little girl. And I'm sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it, and have a ready supply of cynicism, then you can thoroughly dislike this movie. But if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit, if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt, you'll enjoy it completely. And look at the top ten grossing films of all time. Is a single one of them bad? Is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10? No, not even The Phantom Menace. And this movie made 1.8 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide. It can't be bad. Not possible. 10/10.  p.s. how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman? spiderman was a fun movie, but it was a total 9/11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did. it simply wasn't anything all that special. no one will remember it in 50 years. but i'm pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.\", \"Previously, I wrote that I loved \\\"Titanic\\\", cried at its ending (many times over), and I'm a guy in his 60's. I also wondered about why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users.  Well, I looked at the breakdown of the user ratings. While 29.0% of all votes gave it a 10 rating, 10.7% gave it a 1 rating. These 10.7% of these irrational imdb users, in effect, pulled the overall rating down to 7.0.   In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voting pattern (a sudden surge in 1 ratings, with a high 10 rating, dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level) on only one thing: hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people (young men, mostly), who defame him left and right. They absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part in giving him any credit in \\\"Titanic\\\". (To answer one other user: I am NOT talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc. Everyone has, and is entitled to, his/her own taste. But no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for \\\"Titanic\\\", pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.)  Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of \\\"Titanic\\\" to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical \\\"bombs\\\" (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point). \\\"Heaven's Gate\\\" (1980) was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing, and imdb voters' ratings were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall rating of 6.1). \\\"Big Top Pee-wee\\\" (1988) got 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating of 4.5). \\\"Cat People\\\" (1982) got 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.8). \\\"Blind Date\\\" (1987) got 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.3). \\\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\\" (1986) got 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.2). WHAT DO ALL OF THESE FILMS HAVE IN COMMON WITH \\\"TITANIC\\\"? ALL OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE LOWER !!!! THAN \\\"TITANIC\\\", AND NONE OF THESE STINKERS EVER WAS NOMINATED FOR A SINGLE AWARD. Again, \\\"Titanic\\\" got 10.7% 1 ratings! Compare that to the other 5 movies I just mentioned.  Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo factor?  \", \"I loved this movie since I was 7 and I saw it on the opening day. It was so touching and beautiful. I strongly recommend seeing for all. It's a movie to watch with your family by far.  My MPAA rating: PG-13 for thematic elements, prolonged scenes of disastor, nudity/sexuality and some language.\", \"The movie Titanic makes it much more then just a \\\"night to remember.\\\" It re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten. Why so criticised? I have no idea. Could/will they ever make a movie like Titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it. Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece. It will be almost impossible.  The director no doubt had the major impact on the film. A simple disaster film (boring to watch) converted to an unbelievable romance. Yes I'm not the Romance type either, but that should not bother you, because you will never see a romance like this. Guaranteed! Everything to the amazing effects, to the music, to the sublime acting.   The movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling. Everything looks very real and live. The legend herself \\\"TITANIC\\\" is shown brilliantly in all classes, too looks, too accommodation. The acting was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best at playing there roles. No one could have done better. They are partly the reason why the film is so great.   I guess it's not too much to talk about. The plot is simple, The acting is brilliant, based on a true story, Probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears, thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten. Well if you haven't seen this film your missing out on something Hesterical, and a film to idolise for Hollywood. Could it get better? No. Not at all. The most moving film of all time, don't listen to people, see for yourself then you will understand. A landmark. (don't be surprised if you cry too)\", \"I had few problems with this film, and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly. I don't think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5/10. Bethany Cox.\", \"I think James Cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies. Anyway, everyone remembers the RMS Titanic. It was big, fast, and \\\"unsinkable\\\"... until April 1912. It was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever. Well James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well, onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film.  So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They're not annoying too much but watch this and you'll find out why they could become annoying ( http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn ). The main villain I guess is bad luck, fate, hand of God (no blasphemy intended), or just plain Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what do you get?! Oh yes! We get a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting characters are the following: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber)(idk he was so nice), Lovejoy(David Warner), Murdoch(Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith(Bernard Hill), Molly Brown(Kathy Bates), and many more. We also got the present day treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good. In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. I give Titanic, an 86% awesome\", \"Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. Writer/Director James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic. The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good on-screen couple. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.\", \"The ship may have sunk but the movie didn't!!! Director, James Cameron, from 'The Terminator' did it again with this amazing picture. One of my favorite scenes is 'The Dinner table' scene, in which Rose's family and friends meet Jack after he saves her. Rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet 'THE ONE'...I hope I have that look when I am in the room with my future husband.  Jack and Rose have a connection that is 'MOVIE STUFF' but it's good movie stuff. We have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth. Rose almost commits suicide but the Gilbert Grape star rescues her. I really liked the hanging over the boat scene. It was a good risk.  The movie is long but it's fantastic!!! Good story, good flow, good actors!!! Go see it twice if you want, Its worth it!!!\", \"Titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies. It has its problems (what movies don't) but still, it's enjoyable.  When I stumble across someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is \\\"wait a minute, you don't?\\\" I know so many people who don't like this movie, and I'm not saying I don't see why. \\\"The love story is too cheesy\\\" well, yes but isn't it enjoyable and moving? All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this doesn't actually exist. But this is a movie, doesn't everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well, OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials. However I think it's unfair to say that they are terrible actors. I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.  And finally, if one is going to complain that they don't like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things. It's like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this IS a good movie.  Well deserving of its Oscars, in particular, Best Cinematography, which I find to be the best I've ever seen in a movie save maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie. The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it's an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.  I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.  I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults. The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.  I give this movie 10/10, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it's an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.\", \"Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie didn't have a solid ten, overall in the IMDb user rankings. Maybe, it's just cool to not give Titanic credit nowadays, but when it was first made it was really something. When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters. When it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason. Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot, like the frozen baby, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd. Many people died on that ship, and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that James Cameron stepped up to. And let's not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone's imagination it was lovely. They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They sure as hell are giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. \\\"I'll never let go, Jack.\\\" Titanic is a great film down to it's very core. It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music, and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers. It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie.\", \"For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance. The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a truthful, interesting and entertaining film about it. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is Rose's and Jack's story alone, no one else. Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home. The music has become iconic and legendary. It is composer James Horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience. The song after so long has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is. Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime. My heart won't go on from this one.\", \"Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, best movie of all time, no, just depends on your idea of a good movie, but Titanic delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage.  The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude, wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. She and her granddaughter Elizabeth \\\"Lizzy\\\" Calvert visit Lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old Rose boards the ship with her fianc\\u00e9, Cal Hockley and her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, both of whom stress the importance of Rose's engagement to Cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the Dewitt-Bukater debts: while they have the outward appearance of the upper-class, Rose and her mother are financially broke. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling Cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first-class formal dinner of the rapport-building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of Irish dance, music and beer in third-class. But after Cal's servant informs him of Rose's whereabouts', Rose is forbidden from seeing Jack again. However, after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven-year-old daughter to behave like a \\\"proper lady\\\" at tea, Rose defies him and her mother, asking Jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the Heart of the Ocean, an engagement present from Cal. After a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time, they go to the deck of the ship.  They then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg. After overhearing the ship's lookouts discussing how serious the collision is, Rose tells Jack they should warn her mother and Cal. Meanwhile, Cal discovers Rose's nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe, so he frames Jack for stealing the Heart of the Ocean by having Lovejoy plant it in Jack's pocket. Upon learning Cal intends to leave Jack to die below deck, Rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him. Jack and Rose return to the top deck. Cal and Jack, though enemies, both want Rose safe, so they persuade her to board a lifeboat. But after realizing that she cannot leave Jack, Rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with Jack in the ship's first class staircase. Jack and Rose return to the top deck, the lifeboats have gone, and the ship finally goes down into the freezing Atlantic taking Jack and Rose down.  So does Titanic live up to it's hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie. But it has great acting, amazing effects, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. It will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too seeing that I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. But all that aside, I do recommend this movie, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.  10/10\", \"James Cameron's 'Titanic' is essentially a romantic adventure with visual grandeur and magnificence, a timeless tragic love story set against the background of this major historical event...

No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism. Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it. It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I've seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe. One for the ages.\", \"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however. Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane). Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game. If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries. The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.  The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred. One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search. She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic. With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding. After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned. Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the Titanic's legs out to full speed. The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie. On April 15, 1912 at 11:39, an iceberg was sighted. They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film. The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate. The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2:18 when the lights finally failed. The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanic's many pleas for help. The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own. The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship. Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking. Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle. Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.  Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship. The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time. Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanic's officers were real. The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards. He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaire's Captain when the Titanic sunk. The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol. He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former Canadian hometown. As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-English speaking nations. In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted. The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss'. Not wanting to leave her husband's side Mrs. Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic. Furthermore, Mr. Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best. The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water. Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke. All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs. The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the Post-Victorian era of 1912. The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet. Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do. The rich did not take well to `new money' such as Molly Brown as depicted. Everything of the time was very formal. Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie. Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken. The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.  A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise. The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives. Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night. In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic. Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored. This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed. However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed. There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed. As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.  Technically the film is very well done. To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie. In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean. Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship. Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage. This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner. At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.  Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic. Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing. If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.  \", \"I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it. I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do! I guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many.   As for those that think that this film is \\\"overrated\\\" or \\\"over-hyped\\\"...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol* You see, it's not CRITICS/article writers that make a film \\\"HUGE\\\" or a \\\"HIT\\\" with the general movie-going public. PEOPLE make the film a huge success. With Titanic, everyone was in awe. Let's face it, a film like this had never been made before. At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched!   Give this movie a break you guys! The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was \\\"overhyped\\\"...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being \\\"overhyped\\\". ha! Critics didn't even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film. However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more!   Personally, I LOVE this film. However, this film might not be for everyone. DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though! THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it...the REAL star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship! I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job. It's not thier best work (I've seen much BETTER work from both of them) but it wasn't the WORST I've seen on screen before. Give them a break!  \", \"I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. \\\"It was so great,\\\" she said. \\\"You really felt like you were on the ship.\\\" \\\"Nonsense,\\\" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, \\\"you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested.\\\" \\\"Well, maybe,\\\" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. \\\"OK,\\\" I thought, \\\"I'll give it a look see.\\\" I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.  Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost \\\"you are there\\\" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect \\\"t\\\" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of \\\"My Heart Goes On.\\\"  Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.   A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.  9/10\", \"To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.\", \"Every once in a while the conversation will turn to \\\"favorite movies.\\\" I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they're too embarrassed now to admit it.  I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.  No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.  James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.  This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, \\\"flying\\\". \\\"Iceberg, right ahead!\\\" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.  The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.  I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I've had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.  Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.\", \"There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film. Let's just face it, though, the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. I'm not saying they're not good actors, I'm saying they stunk in this film. The special effects were decent (and I will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye-pleasing), but IT even has several major flaws. For instance, right before the ship goes under, you can see an unfinished blue-screen image behind your main characters.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the story of the REAL Titanic, but I find this movie an insult to that story. Editing was atrocious--there's no reason for any film to be over 2 1/2 hours (with the exception of MAYBE a biographical movie), and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted.  I will say that the music was perhaps better than I could have predicted (and not just the \\\"My Heart Will Go On\\\" song either). There is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard. That could very well be the highlight of the film. As for the mood throughout, it was extremely dull. I was more relieved than sad when Jack died, which I know cannot be what the director intended.  In a nut shell, I find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the Titanic into an over-hyped chick flick.\", \"I, like many people, saw this film in the theatre when it first came out in '97. It was a below average film at best, defiantly not the \\\"masterpiece\\\" that all these \\\"Titanic\\\" fanboys like to make it out as. First off, DiCaprio is a terrible actor no matter which way you look at it. People just like him because of his looks. His acting \\\"skills\\\" essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy. Second, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot: girl falls in love with guy, ship they're on sinks, lots of crappy love scenes thereafter. Anyone with an IQ above 50 will realize this isn't ingenious in any way whatsoever. Nor is it original. Plus the director felt the need to drag it out for 3+ hours. I could compress it into a 1 hour block without losing any of the plot. In conclusion, \\\"Titanic\\\" is the most overrated movie to date. Why it got so much attention and money is beyond me.\", \"I see people writing about how great this movie was. It was horrible! The acting was sub-par at best. It made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; why it sank, what was running through a lot of people's minds; maybe even a little conspiracy stuff. Does anyone realize that certain people didn't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off? No, you don't because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked (did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid?).  I did cry in during one scene, though. The scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship. It looked like pool water! I'm thinking this movie made all this money and they couldn't even make the water from the ocean look real? unbelievable...  Ohhh the band played on while the ship sank.. Just ridiculous. This was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor outdid it in the \\\"Nothing to Do With Reality\\\" department.\", \"First of all, as a long time student of the Titanic disaster and member of several Titanic clubs, I feel entitled to comment on the film. I don't really care how many awards and accolades the film won, but to me it is still an absolutely awful film. Cameron had the resources to make a 'proper' semi-documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po-faced romantic mush. The fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows, to my mind, the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days. Whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love? In fact most real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster certainly was not one. I feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible. I almost threw up in the last sequence where the 'dead' lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause. Is this an intelligent film? Ask yourself.\", \"What I think I'll probably like best about the new Star Wars film, \\\"Phantom Menace\\\", is that it will likely blow \\\"Titanic\\\" out of the water, if you'll pardon the pun, when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts, and thereby knock it out of the number one spot. Every time I hear someone declare \\\"Titanic\\\" is the greatest film they've ever seen, I think to myself, \\\"You don't see a lot of movies, do you?\\\" What a travesty. You could make 50 good films that are a lot better than \\\"Titanic\\\", and for the same price tag.  \\\"Well, it won lots of academy awards, lots of people really loved it,\\\" as someone might say in its defence. Well, lots of people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but that doesn't mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans CAN be wrong.  I'll be the first to admit, that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype over the film. I waited a month or so to see it and ultimately, it didn't live up to the expectations set upon it, which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story. It's true, \\\"Phantom Menace\\\" will likely suffer a similar fate. but.  James Cameron's \\\"Titanic\\\" is. a) a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece. b) a three-hour epic that has it's finest moments given away in the trailer. c) a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment. d) something left better to documentarians, which I would've enjoyed much more. e) a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship. f) a robbery of 3 hours that I will never get back, therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine I can think of. When I meet someone who hasn't seen it yet, I say, \\\"I wish I could trade places with you.\\\" g) a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia. How long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences? h) thankfully a film that wasn't recognized for any acting achievements at the Oscars. i) a technological achievement in filmmaking, and little else.  The only reason I post this as a anonymous comment is I do NOT welcome the rebuttal of 10,000 thirteen year old Leonardo DiCaprio fans who'll no doubt come to his defense, and I am not really interested in hearing a defense of Titanic's story, acting or length.\", \"I've just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A bunch of kids, 14 to 22 put on the DVD of \\\"Titanic\\\" on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal. Only two of them had actually seen it before. But they all had seen the moment of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the epic started, they started to get restless, some of them left asking the others -- \\\"call us when the iceberg appears\\\" Over an hour and a half into the movie, only the two girls who had seen the movie before, were still there. They started shouting: iceberg, iceberg. A stampede followed, they all came back to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat open mouthed, emitting Ohs and far outs. So, just like I thought when the movie first burst into the scene. What is this? One and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it. Dr. Zivagho, for instance, had a similar running time, but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time. In \\\"Titanic\\\" Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the, supposedly, creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship. Look at the historical details, if you can find them. The storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink. The real sinking here is of film standards. All the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends. The film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so, what do I know?\", \"Once upon a time there was a director by the name of James. He brought us wonderfully, thrilling science-fiction such as Terminator and Aliens. These movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry. Terminator 2 showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new era.  .......and then it happened...................1997........countless awards..........obscene amounts of money............outlandish barrage of advertising............maximum profit margin........Titanic was here!  I have never (ever) been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly critical for the sake of it, in fact I have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going. Titanic however was a film I only took one single positive out of - that of Kate Winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughout!  Quickly - the dialogue was like something out of Beverly Hills 90210, the acting was more wooden than my nephew's tree house, images meant to terrify were actually comical (man falling from ship and hitting propeller), historically false (don't even get me started because there's too much), it had dire theme music (up there with the bodyguard for cheese) and the pointless love story was so tedious, self absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved (I was glad when he died and disappointed when she did not).  It was plainly obvious from the word go that this picture was designed to appeal to MTV watching, bubblegum chewing, boy-with-car chasing, teenage girls (DeCaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band) who would drag their sex-starved boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chick-flick hoping to get lucky later! The worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point. Millions of dumbed down, culture vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because \\\"it cost so much to produce it must be great\\\" and \\\"Steve and Barbara said it was good and they know their movies\\\".   The crowning glory arrived when Titanic swept the boards at the Academy Awards. King James of Hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based. It looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people.   However, if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off. Good luck to Hollywood if that is how they want to make money, I'd do it if I had those kind of chances in life!  It is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly, historically false/human interest tripe like \\\"The Patriot\\\" and \\\"Pearl Harbor\\\".\", \"The tragedy of the doomed ship Titanic has inspired many books and movies. The battle between nature and technology always caught man's imagination. The latest film concerning this tragedy in the Atlantic Ocean was written and directed by famous action movie filmmaker James Cameron. The story of \\\"Titanic\\\" involves two fictional characters (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) from different backgrounds (one is a hobo-artist, the other is an aristocrat) and how their love triumphs over societal barriers and the tragedy of a sinking ship that they happen to be on.  First of all, although using a historical name, this movie had little regard to history. The plot was built around two fictional lovers, French diamond, and treasure hunters. The deaths of over a thousand of people on the greatest luxury ship of its time became a mere background. Many historical facts were simply forgotten. Where was the radio operator that ignored the iceberg warnings? Why was there no mention of the ship that was only 5 miles away from the Titanic but did not come to the rescue because its captain failed to identify the distress signal? Omitting these facts is an insult to the tragedy. And what was the point of flavoring this historical disaster with fictional cheesy romance when the story is already as sad as it is.  The overall plot was rather shallow; rich equals greed and corruption, poverty equals compassion and heroism. It is very ironic to spend $200 million to make a movie about how money corrupts. There was absolutely no human side shown in anti-heroes. It seemed like Billy Zane was playing a part of the devil. Casting was also very poor. If DiCaprio was 2 inches shorter than Winslet, you could swear she was his baby-sitter. The length of the movie was unnecessarily stretched to over 3 hours. First hour and the half was wasted on establishing the relationships between the characters that were known to audience long before they went to theater and the dialogue that was used to do so made it even worse. Hearing corny pick up lines such as \\\"I see you\\\" and \\\"This is my side of the ship\\\" generated more pain than the screams of drowning people. Also, jokes were too abundant and rather lame.  \\\"Titanic\\\" did involve some moving scenes such as the part when the musicians were playing while the ship was sinking but they were no way near anything original. The best thing about this film were its special effects, and that is the only thing that truly deserved an award.  Although this film lacked artistical value in overall sense, the public could not resist a sentimental story starring Romeo (DiCaprio), and so the movie became a success. Now it is safe to say that the industry will be less hesitant to invest large amounts of money in a single motion picture, so it seems that \\\"Titanic\\\" did achieve something after all.\"], \"review_score\": [7, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 8, 9, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10, 9, 10, 10, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1], \"review_category\": [\"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\", \"neg_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 7.3}, \"Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0025905\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Tombstone\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0108358\", \"total_review_count\": 1, \"total_rating_count\": 1, \"review_content\": [\"After finally viewing this movie in its entirety, I am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike. Is it the worst Western ever? No, I wouldn't say that. But \\\"the last great American Western\\\", a phrase I saw applied to it more than once? Not even close.  A movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clich\\u00e9d that I've ever seen. The movie can be measured in groaners per minute; as in, how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life? There's so many instances of this that it's distracting. Cheesy lines come at you in waves; predictable, unoriginal, and often.   If bad dialogue doesn't bother you, then how about bad gunfights? Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously. It's okay if there's a comic edge to such gunfighting, such as in Silverado, but in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good Westerns. The final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score, but by then, I was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving.  Other than those flaws, I can say the visuals are stunning - the movie's well shot and the settings all look great. The acting is passable, especially considering what the actors were given to work with.

The film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and I don't remember having seen it since. It has not (to my knowledge) been released on DVD or VHS although I shall browse around for a copy.  The film tells the story of three young people: two girls, one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger, and a young boy who go to live with their mother's brother and his young, mute Irish wife. His wife also has two brothers who live with them. The children's uncle is an unpleasant control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar whilst she watches a marionette show put on by him and her brothers in his toyshop.  The eldest girl and one of the Irishmen (the younger) develop a love for each other whilst they live in the same house. The girl helps her aunt out in the shop whilst her brother helps his uncle to make things in the workshop.  There are a lot of very disturbing elements to the film. There is the uncle's treatment of his wife as some kind of dumb (literally) possession (illustrated by the collar) whilst the Irish indulge dancing, drinking and somewhat forbidden love. Interestingly, though, I have seen far more explicit themes played out in other movies made in Hollywood today.  Makes you wonder whether the British film industry and the BBC have some kind of hidden agenda going on.  Still, despite it not being a children's movie, there are a lot of playful, magic moments in it and the one Irishman does some beautiful paintings.\"], \"review_score\": [4], \"review_category\": [\"neg_test\"], \"average_review_score\": 4.0}, \"Traffic\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0181865\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Trainspotting\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0117951\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0098382\", \"total_review_count\": 22, \"total_rating_count\": 22, \"review_content\": [\"I have been a huge fan of the original crew of the Enterprise since I was eight years old. I watched all the movies and appreciated each one for what they retained from the old series and for further developing the characters (and the Star Trek universe, in general). Even in \\\"The Undiscovered Country\\\" I thought the aging of the characters was well handled and the story worthy of a theatrical release. However, having said that, \\\"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\\\" is easily the worst of the series featuring the original crew. I agree with many that the camaraderie of Kirk, Spock and McCoy is well handled, but the overall script, the direction -- by William Shatner -- and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode. This is a \\\"buddy movie\\\" and, at times, almost unrecognizable as a Star Trek movie. The action sequences are not sustained and therefore, build little or no tension. The dialogue is weak though it does provide for a few laughs, both intended and not-intended. The Klingon's seem thrown in as an afterthought. The whole \\\"Sha-Ka-Ree\\\" concept is just silly and Laurence Luckinbill, a fine actor in everything else I've ever seen him in, boarders on the absurd in this movie. The scene where Sybok conjures up images of Spock's pain and McCoy's pain shatters the image of the characters as we've known them. Spock would never be party to such stupidity and McCoy, trying to save his father is full of insipid, redundant dialogue and totally wastes DeForest Kelley's acting abilities. The whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see from these characters. I understand that Shatner didn't have the luxury of working with ILM for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight, but that doesn't allow for such a bad story. In some respects, I think this story does fit in with the old series, but the movies, including \\\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\\" are all much better quality than this. It's a shame that most of the other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie. The focus on Kirk, McCoy and Spock is nice, but way over used. The old crew really seems to be out of character. I liked the old Klingon General and the sultry Romulan in the bar. I liked some of the humor and the idea that Spock has a half-brother, but that's about it. If this was a TV episode, I'd be able to accept a lot of the faults. As a movie, this is just bad, uninspired film making. It's a shame too, because I want this movie to be good. Even if it was the level of \\\"Star Trek III\\\" I would be happy, but this movie makes all the other movies in this series seem like works of Shakespeare.\", \"Welcome to the Plan 9 From Outer Space of Star Trek movies. Come on, trekkers, admit it. This movie is so bad, so staggeringly inept in every department, it's become something of a classic.  The Shat gives the worst performance ever committed to celluloid. \\\"BOONES! Hi, Bones\\\" Brilliant! This isn't just Ham - it's several large pig farms in Kentucky!   The \\\"Special\\\" Effects. Should be done under the trade descriptions act for using such a term. The Enterprise is a moving piece of cardboard in this film. Really! Even the Star Trek TV show had better.  Bones, Spock and The Shat sing! Yeah, Spock sings Row Row Row Your Boat. After struggling over the meaning of the words!!!! \\\"Capt. Life is Not A Dream\\\" Poor Leonard Nimoy, he must really want to strangle Shatner for this. Could The Shat not have given us his rendition of Mr. Tambourine Man, or harmonised with Nimoy on Ballad of Bilbo Baggins? Sorely disappointed.  A Sean Connery look-a-like plays Spock's half-brother. Only cos they couldn't get Sean Connery! Uhura does a fan dance! That would have been sexy in 1966. In 1989 it's like watching your drunk granny embarrass herself at a Christmas Party.  Cat Woman Jumps on Shatner's back! Shat twirls her around a few times like a WWF Wrestler, and chucks her off. Yayy The Shat! Seems Connery 2.0 was a bit of a Vulcan rebel. Which explains why Spock hasn't previously mentioned him in 79 t.v episodes and 4 movies. McCoy apparently mercy-killed his Dad, BUT AFTERWARDS THEY FOUND A CURE. Tell me this isn't hysterically funny.  The 11 deck Enterprise suddenly grows another 400 decks for an escape sequence in an elevator shaft. Spock's antigrav boots amazingly support Bones and The Shat as well. Should also have used em on the humped-back whales in Star Trek IV! Shatner meets God! Or what purports to be God, but I assume is really some kind of alien being. God looks a bit like Charlton Heston in The 10 Commandments. Sean Connery the 2nd calls on God to share his pain, and promptly dies. Or something. God punishes the Shat for questioning his identity. So Spock kills God with a photon torpedo. I'd love to know what Jehovah's Witnesses made of this scene.  The Shat, having killed God, promptly goes back to his sing-song with Spock and Bones. Altogether now, Row Row Row Your Boat.....\", \"I saw this movie just recently, and I said to myself: \\\"This movie is bad!\\\" William Shatner is a great actor, but he is no director!   It's not just that the acting is bad, it's terrible. And instead of a plot, we have a very bad storyline that is called a plot! What I really thought was bad was at the beginning where Kirk and McCoy were teaching Spock how to sing \\\"Row, Row, Row Your Boat!\\\"  Do I have something against William Shatner? I do not. But when it comes to being a director, he sucks! This film is not one of the worst movies I have ever seen. But it is the worst of the Star Trek series!   I noticed that after this Shatner did not return to direct another film in the series. They apparently did not want him to direct another film again after this happened!   Overall, this movie sucks!   2/10\", \"Man, this would have been a bad episode of the original series. I can't believe they actually spent money on this one... I caught the second half of this on tv and, having never seen this one before, thought I would watch it... Boy, what a waste of time... More cheese than Wisconsin!!!  \", \"The weakest of the 'old' crew Star Trek films, this film suffers from an awful script and obvious budget constraints, particularly in the mishandled finale. The bones of a good movie are here, and the directing from Shatner is not as bad as is commonly made out, but the characters end up speaking and acting way out of the style that the previous 3 films had carefully established. Lawrence Luckinbull is convincing as the renegade Vulcan with msyterious and mystical powers to influence people and these powers are responsible for some of the best scenes, particularly for Deforest Kelley who shines as 'Bones' McCoy in this his second last movie. However, as good as those scenes are, they ultimately do not advance the plot, and end up feeling as more of a distraction. A great score from the ever reliable Goldsmith and some funny scenes in Yosemite between the main three are not enough to cover the gaping chasms in the plot, and the frankly embarassing attempts at humour serve only to alienate even die hard trekkies. All in all, a wealth of possibilities which although it fails to deliver, has its moments. Watch out for the pool table in the bar brawl scene...\", \"That's the only word I can think of to describe this movie. Not waste as in a waste of time (any time spent with these characters is never wasted), but waste as in a waste of opportunities.  When I see this movie, I think of all the Star Trek novels that were written which would have made a much better film than the story Shatner chose. The setup was like an average television episode, while the finish felt like the climax (if you can call it that) of the first movie.  Nimoy, in directing II-IV, focused on the character of Spock--how he faced the Kobayashi Maru outside of the classroom, and how he handled his emotional live now that he had a chance to start fresh. Shatner could have done the same with Kirk here, but he didn't. We don't know much about Kirk that we didn't know before. Again, one of the novels would have been better--try \\\"My Enemy, My Ally\\\" for a very interesting character study of our friend James T. The minor characters are used mostly for cute bits, and the Scotty-Uhura subplot seems way out of left field, particularly since the subtext in the original series was Sulu-Uhura.  Even hardcore fans can't find much to enjoy here. Sorry, but it's true.\", \"Star Trek V definitely earns the dubious distinction of being the weakest film in the Star Trek series. Despite the good acting efforts by the actors, it suffered from a general lack of funding from Paramount Pictures. Paramount Pictures was not enthusiastic about this film at its very onset.  The movie begins with the Enterprise crew enjoying their extended shore leave as a reword for saving the Earth from total ecological disaster. Their shore leave is cut short when a disturbance occurs on Nimbus III, the Planet of Intergalactic Peace. Captain Kirk and the Enterprise arrive at Nimbus III only to have their ship hijacked by Sybok, Spock's half-brother. Sybok brainwashes the crew of the Enterprise and sets it on a suicide mission to rendezvous with \\\"God\\\" just past the Great Barrier at the center of our galaxy. Captain Kirk must then figure out a way to regain control of his ship and to fend off the Enterprise's Klignon pursuers.  The only bright spot in the film is the acting and directing. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Laurence Luckinbill, and the rest of the cast all give good performances. William Shatner also does a pretty good job directing this film.  However, the film suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding. First, the part of Sybok was initially offered to Sean Connery, but he refused. So, Laurence Luckinbill got the part. Second, many of the special effects were severely cut back ... reducing the movies entertaining potential. Third, the scene that depicts the arrival at the Great Barrier left much to be desired. Finally, the romance between Scotty and Uhura in this film did not make much sense at all ... considering that no such romance ever occurred prior to this point in the Star Trek universe and it was never explained how such a romance could suddenly materialize between Star Treks IV and V.  Overall, this is a very weak film. You should probably just skip this film and move on to Star Trek VI. After all, the cast and crew made Star Trek VI partly to bail themselves out after their debacle with Star Trek V.\", \"No one expects the Star Trek movies to be high art, but the fans do expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes. Unfortunately, this movie had a muddled, implausible plot that just left me cringing - this is by far the worst of the nine (so far) movies. Even the chance to watch the well known characters interact in another movie can't save this movie - including the goofy scenes with Kirk, Spock and McCoy at Yosemite.  I would say this movie is not worth a rental, and hardly worth watching, however for the True Fan who needs to see all the movies, renting this movie is about the only way you'll see it - even the cable channels avoid this movie.\", \"I'm aware that there are some fans who might like this movie. I'm aware that the idea of 'searching for god' might appear interesting to some, to me, however, it's really boring.  The movie is simply boring. When it does get a little bit interesting, it gets stupid. Come on... Kirk fights against god and wins? How low can we possibly get? The only good part in the film is the camping scene at the first 5 minutes, which is truly great, but after that, the movie becomes boring, irritating, with nothing more than a good music.  Thank god we have Star Trek VI. (Oops, Kirk beat him).\", \"I don't think I can add much more to what has already been said about this film. However, I can offer a small recollection from seeing ST-V in the theater. In the last (dreadful) scene, as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and it seems likely that the credits will start rolling at any second, the audience seemed to rise in unison. Normally, for a movie like this, at least -some- die-hard fans stay to watch right up until the final disclaimer. As the people filed out, I remember hearing no laughing and cheerful banter, only low murmurs.  I remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic said that it was so bad that only Trek fans would like it. What an idiot. The fans were the ones most apt to tear it apart first!  Favorite worst scene: Target shooting on a Voyager space probe, through a periscope no less! Space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought.\", \"While Star Trek the Motion Picture was mostly boring, Star Trek The Final Frontier is plain bad. In this terrible sequel, the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the Federation that ambassadors representing Earth, Romulus and Kronos (the Klingon home world) have been kidnapped by a renegade Vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier. There, he hopes to find God. Using mysticism and bad writing, he persuades many of the senior officers of the Enterprise to betray Kirk and get a hold of the ship. They do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god-like alien. This one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin. At the core is a good idea that is never really developed. The plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before. It is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. The action scenes don't have the suspense of Wrath of Kahn, the philosophy is boring, and the humor is stale. Now I will focus most of my anger on William Shatner. When he takes the director's chair, the ego gets bigger. Most of the focus is on him, Spock, and McCoy, but does not give the others enough to do. Moreover, whereas Shatner is usually guilty of over-acting in previous movies and television spots, he is just plain bad in this one. Now Kirk is reckless, a practical jokers, and silly. One of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song, \\\"Row Row Row your Boat\\\" in a round by a campfire. In any case, this is the worst of the Star Trek franchise. I should have given it three out of ten instead of five.\", \"Even not being a fan of the \\\"Star Trek\\\" movies or universe of shows and books and such, I still find some enjoyment in some of the movies featuring the old cast and in the case of \\\"First Contact\\\" even the new cast a bit. This one though was kind of sad to watch...it seemed to want to be so much, but it failed on so many levels to be one of the worst Star Trek movies. The plot is very far fetched seeming to want to combine three or four stories into one ultimate Trek adventure, but it ends up an unfunny when it tries to be, not tense when it wants to be and not action packed like it tries to be mess of inconsistencies. The whole movie to take a phrase from Spock is illogical. The effects are nothing special as I have seen episodes of Next Generation that are just as good, which is to say it is fine for a television show, but not a major motion picture. The plot is laughable as the gang at first tries to stop Spock's brother then joins him on his quest to find God, yes you read that correctly. The Klingons make a tacked on appearance, which actually will set up the much better Undiscovered Country movie. All in all you know it is bad when the best part of the film is Kirk, Bones and Spock singing row your boat, well Spock was not really singing, but rather questioning the lyrics.\", \"Leonard Nimoy directed Star Trek III, which wasn't half bad. Maybe William Shatner thought seeming as how Nimoy did it he could. After seeing this film he should have reversed that decision.  Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series. The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards. She looked like she was taking part in a granny competition. If they meant to make her look sexy. They were wrong. She looked grotesque.  How this got to production or even written...well it dosen't bear thinking about. The only place good for this film is in the garbage. The worst one of the series.\", \"When I first saw it 9 years ago, when I was 9. I thought it stunk. I'm 18 now and I still think it stinks. I mean geez no Special effects or anything, it was boring and kinda anti-climatic. My cousin watched once and George Takai (Sulu) kept talking about how it was supposed to be so much better, but they kept cutting to the budget. It would have been a great episode, but it was a terrible movie.\", \"Supposedly, director William Shatner had in mind a much 'darker' film when it came to 'Star Trek V: The Final Frontier' but the suits at Paramount, looking at the huge box-office receipts taken in by its humor-filled predecessor, insisted the new film have plenty of laughs too. So what we get is arguably the weakest and goofiest of the six Star Trek movies with the original cast. There are bad ideas aplenty, along with a few good ones, and if you're in a charitable mood, you could look at 'The Final Frontier' the same way you would a so-so episode of the TV series. On the plus side, Laurence Luckenbill is a fine actor and gives one of the best 'guest star' performances in any Star Trek, big or small screen, ranking right up there with William Windom's Commodore Decker. His portrayal of Sybok, Spock's half-brother, consistently lifts the film when it threatens to sink, which happens all too frequently. Charles Cooper is good too as the fat old Klingon General Korrd; too bad his role isn't as large as he is. If the story about Shatner's intentions is true, then I owe him an apology, because I was prepared to lay the blame for the incessant silliness and not-very-convincing action scenes squarely at his directorial feet. The reason is I've always felt that, of all the Trek regulars, Shatner was the least 'tuned-in' to everything that makes Star Trek work and what makes it special to its fans. Having read his Trek memoirs, it's very apparent to me that he considered the show another action-adventure series that just happened to have a science-fiction setting. He preferred the vision of Gene Coon over that of Gene Roddenberry; Coon was known for his work on the popular western series, 'The Wild Wild West.' Shatner also mentioned that a favorite Star Trek episode of his was 'A Piece of the Action,' a silly second-season episode co-written by Coon. So, finally given an opportunity to direct a Star Trek feature film, would not Shatner follow his instincts and produce an action-filled flick with lots of tongue-in-cheek humor? Well somebody did, because that's what 'The Final Frontier' ended up being. Shatner himself definitely returns to form as The Great Ham and, as Leonard Maltin points out, the film suffers from a bad case of 'the cutes.' In the opening scene at Yosemite National Park, it's hard to say which is worse, the super-cheesy special effects or the godawful dialogue. Running gags about equipment malfunctioning on the Enterprise have run all the way from 'Wrath of Khan' and by this, the fifth Trek movie, have run themselves into the ground. So has the idea of a 'skeleton crew'. One new development is an apparent romantic relationship between Scotty and Uhura and suffice it to say one does not exactly sense flames of passion burning between the two. It's a pointless subplot and adds nothing. The climactic scene where 'God' is encountered doesn't add much either; whether or not this was a good idea in the first place is debatable, but the scene itself doesn't make much sense. (The 'God' creature's abilities seem to vary according to what is needed at the moment.) Roughly half of this is a tired retread of the climax from 'The Search for Spock.' Leonard Nimoy manages to salvage Spock's integrity, even while spouting such un-Spock-like lines as \\\"Get a grip on yourself, Doctor.\\\" And DeForest Kelley, as usual, outperforms both Shatner and Nimoy; he really came on as an actor in the final Trek films. So this Trek outing isn't terrible, it just isn't very good. There was to be one more original cast Trek movie before the baton was passed to the 'next generation,' and it was far better suited to the task than 'Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.'\", \"The voyage here is a search for God, the big guy in the sky, the big cheese with a beard. Cunningly disguised as the thirst for ultimate knowledge. Taking over from Leonard Nimoy in the directing chair is The Shat himself, Captain Tiberius William Shatner Kirk. In an attempt at blending the fun corny aspects of the series with sci-fi histrionics {Klingon dialogue consultant, really?}, Shatner and his co-writers have only achieved what is almost an embarrassing parody of a parody. Where's the danger,? where's the brothers in arms spirit,? in fact where is our badly underwritten crew?. Star Trek humour is a wonderful thing, when it's in the right places and done with a straight lace so befitting what has come before The Final Frontier. Some light moments exist, but they do not compensate for the lack of serious moments. While do we really need another Spock revelation,? really?.  Some nice sets and little knowingly Trek moments aside, The Final Frontier is just a bad movie experience. 3/10\", \"... Once. \\\"Manos, the Hands of Fate.\\\" That was worse than this, quite a bit worse: but it did have one thing: it had beautiful women in negligees wresting each other -- for about 20 minutes. This has a fat 45 year-old with 3 tits and a tail, in a cantina scene cloned directly from \\\"Star Wars.\\\" Not to mention an obese, blue seductress Uhura, her fat legs and ass hanging out of some sort of insane bird costume, in this Method Acting Mess. She always wanted to perform before a \\\"captive audience\\\"? She must have meant the poor slobs who shelled out 8 bucks hoping to see another \\\"Wrath of Khan,\\\" or at least a \\\"Voyage Home.\\\" Captive\\\" is right. I wonder how many people in the theaters tried to slit their wrists while crying out: \\\"mother, make it stop.\\\"  No question about it, \\\"Final Frontier\\\" is not just an unmitigated disaster, it's cruel and unusual punishment. This is Star Trek from hell. This is Shatner on mushrooms -- or maybe peyote. This is Where No Man Has Gone Before and Wished He Never Had in the First Place. Or, to paraphrase a review of \\\"Heaven's Gate: \\\"It's as if Gene Roddenberry sold his soul to the Devil for the success of a TV series, and Devil is just now coming around to collect.\\\"  And don't even get me started on a drunken Kirk and a grinning McCoy singing \\\"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\\\" together, like they were lovers in some sort of demented gay fever dream. Then we've got the Hideous Dynamic Duo of Sulu and Chekov, hiking through the woods together... probably en route to a Barry Manilow concert. Then there's Laurence Luckinbill as Spock's brother???!!! Yeah, right! Amazing how these relations we never heard of suddenly crawl out of the woodwork when we need a new plot line. And not to forget Spock rocketing through the air after Kirk when he falls from a cliff in Yosemite. Sure. He catches up to Kirk and saves him ONE FOOT away from the ground. Where'd you get those nifty Rocket Shoes, Spock?!\", \"I guess that after Leonard Nimoy had been successful in directing \\\"the Search for Spock\\\" and \\\"the Voyage Home,\\\" William Shatner thought he could direct too. Although he is a competent actor, he shows here that he's just not a good director.  Actually, this movie is hard evidence to support the arguments of Trekkies who say that William Shatner being an arrogant egomaniac. For although his character, Captain James Kirk, was always arguably the most important role in the original \\\"Star Trek,\\\" it seems in this movie that he is the heart of the movie, the two other most important characters, Captain Spock and Doctor Leonard McCoy, are just there to support him, and the other characters are just there to add comic relief.  The plot is that some emotional Vulcan outcast named Sybok is mindmelding with people and releasing the pain bottled up inside them from that traumatic event early in life that changed them forever. Grateful, they join him in his quest to make the entire world free of pain and thus at peace. Sybok and his followers commandeer the building in which a peace conference between a Human, Klingon, and Romulan diplomat is taking place. This lures the still-being-constructed Enterprise there, since none of Starfleet's other ships have \\\"experienced commanders\\\" (honestly, with how Starfleet is run, the Klingons and Romulans should have conquered them years ago). Sybok adds the Enterprise's crew, save Spock (who is revealed to be secret brothers with Sybok), McCoy, and Kirk. Sybok orders that the Enterprise take off to \\\"the center of the universe\\\" to meet \\\"God,\\\" who apparently every race has a word for. However, it turns out that this is only a minor entity when he demands the use of the Enterprise and Kirk asks, \\\"what does God need with a starship.\\\" The entity is destroyed, but not before Sybok, realizing he's been lied to for years, sacrifices his life and earns Spock's respect in death after the Enterprises photon torpedos destroy the entity and inexplicably Sybok as well.  OK, science fiction movies are not known for realism, but at some point, rationality must be enforced. Why do people follow Sybok just for releasing their pain? Why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event? I've certainly led a trauma-free life. Why doesn't Kirk try his crew for mutiny and treason after they join Sybok? What was the point of Sybok sacrificing himself when the torpedos were going to kill the entity anyway?  So the plot's weak. Another problem is that Sybok, though played well by Lawrence Luckinbill, is poorly portrayed. Just because he's an emotional Vulcan doesn't mean he should act exactly like a Human religious fanatic. Shatner (who was a co-writer as well as the director) could have at least developed dialog fitting for an emotional Vulcan. I guess he feels that any emotional being talks like us. Gee, I guess that means that Klingons should say \\\"isn't\\\" and \\\"don't\\\" more often than \\\"is not\\\" and \\\"do not.\\\" And the Cardassians shouldn't prolong their sentences because they like to talk (yeah, I know it's sad that I know this). Please... every ST race uses unique dialog. Why is Sybok the exception.  The only thing to not complain about is the acting. I've always known \\\"Star Trek\\\" to have great actors, and this movie is not exception. Cudos also go to Leonard Nimoy, for it had to be difficult to play the dispassionate Spock in his old age.  Some other things I didn't like:  Shatner and the late DeForrest Kelly twice show what bad singers they are by singing \\\"Row, Row, Row your Boat\\\" in this movie. I guess Shatner wished to silence his detractors of his singing ability. What he did was prove their point.  Uhura does a fan dance while wearing nothing but tree bark to draw some men into a booby trap. After all, the dreams of all us men are filled with images of middle-aged plump women dancing naked.  Comedy's all well and good as long as it doesn't affect the nature of \\\"Star Trek\\\" too much, but when Scotty bumps into an object on the Enterprise and KOs himself, it's kinda goin' overboard.  Kirk is the only crew member who can reject Sybok's offer of releasing their inner pain and see through the God imposter's deception. Not even Spock can manage either of these? Perhaps this scenes were valantines from Shatner to his character, as many suspect.  The concept of an entity posing as God had been used in \\\"Star Trek\\\" before this movie more than once. Be creative, Shatner.  Speaking of uncreativeness, I didn't purticularly care for the ripping off of the music of \\\"Star Trek: the Next Generation.\\\"  All in all, pretty bad \\\"Trek\\\" movie. If you're a Trekkie, watch it once because it's \\\"Star Trek.\\\" Otherwise, watch \\\"Star Trek II: the Wrath of Khan.\\\" It's way better.\", \"This was so bad I can't even review it. So I'll jot some sentences about what I witnessed, and it'll be up to you to decide.   Captain Kirk, with toupee and tubby gut, is rock climbing Yosemete's El Capitan. Spock meets him halfway riding on a floating skateboard-like hovercraft. Kirk falls. Spock flies down, catches him inches before Kirk hits the ground head- first.   Later, that night, Spock, Kirk and McCoy are eating beans around a campfire. Spock likes the beans. Then, Kirk and McCoy sing \\\"Row Row Row Your Boat\\\", and want Spock to join in on the three-way harmony. Spock doesn't want to sing. And later that night, he disagrees. \\\"But life isn't but a dream, Captain\\\". Should I go on?   Okay... A renegade Vulcan, who happens to be Spock's half brother, leads a revolt on a sandy planet - taking hostages. The crew of the enterprise land on the planet, and Uhura, pushing fifty-five and weighing two-hundred some-odd pounds, lures the natives with her bare legs. But they can't trick the brother, who claims he can find God.   He kidnaps the crew and the Enterprise. They go to a planet where a big bearded apparition, claiming to be God, spits fire at Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. Spock's sibling, realizing it isn't God - but is really a form of himself - or something - joins with the apparition in order to destroy it and... sparks fly.   Then, after stuff happens too complicated to explain involving Klingons who resemble Lorenzo Lamas...   The Three Amigos - Kirk, Spock and McCoy - return to Yosemite (did I mention, Kirk was wearing a GO CLIMB A ROCK T-shirt?). With Spock playing some kind of funky Vulcan guitar, they sing \\\"Row Row Row Your Boat\\\", this time all three harmonizing as the credits roll.\", \"I find it almost touching how Star Trek fans try desperately to like this film in spite of its unbelievable number of flaws.  To begin with, none of the familiar characters are really in character so to speak. Scotty is depicted as a bumbling tinkerer instead of the competent engineer he was in the original series. Uhura...Gods, I can't even think about what they did to her character. All of her dialog was painful to listen to. McCoy seemed like a neurotic stepfather to Kirk instead of his trusted friend. Spock...well, let's just say that Leonard Nimoy was terribly wasted. He was given bad dialog (\\\"I do not believe you have grasped the gravity of your situation Captain.\\\" Gravity, get it? Get it?) and made almost into a buffoon. Kirk...oh man, don't get me started. William Shatner is a hammy actor to begin with, so to allow him to direct really is to invite disaster which is what we got.  The plot is beyond ridiculous. Giving Spock a brother is a pretty desperate story line and unnecessarily soap operaish. But hey, let's go with it. The search for God. Again, a weak plot basis. You don't think so? OK, let's go with that too. So assuming that the two aforementioned plot elements are sound, what's wrong with the script? Well, for one thing, it recycles way too much. The Enterprise, for example, is yet again, not working properly. Are we to assume that Starfleet would send a grossly malfunctioning ship with a skeleton crew into a potentially dangerous situation just because they want James Kirk to handle the situation? If that's the case, then why not put him on a better ship as an adviser? Adding to that...the crew is grossly incompetent. Scotty has the ship in pieces (and apparently is cloddish enough to bump his head knocking himself into unconsciousness WHILE there are hostiles on board!), no one seem to notice the Klingon ship decloaking at a crucial moment (despite the fact that the sensors are clearly showing the ship in weapons range) and the crew all seem way too familiar with each other. In other words, there is no sense of discipline. If this is the flagship of Starfleet, then it's a wonder that the Klingons hadn't already overthrown the Federation.  As to the personal struggles with pain, it was crap. Lawrence Luckenbill is a competent actor, but even he couldn't save this turkey. In short no one could. Of all the people involved, I imagine Leonard Nimoy is the most embarrassed by it. I hope he is, anyway.  Thank god the original cast didn't bow out on this cloddish opus.\", \"What is it with studios like Paramount that have a proven hit film series on their hands, and figure it can screw around with the budget and formula? Paramount spent less on this film than they did on TMP, which doesn't sound bad until you realize that there's a 10 gap between when the films were made. The $40 TMP cost to make would be equivalent to about $75 million in 1989. This film is the reason that Shatner has never been given a fair chance to direct other films, as well. Every time he turned around, the studio was slashing the budget and making demands regarding the storyline. The fact that this was the one storyline that Roddenberry and Shatner could agree upon for the most part made the freshman directorial task tough enough, but after all the machinations were done, all anyone ended up with was an uneven story and a load of badly executed special effects not worthy of the original series, much less a major motion picture. The most glaring examples: - All of the Phaser effects were severely ashed out and fake-looking. - The shot of the Enterprise going into the great barrier was so obviously a still-frame shot being zoomed away from. At least the popsicle stick that held the Enterprise cut out up was successfully matted out. - God \\\"chasing\\\" Kirk up the mountain... Egads, they may as well have just cut in shots of Godzilla climbing the volcano at the end of \\\"Godzilla 1985,\\\" and used thumbtacks to scratch the emulsion off of the film to make electric bolts come out of his eyes at the imperiled Captain Kirk.... Yes, friends, I have a real problem with the look of that last scene, especially.  Thank goodness Star Trek VI was such a redeemer of a film...\", \"I like underdogs. So, 12 years after having first seen Star Trek V, and thinking it was bizarrely bad, I gave it a second watch, hoping I would find some redeeming quality which I missed the first time around.  I didn't.  The writing is half-baked, and although at first the quality of the acting is stable enough to keep the movie on its feet (albeit shakily), the further we get into the plot the sillier it gets. The last quarter of the film is just plain ridiculous. What was even worse, from the original cast's POV, is that this was the first ST movie to be released AFTER the franchise returned to television with Next Generation, and the average episode of Next Generation would put this to shame* - including the special effects! What an embarrassment.

Instead of most movies (where the filmmaker is some director-for-hire that is paid to feature a star or two), you can feel Terry Gilliam's presence through the experience. \\\"12 Monkeys\\\" is evidence of Gilliam's own vision and style, as opposed to making offbeat movies for their own sake. \\\"12 Monkeys\\\" is a variation on similar themes of Gilliam's repertoire:oppressive/recessive societies, the solitude of the protagonist, the frustration associated with disbelief, and parallel realms. In this film Gilliam does a fine job of blurring lines between the two realms, using ambiguities to force the audience to believe rather than know. This tendency for Gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gaps leads to criticisms of art-house pretentiousness. The difference between Gilliam and artsy posers is that Gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all of his images have meaning. The two nearly identical bathing scenes of Cole in the beginning are meant to draw comparisons which leave the audience unsettled. His bald head is a mark of uniformity in the disease-ridden future world, yet makes him recognizable in the 1996 world. The title itself is a mark of Gilliam's creativity, as it requires the majority of the story to flesh out for its meaning to be fully understood. All in all, Gilliam's dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch yet also require thought and interpretation from the audience. The film has immense re-watch value, since there are subtle details and hints that can be missed upon the first viewing. Definitely one of my favorites.\", \"Time paradoxes are the devil's snare for underemployed minds. They're fun to consider in a 'what if?' sort of way. Film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including 'Star Trek: First Contact', the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure', 'Groundhog Day' and the Stargate SG1 homage, 'Window of Opportunity'. Heinlein's 'All You Zombies' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time.  In the case of Terry Gilliam's excellent film, '12 Monkeys', it's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re-think our conception of the film. Repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind.  Some, seeing the film for the first time, will regard Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as a schizophrenic. Most will see Cole as a man disturbed by what Adams describes as 'the continual wrenching of experience' visited upon him by time travel.  Unlike other time travel stories, '12 Monkeys' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that time cannot be changed, but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists AFTER he has been sent back to 1996, in his own personal time-line.  Even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time-line universe, in order to ensure that the time-line is not altered...Cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realised. If that's the case, time is like a fluid, it always finds its own level or path, irrespective of the external forces working on it. It boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much.  If you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time, as we see on board the plane at the end of the film, then that means the future CAN be changed by manipulating past events...or does it? The film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians.  Bonus material on the DVD makes for very interesting viewing. Gilliam was under more than normal pressure to bring the film in under budget, which is no particular surprise after the 'Munchausen' debacle and in light of his later attempt to film 'Don Quixote'. I would rate the 'making of' documentary as one of the more interesting I've seen. It certainly is no whitewash and accurately observes the difficulties and occasional conflict arising between the creative people involved. Gilliam's description of the film as his \\\"7\\u00bdth\\\" release, on account of the film being written by writers other than himself - and therefore, not really 'his' film' - doesn't do the film itself justice.  Brad Pitt's portrayal of Goines is curiously engaging, although his character is not especially sympathetic. Watch for his slightly wall-eyed look in one of the scenes from the asylum. It's disturbing and distracting.  Probably a coincidence, the Louis Armstrong song 'What a Wonderful World' was used at the end of both '12 Monkeys' and the final episode of the TV series of 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. Both the film and the TV series also featured British actor Simon Jones.  '12 Monkeys' is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that the mental stimulation of a game of chess may entertain. It's not a mindless recreation, that's for sure.\", \"Twelve Monkeys is an insane time-travelling, action packed movie that stars Bruce Willis who plays James Cole, a man who is sent back in time to collect information about the devastating plague that ensues in November of 1996. Unfortunately, he is sent back too far to the year 1990 where everyone believes that he is insane.  This movie is thrilling and has great acting performances from Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twelve monkeys is one of the greatest time travelling movies that I believe anybody can enjoy.

When he tell him that scientists had already got his message and know someone else would spread the virus. And they two together meet Kathryn when Kathryn tell James the true man is DR. Goines assistant. So it is clearly Jose also get the true information about the virus,(James keep an eye on him at the time remember?) and he has teeth. So why everything is still happen??

The script is totally crazy with some easy tricks on it but it's quite entertaining and Gilliam proves that he's got imagination (the futuristic scenes are just great). As for the cast, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (whatever happened to her??) are just OK, but Brad Pitt is so annoying, whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and he's not credible at all.

The story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about. The climactic scene is beautifully magnificent, and the last lines fit perfectly. The scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way. Lots of dark humour on display here. Fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography. In my top ten.\", \"\\\"Twelve Monkeys\\\" is odd and disturbing, yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time. It cleverly jumps between future and the past, and the story it tells is about a man named James Cole, a convict, who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996. At first Cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly who tries to help him and a patient named Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist. Being provocative and somehow so sensible, dealing with and between reason and madness, the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films.  The story is just fantastic. It's so original and so entertaining. The screenplay itself written by David and Janet Peoples is inspired by a movie named \\\"La Jet\\u00e9e\\\" (1962) which I haven't seen, but I must thank the director and writer of the movie, Chris Marker, for giving such an inspiration for the writers of \\\"Twelve Monkeys\\\". I read a little about \\\"La Jet\\u00e9e\\\", it's not the same story but it has the same idea, so this is not just a copy of it. David and Janet Peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story, which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end. The music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it's so compelling, composed by Paul Buckmaster.  Terry Gilliam, who we remember from Monty Python, as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me, as I really never thought him as a director type of a person. I know he has directed movies before, but I really couldn't believe that he could make something this magnificent. It shouldn't be a surprise though, as he does an amazing job. You can still sense that same weirdness as in the Python's, but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing. Yes, it is indeed odd, weird, bizarre and disturbing, so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too, so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through. It's not as heavy as you could imagine, but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch. Despite that, the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks, dreams, jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn't even make the plot messy in any part, though it does need concentration from the viewer after all.  What comes to acting, well the movie doesn't even go wrong there. The role of James Cole is played by the mighty Bruce Willis, who probably does his best role performance yet to date. Now people may disagree with me, as he did some fine job in for example \\\"The Sixth Sense\\\" as well, but for me the role of James Cole was so ideal for Willis and he performs it incredibly well. The character is very well written too, yet performed even better. Cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself, starting to question his actual time of living, trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle. By hardship he starts to loose his faith, questioning if he can even trust or believe himself. Other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of Madeleine Stow and Brad Pitt. Stow plays the role of Kathryn Railly, the psychiatrist of James Cole, who sees something strangely familiar in Cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness. She somehow starts to believe Cole's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things. Brad Pitt is so good in the role of Jeffrey Goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date. The insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought Pitt even an Oscar nomination for it, so I guess I'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing.  All in all, \\\"Twelve Monkeys\\\" is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone, especially for the sci-fi fans. It includes brilliant characters and superb role performances, especially from Willis and Pitt, and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that's so intelligent and clever. Yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer's attention by making it interesting and witty. It's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too, so it's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures I've ever seen. Through the odd yet terrific vision of Terry Gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride. Hard to explain really, but that's how it is, it's mind blowing.\", \"I really enjoyed this -- I'm a big fan of movies that mess with your mind and leave you with a lot of questions and ideas to debate, and this was a stellar example. But then, Terry Gilliam is always good at that (well, almost always. Let's just forget about Jabberwocky and The Brothers Grimm, shall we?).  I particularly liked the way it handled the time travel theme and the avoidance of paradoxes -- the way events in the past and future intertwined and fed into each other.  It was also really well done aesthetically -- the art direction was really great, and I wish I'd been able to see it on the big screen. The future scenes had a similar feel to Brazil in a lot of ways, and even the present scenes were often really visually compelling.  But perhaps the most striking thing about it was that it featured two actors I normally don't much like, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and they both delivered amazing performances here. Pitt especially -- I'd seen one or two films before that made me realize he could in fact actually act (contrary to what I'd originally thought), but this one really outdid them. I actually found myself asking my friends at one point \\\"Are you SURE that's Brad Pitt?\\\" This is probably the most memorable performance of his career (though admittedly that may not be saying too much).\", \"Terry Gilliam gives a stunning movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt and even the small appearance of Christover Plummer makes the movie absolutely brilliant! This is the only Terry Gilliam film I've seen, and Twelve Monkeys is definitely in my top 10. I think this is one of the four best Bruce Willis movies; and Brad Pitt's best. Brad Pitt delivers a perfect performance. Possibly one of the ten best actor's performance that I've ever seen. He played his role (Geoffrey) very convincingly. Bruce Willis' role (James Cole) was also quite convincing. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt acted extraordinarily well. With the brilliant story to back the great performances; and to back that up, Terry Gilliam's superb directing.\", \"The story of this film is truly remarkable. A virus cut loose and only 1% of the human race survived. The only thing we know now is that animals rule the land above and there are posters everywhere that say, \\\"The Twelve Monkeys did it.\\\" Thats right, the human race had to hide underground from the sickness that had killed over 500 Billion people. Apparently animals do not contract this disease. Day by day the present scientist try to discover what type of sickness had caused this; how it was created; if nature did it or a mere human being had created it. All they know is that there is are a bunch of animals running around a city above them, the deaths began during 1996-1997, and twelve monkeys have something to do with it. (Or at least thats what the poster says.) So a current convict named James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent as a \\\"volunteer\\\" to get some samples from above. After he does his \\\"volunteer\\\" work, he is asked to be sent back in time to the year 1996 to figure out what happened to the world. Cole accepts and the story of the Twelve Monkeys begin.  Throughout the story the time machine gets the dates wrong quite a few times, from 1990, to some time during the 1950's. (In a middle of a war.) Throughout the time traveling back and forth, it starts to mess James up in the head and that twist the story up. The whole story is very well done and I would of gave it a higher grade if it wasn't for the ending. I personally didn't like the ending of the movie and I was very disappointed. I just was expecting a more explaining ending then what had happen, but it isn't everyone who thinks this way. So I gave it a 8, but if everyone had the same opinion as me I would give it a 6 or 7.  For the whole acting of the film, I give it a A+. Bruce Willis is great for this role and he acts good, but Brad Pitt is completely 100% excellent. His acting is so great, he gets into the character so well. I never really cared for Brad Pitt in till I saw him in this and Fight Club. There characters or similar in this film, he is just a little more... insane in this film. So overall I think this film is completely worth checking out. For most people it's a great science fiction film, I just don't think it is a masterpiece.\", \"First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you'll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same. His character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far... and counting. The story begins in the (not so far) future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth. The story seems to go towards SF but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. About that. Movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you'll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down. Its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good. But that doesn't mean that the ending wont pull your nerves, cause its pretty good. As far as the direction goes, it is prefect. Movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better. So, if you are getting ready to see a Sci-Fi movie or some action, you'll miss it. B There should be more movies like this.\", \"A great addition to anyone's collection.  12 monkeys is a movie you don't see every day. It has excellent actors to go with a excellent story. This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis but he holds the role like he holds John McClane.  The virus-kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors story is not a new one but the story takes a fresh new direction on it.  A man(Bruce)is sent back in time to get information on a virus which has wiped out most of man kind.  The actors in this were awesome. I must give a mention to Brad Pitt who was hilarious as the mental patient James Cole(Bruce) meets in a mental hospital.  The director did an amazing job on bringing us a disturbing picture of a future devastated by a man-made virus.  The animals seen in the virus world made it feel like they run the world when humans are driven into underground facilities.  This movie was excellent and must see and also its a must own.  I very much highly recommend it.  10/10\", \"I can't decide whether this is one of my favourite movies. It is a good thriller and has an emotional core but still I can't decide. I definitely liked it. This is the first movie of Terry Gilliam that I have seen. My first impression? I was engaged till the very end and it is not all that complex(to be confusing).  The movie is set in the future. A man James Cole(Bruce Willis) is sent from the future in order to get some information from the past(1996 to be specific). A virus killed 5 billion people. He is sent from the future to get some information about it. Also involved here are a psychiatrist called Kathryn Railly. The love story is portrayed beautifully and you can really feel the longing in this love and longing for a regular life. The loose ends are tied up in a very interesting manner at the end.  One thing I liked about this movie is that unlike other post-apocalyptic movies, the movie didn't prefer to give any boring social commentary and instead focused on this one guy and his longing for a regular life. \\\"You want to see the ocean, be with her\\\" is especially a poignant line in this movie. It chooses to focus on the tension and confusion in the person's mind. Therefore this is not exactly post apocalyptic movie but instead it could be described as a romantic sci fi movie with themes that range from time travel to blurred realities and so on. This is what makes this movie a special movie of the 1990's. The complex plot flows smoothly without adding too many characters.  The performances are quite good. Bruce willis surprised me here as he didn't act the regular tough guy here but he gave a good performance of a confused man who is in love. His desperation in certain sequences is portrayed beautifully. I have to check out his other movies. The gorgeous Madeleine Stowe is quite a treat to watch. EVer since I saw this movie, I have become so obsessed with her. She has given a great performance of a woman who sympathises with her patient and finally falls in love with him. Brad Pitt is the real surprise though with his portrayal of a crazy man named Jeffrey Goines. His Oscar nominated performance is quite surprising considering that he doesn't have many critics who have kind words for him.  The end is quite chilling and that is also another reason to watch the movie. The length or complexity is not as big a problem because this film is quite fast moving and there are enough incidents to keep people interested. And every incident in this movie has a meaning and nothing is there that is unnecessary.  Good thriller 10/10\", \"I just bought the DVD and i must say, (after seeing Brazil and Fear an loathing in Las Vegas) Terry does it again. As well of being a fan of the Monty Python movies, Terry Gilliam's genius follows through in this sci fi thriller, whom Bruce Willis plays a wonderful role as James Cole, and as well (perhaps my favorite character) Brad Pitt who played the insanity of Jefferey Goines. A must have for sci fi fans, or movie fan of any type really, because it includes suspense, drama, action, etc.   any way the plot, In the future, 1% of the world's population survives a disease intended to wipe out the human race, which is unleashed in the past by \\\"the army of twelve monkeys\\\". James Cole( Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1996 (which is when the virus was unleashed) to find out about the disease, so scientists in his time can find a cure. Before i go further, James Cole lives in an underground society, and the animals rule the world on the surface due to the disease that will kill the humans. anyway when he is sent back in time he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution because of his tellings to people of the virus. During his stay he meets Jefferey Goins( Brad Pitt) who is later mostly responsible for wiping out the human race. He also meets his psychiatrist ((Madelein Stowe) who eventually teams up with Bruce to save the world ( as she sees that he is correct in his tellings), he is sent back and forth from his time to the past and eventually sent to 1996 where he then questions his own sanity but later pulls through to reveal a suspenseful end quarter of the movie and later builds up to the somewhat shocking climax, where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus( not actually Brad Pitt) and is instead shot by the police as the killer gets away.\", \"NB: Spoilers within. This great movie is \\\"about\\\" so many things, all of them successfully: sci-fi time travel, unstable psychologies, dystopian society, the what-is-real syndrome, gradual undermining of belief systems, worldwide bioterrorism, and a nascent love story.  The ramifications of the story's twisted time line stir up loads of heated debate - witness the discussions within this site; or, as an extreme, check out the dissertation at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. Whew! Such temporal emphasis speaks mostly to the brilliant plot, coming from the magnificent work of writers David and Janet Peoples, not to mention the inspiration of Chris Marker's \\\"La Jetee.\\\" Without a doubt, this is one of the most successful, fascinating time-travel movies ever conceived. But there are many other levels speaking here.  The movie's real genius is to focus on the nasty side effects of time-travel in the mind of James Cole (Bruce Willis, doing the best work of his career here). His journey progresses from gung-ho vaccine-hunting warrior to gradually unhinged victim \\u0096 and back again. The other broad sweep of the story increasingly emphasizes the personal tale between James and Dr. Kathryn Railly (the wonderful Madeleine Stowe). I love the simultaneous shifting/opposing viewpoints of these two characters. For me it all comes to a head in the fleabag hotel room scene. By this point, James \\u0096 once gripped by an unshakable determination \\u0096 now slumps in utter doubt about his own reality; while Dr. Railly \\u0096 the cool and rational scientist \\u0096 has finally become wildly convinced, after absorbing James's proofs, of his horrific predictions. Her desperation to get through to James and hang on to the mission shows how far she's come.  Gilliam makes us care about these characters, especially through the crescendo of tension threading their lives. The balance held between emotional roller-coaster and mounting sci-fi puzzle/thriller is exquisite. And the denouement at the airport is heart-poundingly intense because we see it coming so clearly through James's dreams. It is here, just after James has decided to quit the whole mess \\u0096 and is fighting his insanity more than ever \\u0096 that he steps back up to the plate and does what is necessary for mankind. See Jose and the gun\\u0085 (Just before this, the references to Hitchcock's \\\"Vertigo\\\" and identity switching/confusion are brilliant.) This is a movie to be hashed out between thinking people; it not only holds up under repeated viewings, it demands them. \\\"Twelve Monkeys\\\" is intelligent, provocative, bizarre, funny, and suspenseful stuff.  The supporting cast is excellent, especially Brad Pitt stealing all of his scenes and showing great flexibility as Jeffery Goines, crazed and spoiled, but ever the survivor. And there is David Morse as Dr. Peters (interesting how the movie simply leaves to the viewer his wicked motivation) and Christopher Plummer as Dr. Goines. But the biggest accolades belong to Terry Gilliam, surpassing here - just barely - his outstanding \\\"Brazil.\\\" (Lots of parallels, of course, especially the lonely combatant trying to escape his crumbling surroundings: lunacy within, lunacy without.) Every frame of this movie has his unique stamp and tone. The soundtrack is terrific, too.  This is one of the great achievements of the 90s, a true favorite of mine, and sure to hold up for a long time to come.\", \"Normally I try to avoid Sci-Fi movies as much as I can, because this just isn't a genre that really appeals to me. Light sabers, UFO's, aliens, time traveling... most of the time it's nothing for me. However, there is one movie in the genre that I'll always give a place in my list of top movies and that's this \\\"Twelve Monkeys\\\" I remember to be completely blown away by it the first time, but even now, after having it seen several times already, I'm still one of its biggest fans. Every time I see it, this movie seems to get better and better.  Somewhere in the distant future all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996, leaving only 1 percent of the population alive. James Cole is one of them. He's a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a 'volunteer' to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. They believe it was spread by a mysterious group called 'The Twelve Monkeys' and need the virus before it mutated, so that scientists can study it. But their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert...  What I like so much about this movie is the fact that it is never clear whether all what you are seeing is real or not. Is this just an illusion, created in the mind of a mentally ill man or is it real? Does he really come from the future and can he really travel through time? Was the population really wiped out by a virus, released by the army of The Twelve Monkeys? Those are all questions that will leave you wondering from the beginning until the end. If the makers of this movie had chosen to make it all more obvious, I'm sure that I would never have liked it as much as I did now. It's just that mysteriousness that keeps me interested time after time. But that's not the only good thing about this movie of course. The acting is amazing too. Normally I'm not too much a fan of Bruce Willis, but what he did in this movie was just astonishing. Together with Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt he should have won several awards for it, because together with the amazing story, they made this movie work so incredibly well.  Even after several viewings, I'm still a huge fan of this movie. Except for this movie, I have only seen one other Terry Gilliam movie and that's \\\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\\", which wasn't bad, but didn't really convince me either. However, it's this movie that really makes me look forward to his other work. I give it a 9/10, maybe even a 9.5/10.\", \"Terry Gilliam's and David Peoples' teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the '90's. People's proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time \\u0097 I especially love the idea one can't change the past; it's a nice counterpoint to so many time-travelling movies which say otherwise \\u0097 biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness. Gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness, perfection and originality.  The story itself is engaging: one man, James Cole (played by Bruce Willis in a heart-warming performance) travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that's wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground: with the information he'll collect, scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface. But because their time-travelling technology isn't perfect, he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things. And from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists, end of the millennium paranoia, biological weapons, the perception of reality, and the definition of sanity. With such a complex movie, it was easy for Gilliam and Peoples to create a mess, but instead Twelve Monkeys is a thought-provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas.  I watched this movie once around 10 years ago. It marked me a lot: I remember still thinking about many days after-wards; for my young mind this seemed quite mind-blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important. I've re-watched this movie a few days ago on DVD and it's better than I remembered it. Brad Pitt still steals all the scenes he's in, playing Jeffrey Goines \\u0097 almost a prelude to his Tyler Durden character in Fight Club \\u0097 a rich kid with some anarchist/non-conformist ideas who's also crazy and, according to Cole, perhaps responsible for the virus. The scenes between Jeffrey and Cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie, Pitt's eyes, voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he's really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands. Pitt's Oscar nomination was well deserved! Surprising was also Bruce Willis' performance: his I didn't remember very well, but it's beautiful and full of sensibility; he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground, and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up. Cole is a rather ambiguous character, Peoples' tried to imbue some darkness in him, and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself: the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked. Ironically Cole didn't start as a crazy character, but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world, he's considered mad and convinced it's all in his mind, until he arrives at a point when he can't distinguish past from future, reality from fiction. Willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure, and it works perfectly. One of the fun twists in the narrative is when Cole's shrink, Dr. Kathryn Railly, finds undeniable proof he's really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world. The screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace. Their relationship is also well-handed, although perhaps a bit compressed for time's sake. But I enjoyed watching Cole and Railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past. But then things end in a tragic/bittersweet climax at an airport, wrapping all the pieces together, which will blow many minds away.  There are two great endings in this movie, a twist in the sense of Se7en or Fight Club, and a more intimate ending where Railly is crouching next to Cole who's just been shot and looking around for a younger James Cole who's witnessing his future self die; the two share a brief look, and she smiles at him. The twist is brilliant, but I prefer this ending for emotional impact. Madeleine Stowe is very good playing Dr. Railly, she drew many different emotions from me in her performance. The movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can't be changed: this movie shows that in a terrifying way. It reminds me of Chinatown in that sense, the way Jake Gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help. Railly's character shares that fatalism, the more she tries to help Cole \\u0097 first dealing with his 'madness' then helping him in his mission \\u0097 the more they're sucked into tragedy.  The twist ends with a hopeful note, though, with the feeling Cole's mission hasn't been in vain. Twelve Monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained; it's not supposed to be art, although it's more artists than many artistic movies. It's an unpretentious movie where all elements, from music to editing to costume design, etc., came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece.\", \"Without a doubt, 12 MONKEYS is one of the best films of the Sci-fi genre and director Terry Gilliam is no stranger at pulling off such cinematic originality. An apocalyptic film that holds you completely spellbound, 12 MONKEYS never lets up and has you guessing all the way throughout. Excellent use of Philadelphia locales and netherworld sets create a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in time at the wrong place.  Bruce Willis escapes his macho image and portrays a true loony who happens to be right about all that will happen. He is actually sane, but the people of the future (or present if you will) distort this guy's head so bad through time travel, no wonder he unravels. He gets sent to World War I just after beng sent to the wrong year to find out how the Army of the Twelve Monkeys pulls off the annihilation of civilization as we know it. They finally get it right and in what is truly a remarkable screenplay to match the performance, we get to see Willis, Madeleine Stowe and an ominous Brad Pitt cross-referenced over the course of 6 years.  Stowe is sensual and solid as the risk-taking shrink who slowly starts to realize that Willis may not be as cracked up as he seems. A captivating element of the relationship between her and Willis is their sense of \\\"seeing\\\" each other before, in another place or time. 12 MONKEYS is essentially about time and the madness the futuristic people immerse into it and the times of the present, when killers and a psychotic genius can alter the world.  The brooding city of Philadelphia is a dark and gothic backdrop for Willis' plight to complete his mission which is, against all usual Hollywood stereotype, NOT to save the world. He is gathering information. The film plays tricks on the viewer as well, placing Willis in a new setting at the drop of a pin. This must have been an extremely difficult picture to make but Gilliam seems to be the master of hard-boiled movie making. He even drops in some humor reminiscent of other great works like TIME BANDITS, and BRAZIL. The screen is this man's canvas and he knows how to paint a sometimes terrifying picture of the world and its possible future within the mainstream atmosphere of big-budget films. If you want sincere madness and ironic tragedy, see 12 MONKEYS.  RATING: 9 of 10\", \"A linear travel within a non-linear structure. It's a fact that time, in 12 monkeys, flows in this come-and-go between present, future and past. However, the movie's linearity can't be avoided: it's the very work of the projector, the unfolding of the narrative.  What we can see underlying the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions. The world of this Terry Gilliam film is a world with little space for free-will.  Right from the beginning we are informed about a schizophrenic's prophecy, according to which a plague would rule the Earth in 1997, forcing the few survivors to live underground - the only place not affected by the virus.  Cole's (Willis) mission is clear: return to the mid 90's to investigate whatever and whoever is related to the release of the virus. There's no way to change the past: all that can be done is gather information that can help the scientists of the present (that, for us viewers, is the future) find the cure. Not to change what happened (the past is inevitable), but make the present better.  In his \\\"returns\\\" in time, Cole gradually comes near a striking dilemma: his life in the past is better than his life in the present.  The latter is dark and dehumanizing, controlled by totalitarian scientists that elect \\\"volunteers\\\" (this word is incisively ironic) to embark on the journeys to the past.  The scientists have not yet reached the highest level of achievements in time travel, and Cole ends up on wrong dates - this will, later in the plot, work as a proof of his sanity for the psychiatrist Kathryn (Stowe).  We can see, through the evolution of the story, that linearity and non-linearity interlace in a circular temporality.  There is more than one moment in which the scene that is the first and ends up being almost the last - and certainly the climactic - appears. It modifies itself, according to the evocation of Cole's memories, that come up in his dreams.  In an airport, a man is shot dead while running, armed, toward someone else. A blonde woman runs after the murdered one.  This is the scene that connects the past (in which Cole is a kid that visits the airport with his parents), the present (the time of the narrative) and the future (adult Cole) Throughout the narrative, Cole has the feeling of having already lived the reality he is experiencing now. His prophetic dreams are the proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened. The agents that shoot him stop him from killing the mad scientist, doctor Peters (Morse), that is the responsible for the dissemination of the disease.  What was can't be changed. And, in Cole's case, what was is what will be. Eternally.  A film not quite well understood for many. To me, nothing less than a masterpiece.  Other good movies with similar theme: The Back to the future trilogy (that has another angle regarding the \\\"mad scientist\\\" character, and although it shares the atmosphere of decay - particularly in the second film -, it is way more optimistic than Gilliam's work, that is an odd Hollywood picture).  In another register, there is \\\"Wild strawberries\\\", one of Bergman's masterpieces, that involves a striking and enlightening travel to the past through dreams and reminiscences.  I've never watched \\\"La Jet\\u00e9e\\\", but only because I can't find it.\", \"The big problem is where to begin as this movie needs your attention the forthcoming two hours and you better not miss some minutes for getting a coke as there is a danger you can't follow. But good there is also a pause-button. Bruce Willis must travel into a timemachine to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animals rule over the world in 1996. Thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in 1990, then in the First World War and how messed up it all might look like, Terry Gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever. This ex-Monty Phyton man knows exactly how genius SF-stories has to be told like and his choice of cast couldn't have been any better, there is the lunatic Brad Pitt (his performance in the asylum is memorable) and a superb Bruce Willis who proves he is more than some Schwarzenegger-wanna be. It's a movie you can watch over and over again as the script is so weird and complicated (and yet you can follow) that every view gives you other surprises. One of my big favourites.\", \"There is a story (possibly apocryphal) about an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the start of Twelve Monkeys. Gilliam (allegedly) produced a long list (think about the aircraft one from the Fifth Element) and handed it to Butch Bruce. It was entitled \\\"Things Bruce Willis Does When He Acts\\\". It ended with a simple message saying: \\\"please don't do any of the above in my movie\\\".  There is a fact about this movie (definitely true). Gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing.  I would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success that is The Twelve Monkeys.  Visually, the Twelve Monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a Gilliam film. It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness. Gilliam delights in wrong-footing his audience. Although the ending of the Twelve Monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real, Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka in the clockwork, bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate. It is this journey, and the character developments they undergo, which unsettles.  I love Gilliam films (Brazil, in particular). But they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas, and so much enthusiasm, that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess (Brazil, in particular). I still maintain that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force, but there's no denying that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tight-plotting department. Style, substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the ex-Python.  Whatever the truth of the rumour above, Gilliam also manages to get a first rate (and very atypical) performance out of the bald one. Bruce is excellent in this film, as are all the cast, particularly a suitably bonkers - and very scary - Brad Pitt.  It's been over a decade since this film was released. When I watched it again, I realised that it hadn't really aged. I had changed, of course. And this made me look at the film with fresh eyes. This seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that, partly at least, is about reflections in mirrors, altered perspectives and the absurd one-way journey through time that we all make. A first rate film. 8/10.\", \"With 'Twelve Monkeys' you need to pay attention, but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate. I know I did. The story is interesting and deals with time traveling. A virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who doesn't believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re-appears in 1996 Kathryn starts believing Cole's stories.  The movie constantly plays with time. Cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, it is picked up in the future and \\\"they\\\" send someone. For Cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call. Things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention. You could ask some questions but since you can't have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie.  'Twelve Monkeys' works as sci-fi, with some great images and a dark atmosphere, and it works as a thriller. You are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie. May be it has some flaws in the story, but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling, you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy. That was the easy part for me.\", \"Stories about the possibility of a post-apocalyptic future have been around for ages, since the very creation of science-fiction as a genre per se. The fact that today's society is responsible for what may become of the future in the near tomorrow, and that our own abuses and refusals to see what is right before out eyes are at the very center of all of these stories, whether they are good or bad.  Terry Gilliam of course is a natural for this kind of film. He gives the movie a decadent feel throughout, showing a society run ragged by its own excesses and bringing forth the a sense of imminent tragedy despite having moments of comedy. His world, the world in which TWELVE MONKEYS transpires, is a place where the mad run wild, where cities are collapsing in filth and neglect, where everything reeks of foreboding despite the luminosity of the opening sequence, where madness looms at every corner. This is a very dark movie, but his very best, most linear (despite the plot twists which hold up under examination), and one which gets better with repeated viewings.  A tragic event in which a deadly virus was unleashed onto humanity in 1996 and thus led to the extermination of Life On The Planet As We Have Known It leads to scientists of the future to try and make amends to change humanity's fate on the Earth by employing renegade citizens -- the scum of the Earth -- as guinea pigs to go back in time, among them one James Cole (underplayed to great effect by Bruce Willis). Cole could be any person. We don't know anything about him, but in a way, that doesn't matter since he is little more than one of many expendable volunteers and hints of his character sneak in later as he gets closer to fulfilling his mission. What we do know is that he is a man who dreams, and his dreams may have been reality: he may have already been at the scene of the Event of 1996.  It's this constant sense of deja vu that keeps popping up throughout the movie. When taken to a mental ward by mistake in 1990 he meets Jeffrey Goines (spastically played by Brad Pitt, Oscar-nominated here) who frantically spews forth talk about doom and destruction, and later Cole believes he has seen Goines in his recurring dream as a man pushing a boy aside while escaping... what? He doesn't know. Later he meets a psychologist, Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), and one of her first reactions to him is that he's insane, and that she's seen him before. This becomes a running notion throughout her participation in this story from passive/resistant to active and even slightly crazy believer that Something Terrible is coming This Way, especially when she meets him six years later: she has seen Cole before. At the same time, Cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the aisle, screaming for help, after shots have rung out and a particular red-headed man in a ponytail (Jeffrey Goines?) has apparently escaped, not before pushing the little boy who is an innocent bystander. The questions arise: have these events happened? Are they going to happen? Who is really a part of this, or better yet -- is everyone, down to the smallest player, a part of a Greater Plot? Or is this all some trick in the fabric of time in which Time in itself is one huge conveyor belt showing repetitions of fragments of events that slide by over and over again?   These questions are formulated in a masterful sequence which includes key scenes of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece VERTIGO in which Madeleine Elster/Judy Barton mourns her own brief existence (\\\"You took no notice,\\\" she says, as Cole and Railly watch from their seats in the movie theatre they are hiding in). Snippets of dialog from VERTIGO form a foil to the dialog between Railly and Cole and later, when Cole awakens from having apparently dozed off in the theatre and goes looking for Railly, he comes face-to-face with her in disguise (looking almost exactly like Eva Maria Saint from NORTH BY NORTHWEST) as the swelling Bernard Herrmann score plays the emergence of Judy Barton, dressed as Madeleine Elster. It's a fascinating sequence, more so because of the most improbable occurrence of the names of the actors in both films: Madeleine Stowe plays Kathryn Railly who dons a blond wig and grey trench-coat and calls herself \\\"Judy Simmons\\\" while helping an \\\"insane\\\" man named James Cole; James Stewart plays a detective who tries to help \\\"insane\\\" Madeleine Elster who will later re-appear not once, but twice, first as brunette Judy Barton, and later, as Madeleine. Action and re-enaction, play and re-play.\", \"Terry Gilliam's stunning feature-length adaptation of Chris Marker's short film LA JETEE is full of mind-bending surprises, yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast. Gilliam's flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by David and Janet Peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor James Cole (Willis at his most Steve McQueen-like -- better than McQueen, even!), a time-traveling convict from the future who literally doesn't know whether he's coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals. Willis, the justifiably Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers. Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is haunting. This one's a don't-miss!\", \"I had the privilege of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago, and outside the theater I was confronted by a camera crew from a local TV station looking for comments on the film. At the time, the only words that escaped my mouth were \\\"Awesome. Just awesome.\\\" I like to think I can articulate myself a little better than that, but at the time I was somewhat incapable of doing so.  The story is intriguing and thought provoking, and the acting is first rate from all the principals. This film was the first one that Terry Gilliam directed that he didn't have a hand in the writing credit for. Back with Universal after his long, arduous battle with them over \\\"Brazil\\\", Terry had achieved what he wanted most; the \\\"final cut\\\". Terry is a master craftsman, and each shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been constructed carefully with determination and conviction. It is only justice that such an individual should be unfettered in his attempts to convey a concept. Unfortunately, limitations still exist in such arrangements.  The Universal Collector's Edition DVD of this film is simply amazing, although most of the bonus features aren't listed on the box. It contains among other things, a director/producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90 minute documentary on the making of the film called \\\"The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys\\\". It tells of some of the creative pitfalls in filmmaking, including a test of mettle when preview screenings tested poorly, striking the team with feelings of self-doubt and despair. Fortunately, for all of us, they decided to change very little about the film and released it to an enormous success.   \", \"Just kidding, I rented 12 Monkeys the other day because I am a huge Bruce Willis fan and I heard some things about the film. Some good and some bad, but it was one of those films you had to pay attention to every second, so I was a bit worried. Just because I felt like for a minute if this was going to be one of those films that I had to watch several times to get. But I watched it last night and I was really impressed, this movie had everything in it: action, drama, sci-fi, history, dark humor, and even a little romance. The actors all did a terrific job, I give a lot of credit to Bruce, during his scene in the car with his psychiatrist, he really got to me. But Brad Pitt, I'm just amazed with how much of a great job he did. He didn't over do his character, who was crazy, and just made it work and was extremely believable. The story was just scary, but very good and a wake up call.  James Cole is a man in the future where a virus broke out in the past and killed 5 billion people and only 1% of the population survived including him. Animals are now ruling the ground above while the humans are down below, but scientists send James to the past of 1990(really meaning to send him to '96), to find out about information of the virus. James gets put into a mental institution meeting his new psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Raily and another mental patient, Jeffrey Goines. He tells them the future, of course no one believes him, he goes back to the future. But the scientists send him back to the correct year to where the doctor is kidnapped by James, but he tells her more, and believes him. Now they are set on trying to prevent the virus from ever happening.  12 Monkeys was an incredible film. Like I said the story was so scary just because it's not at all hard to believe that we are not far from that happening. But the whole movie was just great, the cast, the sets, just the whole picture was a great one. It had a Terminator type of feel to it where we might loose something precious one day, ourselves if we don't listen to others. What is right and what is wrong? Who knows? But I would highly recommend 12 Monkeys, it's a great movie that if you give it the proper chance, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  9/10\", \"\\\"Twelve monkeys\\\"'s got all the elements to become Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. An outstanding screenplay, a sustained rhythm, clever sometimes ironic dialogs. Moreover, he had a good nose about the cast. \\\"Twelve monkeys\\\" is also the first movie where Bruce Willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies. Here, a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero (as it was the case in \\\"Die hard\\\"). No matter how he tries, he's a prisoner of the time. The movie contains a very thrilling end too. It's got a real dramatic power. But this terrific movie is also a reflection about man, the dangers he dreads (notably, the ones that could cause the end of the world and here, these are virus that can create illnesses). No matter how long it will take, \\\"twelve monkeys\\\" will be estimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.\", \"Terry Gilliam's fantastic, twisted story of a virus destroying all but a handful of people across the Earth and forcing them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather information about it is a fantastic, dizzying, and highly stylized film that boasts Bruce Willis' best performance ever.  What sets 12 Monkeys apart from most time-travel sci-fi movies is that Bruce Willis character actually deals with what the psychological effects of time-travel, that is, not knowing what reality is actual reality: the place that the time-traveler comes from or goes to. Also, the film recognizes that things that have past cannot be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event, in this case the release of said virus, cannot be stopped or changed. As Willis asserts \\\"It's already happened,\\\" while he's in a mental hospital, the major dilemma the film trudges into is not a trite, overdone plot to save the world; instead it's Willis' inner struggle to simply survive himself. It's a fresh, innovative concept, and it works beautifully thanks to a tautly written script by Peoples and Gilliam's unique brand of dementia.  Besides this, 12 Monkey's storytelling is totally non-linear and instead opts to distort and bend the way the story is told skillfully incorporating a bevy of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past, the future, and even a scene that is lifted out of Hitchcock's Vertigo. All serve to envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony of madness and futility.  Visually, Gilliam is a master of desolate umbrage and shadow rivalling Tim Burton in his strikingly despondent scenery and imagery. With cold, wide, and immersing cinematography, Gilliam plunges into the colorless surroundings and darkness of his characters. The scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic, dead white and help serve as a contrast to the often veering-on-madness characters.  Performance-wise, Brad Pitt steals most scenes, filling them with a patented loony, off-the-wall performance that deservedly garnered him an Oscar nomination. As mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career, not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and instead portraying Cole as a simple, poignant, tragic everyman. Equally good is Madeline Stowe as Willis' psychologist. She holds her own, injecting her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to believe is a false 'religion.'  Gilliam's expert, overwhelming, and complex handling of what could have been a routine action/sci-fi film makes 12 Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape. Its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding, bleak cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness. Ranking in my top 10 of all time, 12 Monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle of a film brimming with brilliance.  10 out of 10\"], \"review_score\": [9, 9, 9, 10, 7, 10, 10, 10, 9, 9, 10, 8, 8, 10, 10, 9, 10, 9, 10, 9, 10, 9, 8, 10, 10, 9, 10, 9, 9, 10], \"review_category\": [\"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\", \"pos_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 9.3}, \"U-Turn\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0102224\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"U Turn\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0120399\", \"total_review_count\": 7, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"On the first viewing, this struck me as an overwrought film noir with the tragic overtones slathered on heavily.

Now every time the horns of \\\"Ring of Fire\\\" announce Powers Boothe striding in to the rescue, I'm ready to bust a gut. The supporting players become either Sean Penn's comic foils or high-strung straight men. Speaking of which, this movie really marked Jon Voight's transition from washed-up blonde leading man to a truly quirky and interesting character actor. My only complaint is that a theme from Ennio Morricone's score kept running through my head before I could remember this is the movie where I heard it.\", \"In many ways this is one of the finest casts assembled in the last 5 years. Unfortunately the film always has the 'straight to video' feel. Penn and Thornton are excellent, whilst Nolte (majorly hamming it up) and Lopez are poor. The black comedy/noir works for a while. Ultimately it's source was a novel with potential, that collapsed into a messy conclusion. The film sticks to the source for once. Stone does seem to be losing it big time. The visual tricks and images are becoming increasingly irritating. For films that cover similar topics/themes, check out the superior 'Red Rock West' and 'The Music Of Chance'.\", \"A sad and pathetic overture in the life and times of Oliver Stone. Sadly, after making so many great films to this point, Stone was forced to rebuild his career after creating this crummy film. Having enjoyed Sean Penn's movies in the past, this seemed a real departure for him. There is very little to say about this film, except it help Stone wise up and create Any Given Sunday.\", \"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Sean Penn is stranded in a strange city where everybody seems to realize his problems and his struggle, and insist on being particularly mean to him, just for the sake of being mean.  It is a lot like Chevy Chase in National Lampoon's Vacation or Griffin Dunne in After Hours, in the sense that we watch an incredibly hapless main character go through an incredibly terrible day and we're supposed to call that entertainment. Except that instead of a comedy this one is a mean and boring excuse for a thriller where everybody is weird and bad-ass, so the whole thing reeks of Tarantino or any of those awful El Mariachi sequels.  There are indeed several twists in the plot, but all of them are predictable and absolutely unable to make the film a little interesting. The end doesn't even try to make up for the rest of the experience. It's just as dull and silly.  The only good thing I can say about this film is that the cast is very good. There are lots of good acting, but the story and the overall atmosphere is so brain dead that I couldn't really enjoy the acting.  I always found that Oliver Stone's movies were excessively long-winded and pretentious. Now I read here at IMDb that he \\\"wanted to make a small film that he would enjoy seeing as a teenager\\\". So he is definitely a major idiot, and I will never see any of his movies again.  I give it 3 stars, for the acting. Maybe the actors deserved more for the acting, but they also deserve a penalty for signing up such a bad script.\", \"Unsympathetic characters, dragged-out ending, predictable...If you got to watch it, watch it for the supporting characters(Voight,Danes,Phoenix, and especially, Billy Bob Thorton). Other than that, avoid at all costs!\", \"The cast of this film is amazing, along with a great director, so how did this film turn out to be so unwatchable? None of the blame lies on the actors, although you do wonder why they would sign up for something with such a bad screenplay!   Loathsome characters, dire setting, badly edited and way too drawn out. The soundtrack doesn't help much either, creating a horrible atmosphere. I believe this is Oliver Stones attempt at a Quentin Tarantino move, but fails on so many levels. It's actually depressing to think about, knowing that I wasted two hours of my life watching it. I would love to meet Oliver Stone and beat him over the head with the DVD I wasted \\u00a33.99 on.\", \"This movie was a major disappointment, but with a fantastic cast. I didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie, but I wanted to throw it out the window when I came across the first scene of the dead animals. It was Unnecessary to see Bobby (Sean Penn) running over an animal. Was that needed? Grace (Jennifer Lopez) got on my nerves, didn't like her at all, the performance from Jennifer Lopez weren't all that great either. This movie all in all, was boring. What was good about it? Only one thing, Toby (Joaquin Phoenix) and Jenny (Claire Danes). The only form of entertainment of this Movie. Joaquin surprised me with his small, but outstanding performance.

Unforgiven, though simple in plot it falls flat on characters and emotions and i would certainly say that Unforgiven is Eastwoods worst film to date. Eastwoods himself seems too old to play the part of acting and directing which also adds a downfall to the overall look of the film.  All the characters seem rushed and ragged around the edges especially Eastwoods character. The acting doesn't seem to flow and contribute to what the characters are feeling. The direction is poorly misled by quirky shots. So overall Unforgiven is not Eastwoods best and by far one of the worst westerns around.\", \"And now for another point of view: I didn't like it. I didn't finish it in fact. I know that \\\"Unforgiven\\\" is ranked by some as one of the greatest Westerns ever made. I know that it stars and was directed by Clint Eastwood, one of the icons of American cinema. I know that it won a bunch of Oscars. Still, I didn't like it. I don't like Westerns, and that's clearly a matter of taste, but I also don't admire Eastwood's acting. He is not and never has been a leading man. He is no Burt Lancaster, no Paul Newman, no John Wayne. In this film alone he is dwarfed by Richard Harris and Gene Hackman; they are both actors. No, Eastwood is a tall guy with a reedy voice who usually plays tough guys. Here he plays a retired tough guy. When I see him on screen, I see a man laboring at his acting. Then there's the anti-Western Western plot. It is too obviously intended to inject contemporary values -- a respect for the role of women, blacks, native Americans, and single parents; a disrespect for violence and drinking; the wholesomeness that comes with marriage, including interracial marriage, and small adorable children -- into a century in which those values weren't necessarily accepted, at least in these ways. By promoting those values, the movie comes across as mannered, if not preachy. Then there are the hoary movie stereotypes -- prostitutes with hearts of gold, the kid who can't shoot straight, the city slicker new to the wild West, the sage brush shimmering on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in major chords. Finally there is the pacing of Eastwood's direction. I gave up after an hour. Eastwood was still riding north, chatting with Morgan Freeman and the kid who couldn't shoot straight, sixty minutes after the plot driven by the slashing of a prostitute was set in motion. It was way too slow. Somebody had to find these elements uncompelling.

The scenes have one character missing and the teens are able to enter the waxworks. For each waxwork, there is a sequence based on the lead-up to whatever the waxwork represented. At the end of each sequence, the waxwork is completed (using a nice edit that is the only thing I can applaud in this movie). With that premise, the film could have been A LOT better  Unfortunately, one of the waxworks is, as I mentioned, based on \\\"Return of the living Dead\\\" or some other zombie movie, and there is only one thing you can do when faced with a horde of zombies.

This is the basic storyline but they add a \\\"rule the world\\\" theme concocted by the leader of the museum. He believes that once each exhibit has had it's chance to kill they will all come to life and conquer all !! Mu ha ha!! The movie has a campiness that makes you think initially it will be a comedy but it really just turns into a slow moving horror movie. The exhibits include the werewolf, a vampire, the Marquis de sade and an alien that isn't really explored. This is where the movie tries to pay tribute to these type of movies but fails. At least the movie didn't turn out to be a kill all teens slasher movie and they tried a different style in the storytelling to put away the worthless teenagers but it still doesn't really work as an interesting movie.\", \"this is one bizarre movie.it's sick and twisted and perverse.and it has to be dun tongue in cheek.there's just no way this was s opposed to be a serious movie.i guess you could call it a black comedy/horror-if you really wanted to.most of the movie is atrocious,including the very hammy overacting,the even worse dialogue and the even worse than that script.yet it is oddly(very oddly,)entertaining at points,and very boring at others.it's between 95 and 97 minutes,depending on whether you watch the rated or unrated edition,not including credits.the one positive thing about this movie is that the makeup effects weren't half bad.still,i'm glad it ended when it did.i don't think i could've taken anymore inane dialogue.the most i ca give this thing is a 4/10,for it's entertaining moments.\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"What Lies Beneath\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0161081\", \"total_review_count\": 5, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"Because this movie is a waste of talent and time. If you have seen the movie trailer, you've seen most of the movie. Granted,I usually like Harrison Ford, and this was a good role for him. However, Robert Zemeckis seems to be obsessed with rich and affluent white people than about the horror story that this movie is suppossed to be about. I think everything in the movie came out of L.L. Bean. Anyways, I'm digressing...the movie is just plain bad...sure there is suspense in this movie, but it's minute. How many times are we suppossed to believe that Michelle Pfiefer is going to go into that bathroom? And another thing, I'm all about adapting or taking some part of a previous movie and use it as an homage to great directors or movies, but I am tired of Zemeckis ripping off other movies and directors. Watch Diabolique or any good Hitchcock film and save yourself 2 hours of this immeasurable bore of a movie.  \", \"Probably one of the most predictable and boring movies of this year. The plot is so stupid that it is insulting to the viewer. It takes about 25 minutes of the movie to figure out how it is going to end. The ghost part of it contributes even more to the feeling that you really wasted your money this time. To find this movie scary you would have to be very young or have very little movie experience. The movie contains about 50 scenes where you know that in 2 seconds time, there will be a BOOOO effect and when it comes you do not get scared rather angry that you actually paid money to watch this rubbish.  How Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford ever agreed to take part in this misery is a riddle to me, but I guess they were both paid good. Michelle Pfeiffer is to me one of the most beautiful women of the world - she almost gets better looking as she is getting older and her acting is very fine in this film, but it just is not enough. Avoid.\", \"Although the movie has the same theme as the Sixth Sense, its ending is rather chaotic and unbelievable. The movie should have ended in the bathroom ... but the subsequent scenes were just added to increase the tension with opposite effect. In these horrible scenes the sound volume was increased to unbearable heights (annoying), and the movie glitched from moderate level down to disaster level.  You can skip this one !\", \"Sorry, but Zemeckis is no Hitchcock.  This movie paid great homage to other films (see others' reviews) and had several unsettling and subtly horrific shots, but was otherwise pretty bland fare. I recommend waiting till it comes out on video so you can fast forward past the many uninteresting and unnecessary filler scenes. By the time the tension actually increases, you may find yourself waaaay past caring.  ***SPOILERS***  Michelle Pfeiffer gave a good and varied performance (much better than in 'Wolf'), in contrast to Harrison Ford's humdrum husband. Which is interesting, since 'Norman' was supposed to be a 'brilliant' scientist. He did nothing in the film to even be considered 'bright', IMO. He seemed very tranquilized (yawn) until the \\\"hahahahaha, I'm a killer and you're next\\\" bit. I'll take Anthony Perkins or even Vince Vaughn's 'Norman' any day of the week compared to this passive loser.  The film wasn't awful, but several things made me chuckle out of sheer disbelief. The first time Claire sees the ghost in the bathtub, before Norman runs in after her scream, it takes what, 5 seconds for the whole tub to drain! Then, later, it takes forever for the water to drain past her nose when her magic toes pull up the plug. And what faucet do you know that will cut 80% of the water supply after only a quarter turn? It wouldn't have been as laughable if the ghost had been involved, but this was not even hinted at . . . and the cliche's continued . . .  This movie took forever to advance the plot, and the silly, obvious red herring involving the next-door neighbors was pretty irritating.  The slow pace of the film felt like the dredging of a lake bottom. Too bad the film's body didn't surface a little sooner.\", \"I'm getting really tired of movies that portray a Ghost as a modern-day \\\"The Riddler\\\" from the Batman TV series! Like The Riddler, the Ghost in \\\"What Lies Beneath\\\" has all the answers that you're looking for -- but you're only going to get pieces to the puzzle one incoherent piece at a time.  Let's all get on the same page here for a minute. We know, having watched the movie in full, that the ghost has these powers/abilities: 1) Can TYPE ON A COMPUTER KEYBOARD (or, at the very least, get words to appear on a computer screen)!! 2) Can write easy-to-read English on a fogged-up mirror, as if you were using your finger. 3) Can appear to numerous people (as the ghost appeared, in one way or another, to both the main stars in the movie). 4) Can open closed doors. 5) I'm not entirely sure about this one, but it seemed as if the ghost \\\"took over\\\" Claire's body and/or mind at one point (and mysteriously began acting sexually towards her murderer of all people, Mr. Ford).  Why would a ghost, with the abilities outlined above, give you vague clues in pieces and not simply tell you what the hell is going on?! As a Ghost, if you can get words to appear on a computer screen, WHY IN THE HELL wouldn't you just write \\\"Your husband is a murderer, you can find my body at the end of your dock, my name is...\\\". Why would you simply type your initials hundreds of times over and over?! Again, are we dealing with The Riddler here?! If that wouldn't work, how about just writing to Claire on the mirror after every shower each day?? If you were a Ghost, and all you COULD DO is leave messy clues to somebody you hope will help solve your murder, would you, upon getting screamed at from the top of your helper's lungs \\\"What do you want?!?!\\\" -- really write back a simple \\\"You Know!\\\"???? Obviously she didn't know yet, she was still gathering clues and thought she was going insane!! Wouldn't you have used that moment to write something just a bit more profound?! Like, maybe, \\\"I need your help!\\\". Wow.  And at one point the Ghost \\\"took over\\\" Claire's body and/or mind -- don't even get me started on how she could have easily killed her murderer -- so shouldn't she have tried killing Harrison Ford's character, her murderer, instead of just getting him horny?! I could go on and on, but at this point, I'm fatigued over this plot-hole-filled tripe. I just want to emphasize -- I hate when Ghosts are portrayed as The Riddler's character in the Batman series - as simple clue-givers.  :)   JD\"], \"review_score\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \"review_category\": [\"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\", \"unsup_train\"], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"What Women Want\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0207201\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"The Witching Hour\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0181904\", \"total_review_count\": 0, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [], \"review_score\": [], \"review_category\": [], \"average_review_score\": 0}, \"White Angel\": {\"IMDB_ID\": \"tt0108558\", \"total_review_count\": 1, \"total_rating_count\": 0, \"review_content\": [\"I saw this film years ago - so am a bit rusty - but since I'm reading their book at the moment I feel compelled to write: The thing that I remember most about it is this: The main characters are two despicable types so you don't care for them - I found my self not caring what happened because there was nothing about the characters to like or admire or empathise with.

They should have got feedback/reviews and done subsequent drafts and sorted that problem out first IMHO before shooting. It's was no surprise then to me that Mirimax and others wouldn't distribute it, and the offers they got were so small.

WHO'S YOUR DADDY? stars Brandon Davis as an adopted high school senior Chris Hughes, a geek who inherits the heir to a porn empire left to him by his biological parents. Though the premise sounds like the movie could be a lot of fun, it is ruined by inept directing from first-time director Andy Fickman, a clich\\u00e9d and predictable screenplay, and acting that is even bad by direct-to-video standards. Even the normally funny Charlie Talbert turns in a surprisingly dismal performance as the best friend. Ali Landry is the only good part of this lame and unfunny dud. 1/10\", \"When a comedy movie boasts its marvelous soundtrack on the back cover you know your not dealing with a top notch movie. I rented this movie with friends expecting to get some chuckles but overall to get most of our laughs off each other making fun of the movie. We couldn't have chosen a worse movie.  The movie may have been alright with a few changes. First off, the comedy was painful. Physical gags were poorly performed and placed. The fat kid in the movie made us want to kill ourselves, bless him for trying scene in and scene out but he was like a puppy begging for love. If he had been pulled from the movie everything might have been bearable. There were some funny jokes, I believe one was when the group of boys steal one of the parent's porn movies and it turns out to be gay porn. But to best sum up the comedy I will simply tell the opening gag for the fat kid. He wears a puke stained shirt and talks about not knowing when something is done.  To finish off, the editor of the movie could have saved the movie by removing the fat kid, cutting out 20 minutes of the school scenes and making an ending that is longer than thirty seconds of random bickering.  OH, BTW, there are two good elements that the movie possesses. Kadeem Hardison plays his role wonderfully and performs his jokes so that none are missed or under-appreciated. The other redeeming element to the movie is the beautiful Mrs. Ali Landry. Her character is ignored most of the movie which is a shame.  Don't waste your time even renting this one. It didn't appeal to me and I was part of the target audience (18 male).\", \"My friends usually can put up with a lot of hopeless movies but this one was too poor for us to even watch it to the end. It was just so boring and unoriginal. Not even the \\\"hot\\\" girls that starred in this movie could keep me watching. Everything was just predicable and annoying.  The acting was at times good.....but more times bad. The most annoying character in the whole movie that you just wanted to die would have to be the main characters best friend. The more i saw him the more i wanted to smash my screen. (you know what fat ugly kid I'm talking about)  The plot has been done so many times before i think they should be sued by other movie companies. OK, it is a good idea but thats all this movie had.  Overall this movie can only be watched if by your self, to save any abuse from your friends. Or, if you have absolutely nothing better to do.\", \"Chris, an adopted son of a moral family, a loser whom works at the school newspaper with Kate (Christine Lakin from of the awful sugary \\\"Step by Step\\\" show of the now thankfully defunct ABC's TGIF line-up), finds out that he's just inherited a porn empire from his biological parents. He loses sight of what true friendship and love is and blah blah some other nonsense. He also has to contend with an Uncle who wants control of the family business and a shifty lawyer (arn't they are?) A slightly below average teen comedy that steals from better teen comedies (the opening alone is HIGHLY American Pie-esquire), bops you on the head with the moral every chance it gets, and wastes the only star talent it has (Wayne Newton, Lin Shaye, and if i'm really stretching the star word, Martin Starr of \\\"Freaks and Geeks\\\", and Justin Berfield of \\\"Malcolm in the Middle\\\").
