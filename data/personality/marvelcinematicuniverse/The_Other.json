{"id": "The_Other", "name": "The Other", "fandom": "marvelcinematicuniverse", "url": "https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Other", "personality": ["The Other was extremely loyal to Thanos, as well as a powerful and intimidating individual. Additionally, he used his hideous looks and comparison of Thanos' mighty power to something god-like in order to cause Thanos' other allies and servants such as Loki and Ronan the Accuser to respect him, to varying degrees of success. The Other would do anything he possibly could to serve and please Thanos, to the point of becoming intensely angry with anyone who perceivably disrespected his master. The Other was sharp-tongued and pompous and had a tendency to emulate the behaviour of his interlocutors. For instance, in the presence of Loki who showed mocking contempt for him, the Other attempted to bite back his fury and match Loki's cool disdain. The hot-headed Ronan by contrast largely ignored the Other's presence and angrily ranted at Thanos himself, causing the Other to become increasingly angry and blustery until he finally lost his temper and screamed in fury at Ronan, resulting in his own immediate demise.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
