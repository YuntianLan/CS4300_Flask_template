{"id": "Hodor", "name": "Hodor", "fandom": "gameofthrones", "url": "https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Hodor", "personality": ["Hodor generally seems to have a happy demeanor, overjoyed by basic things like presenting Bran with a new saddle, hearing the echo of his own voice in a well, or greeting one of the Stark direwolves. He is deeply loyal to the Starks, who have treated him very well, apart from the time Bran Stark unintentionally warged into him as a child to save himself, causing Hodor to become simple-minded. Despite his large size and strength, Hodor is a gentle soul who is terrified by violence - even violence done by himself, as he often cowers in fear instead of fighting back against foes who are actually smaller than he is (something Rast chastises him for). When he kills Locke, he expresses total horror at what he had done, even though he had been under Bran's influence at the time. Even so, his loyalty to the Starks is so great that he continues to follow (or rather, carry) Bran Stark through great dangers.\n", "In his youth, before his fateful seizure, Wylis had a friendly personality, capable of normal speech. In spite of their class differences, he got on well with Lyanna, Ned, and Benjen Stark. He was also somewhat interested in learning how to fight, and paid enough attention to the Stark children's training that he was able to articulate their strengths and weaknesses in combat. Wylis was polite, referring to Lyanna as 'm'lady' despite their clear friendship.\n"], "personality_quotes": [], "figure_captions": [], "quote": ["Hodor.", "â€•Hodor", "A Man Without Honor"], "description": "Hodor, originally named Wylis,[1] was a simpleminded servant of House Stark at Winterfell working in the stables.\n"}
