This demonstrated a sense of naivety as Voldemort would have likely known he was lying either through Legilimency or simply because the lie was somewhat unbelievable. He did show genuine concern for his sister when he found her unconscious, suggesting that he did care about her at least. He was also incredibly arrogant as he demanded that McGonagall would support him.[5]\n", "Moreover, Amycus did not seem to be very bright, as he was unable to answer the riddle to get into Ravenclaw Tower when asked by the eagle knocker on the door, or to give a reason why Harry Potter would go into Ravenclaw Tower when he was of Gryffindor House, when asked by Minerva McGonagall. He also didn't seem very suspicious about Severus Snape's true loyalties, suggesting that he truly believed that Snape was on their side.\n"], "personality_quotes": [["Eagle door knocker: \"Where do Vanished objects go?\"\n", "Amycus Carrow: \"I dunno, do I?
