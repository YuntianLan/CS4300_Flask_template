{"id": "Mundungus_Fletcher", "name": "Mundungus Fletcher", "fandom": "harrypotter", "url": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Mundungus_Fletcher", "personality": ["Mundungus was a petty and unscrupulous criminal, specialising in committing petty crimes to make as much profit as he could. He always took valuable things from wherever he went, such as 12 Grimmauld Place. After Sirius Black's death, Mundungus stole his possessions, including Salazar Slytherin's Locket. He was also somewhat cowardly, as he abandoned Alastor Moody during the Battle of the Seven Potters; Moody was killed by Lord Voldemort immediately afterwards. It is possible that Mundungus fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, because, if he did, he most likely survived the war and continued his work as an disreputable artefact dealer.\n", "However, Mundungus appeared to be braver than people such as Peter Pettigrew. Though he had a tendency to flee when the situation seemed grim, he never actually turned against the Order of the Phoenix. Also, his crimes mainly included stealing and robbing, never harming or killing others, meaning he was capable of compassion and decency. He was capable of loyalty and repaying debts, if only to Dumbledore.\n"], "personality_quotes": [["Mundungus: \"Sirius? This solid silver, mate?\"\n", "Sirius Black: \"Yes.
