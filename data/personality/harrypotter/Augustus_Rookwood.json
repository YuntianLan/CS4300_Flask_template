He also appeared being outgoing and perhaps affable, being a friend of Ludovic Bagman's father. This is further supported by everyone's surprise when Igor Karkaroff named him as a Death Eater. He was also shown to be rather fearful of Lord Voldemort when delivering bad news to him. However, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Rookwood showed ruthlessness in combat, as he did not hesitate to attack students who remained in the battlefield.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
