He became an executioner primarily out of his fondness for killing. This was an interest shared by Golgomath (the Gurg of the Giants) that Macnair parleyed with on Voldemort's behalf. He expressed his disappointment at being denied the opportunity to execute Buckbeak the Hippogriff, by swinging his axe into a wooden post before his departure. He also appeared  to be rather brutal in his methods such as when he violently grabbed Harry Potter by the throat when attempting to get the prophecy. Despite his viciousness he doesn't seem to be one of the more loyal Death Eaters as he did not search for his master following his original defeat.\n"], "personality_quotes": [["\"Maniac, he is.

Macnair did not search for Voldemort after his first downfall, but this was forgiven after Voldemort's return. He managed to avoid Azkaban, and worked for the Ministry of Magic as Executioner. \n"}
