She was also kind and gentle. Harry Potter once noted, that off the Quidditch pitch she wouldn't hurt a fly. Furthermore, she disliked those who had a pure-blood obsession. Katie believed that there were no differences between pure-bloods and Muggle-borns, as she became particularly angry when Malfoy called Hermione Granger a \"Mudblood\", showing her to be very tolerant of individuals of different blood statuses.  \n", "Katie was also brave and determined, since she was sorted into Gryffindor house and was a member of Dumbledore's Army, in order to oppose Dolores Umbridge. She also courageously fought alongside fellow D.A. members during the Battle of Hogwarts, opposing various Death Eaters and even ended up surviving the battle, showing her immense loyalty and dedication to defending her school.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
