Indeed, she never asked questions about how her patients received their ailments or questioning the sometimes ludicrous stories they told her, but instead immediately set to fixing them up.[15]\n", " She had a tendency to burst into tears at moments where great sorrow was appropriate, but she was capable of controlling herself if need be. She also has her standards and loyalty, as she would have resigned in protest when Minerva McGonagall was shot down by four Stunning Spells from a cowardly Ministry attack, were she not worried for the students.\n"], "personality_quotes": [], "figure_captions": [], "quote": ["Madam Pomfrey, the matron, was a nice woman, but very strict.", "â€”Description\n", "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"], "description": "Madam Poppy Pomfrey was a British witch and the matron at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[4] She was a very competent nurse, having been in the position for, at least, the last quarter of the 20th century.\n"}
