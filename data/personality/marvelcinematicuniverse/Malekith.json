Stated by Odin to be the most ruthless of his species, Malekith cares deeply about the survival of the Dark Elves as he looked saddened whilst overviewing the wasteland of Svartalfheim and the destroyed ships and corpses of his fallen brothers. In truth, Malekith would sacrifice his own men if it were to help in achieving his goals, in a final slight to make sure the Asgardians suffered as much as they did, destroyed his ships with countless Dark Elves still within and the collective damage on the surface of the planet, culminated in Malekith destroying more of his species than the Asgardians did. He also Kursed his second-in-command, Algrim.\n"], "quotes": [["\"Through their sacrifice we will survive. It will not be in vain.\"", "â€•Malekith[src]"]], "figure_captions": []}
