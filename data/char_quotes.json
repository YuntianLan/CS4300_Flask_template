Pity the living and above all, those who live without love.", "We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me. But should he fail, I should presume the Dark Lord will turn to you. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely.", "There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.", "On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find. Harry himself. There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind. A part of Voldemort lives inside him.", "Yes. Yes... he must die.", "Don't tell me now that you've grown to care for the boy.", "Lily... after all this time?", "Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry.

Whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is for the moment unclear. Pray he remains ignorant.", "Read it, control it, unhinge it. In the past it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure to invade the minds of his victims, creating visions designed to torture them into madness. Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony, only when he had them litterly begging for death would he finally... kill them.

Brilliant... but scary.", "Hel-!", "Yeah.", "What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?", "I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads... or maybe you didn't notice? There were three!", "Kill us faster? Oh, now I can relax!", "I think we've had a bad influence on her.", "This is light?", "It's spooky! She knows more about you than you do!", "I'm Ron by the way, Ron Weasley.", "So... so it's true! I mean, do you really have the... the...", "Wicked!", "You see it, don't you, Harry? Once I make my move, the Queen will take me. Then you're free to check the King.", "Do you want to stop Snape from getting that stone or not?", "Harry, it's you that has to go on, I *know* it. Not me, not Hermione, YOU.", "Check.", "Mind you, we did save her life!", "Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.", "And to think, I've been worrying about my potions final.", "You have *got* to start standing up to people, Neville.", "'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark Wizard Grindelwald in 1945-'", "'-for his discovery of the 12 uses of Dragon Blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel!'", "I'm ready!

Before...", "Whoa!", "Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid, fat rat yellow!", "Wingardium leviosar!", "It's for your own good, you know.", "I'll be right back.", "Wanna play chess?", "Wanna go and visit Hagrid?", "I know what you're thinking Harry, but don't. There's something not right about that mirror.", "That's wizard's chess.", "Mental that one, I'm telling you.", "Fluffy?", "Happy Christmas, Harry.", "I look good!", "Hey, pea brain!", "What?", "Wingardium Leviosa!", "Do you really have that... scar?", "Why spiders? Why couldn't it be \"follow the butterflies\"?", "Um... Ron Weasley.", "Lockhart's memory charm backfired! He hasn't got a clue who he is!", "No.", "It's not much, but it's home.", "That would be a cheerful visit. \"Hello Hagrid! Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?\"", "My wand. Look at my wand.", "Three guesses who.", "Who cares?", "Come on, Harry. Fred and George were just having a laugh.", "Okay, so half the school thinks you're nipping off to the Chamber of Secrets every night. Who cares?", "Why would that make anyone feel any better?", "If it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?", "And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.", "Follow the spiders? Follow the spiders? If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him!", "I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?", "Ginny. She's been talking about you all summer. Bit annoying, really.", "They were starving him, Mum! There were bars on his window!", "Harry!", "Can we panic now?", "Where's Hermione when you need her?", "Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be 60 feet long, or more.", "Look at your tail.", "Have you spoken to Hermione?", "Moaning Myrtle!", "Uh-oh. I smell trouble.", "Those are Nimbus Two-Thousand and Ones! How'd you get those?", "You'll pay for that one Malfoy! Eat slugs!", "Do you think it's true? Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?", "Of course! You heard him. 'You'll be next mudbloods'.", "Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girls lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?", "Why?", "But, it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it would just go right through you.", "Are you mad?", "You're a parselmouth! Why didn't you tell us?", "Oh, that's what you said to it?", "I head you speaking parseltongue. Snake language.", "Exactly! Now the whole school is gonna think you're his great-great-great-grandson or something.", "Dad loves muggles. Thinks they're fascinating.", "Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.", "Maybe we could trick them into telling.", "Is there anything you CAN do?", "Eugh... essence of Crabbe...", "How thick could you get?", "Brilliant!

I'm fine here.", "I didn't mean to open it.", "It was badly wrapped.", "It's Scabbers who did it.", "He's my rat, sir. Well he's not really a rat. Well, he was a rat, he was my brother Percy's rat, but then they gave him an owl, and I got...", "Sure...", "Oh yeah... well, Harry's got a sort of wonky cross... that's trials and suffering. And, uh, that there could be the sun, and that's happiness, so... you're gonna suffer... but you're gonna be happy about it...", "Who do you think that is?", "Do you know everything?", "How is it she knows everything?", "Oh.", "Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.", "Brilliant! Loads of cool stuff. Mummies, tombs. Even Scabbers enjoyed himself.", "Yeah, along with the dung beetle.", "Bloody hell!", "I'm warning you Hermione! Keep that bloody beast of yours away from Scabbers or I'll turn it into a tea cozy!", "A cat? Is that what they told you? It looks more like a pig with hair if you ask me.", "He's got a point, you know.", "Probably Neville's forgotten the password again.", "Oh... You're there...", "What the bloody hell was that all about?", "So painful. They... they might chop it.", "It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to chopped off.", "Brilliant!", "I still think it's brilliant.", "That's not true!", "Thick-heads.", "Harry, what did you just do?", "Gorgeous. Unless of course you've been ripped to pieces.", "I haven't lost anything! Your cat killed him!", "Harry, you've seen the way that blood thirsty beast of hers is always lurking about. And now Scabbers is gone!", "Your cat killed him!", "Did.", "Hermione, when did you get here?", "It's sorta painful. They uh, they might... chop it.", "It's too late, it's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off.", "Serves her right. She was a terrible singer...", "Let me get this strait. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban to come after you?", "Sure. Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before, and he's a murderous raving lunatic.", "I haven't shown anyone!", "Well, you sort of went rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.", "No... I felt weird though, like I'd never be cheerful again.", "Listen to the idiot! He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?", "There's something moving out there.", "Neville, you're supposed to stroke it!", "You fell off your broom.", "There's something else you should know, Harry. Your Nimbus - when it blew away? - it sort of landed in the Whomping Willow. And well...", "Shove off, Malfoy.", "Harry, it's a trap! And he's a dog, he's an Animagus!", "Not good, brilliant!", "Harry! What did you just do?", "Me? He's mental!", "Scabbers has been in my family for...", "So what?", "What are you trying to do to him?", "Scabbers! Leave him alone!", "Get off him! What are you doing?", "There's no one like Krum! He's like a bird the way he rides the wind! He's more than an athlete! He's an artist.", "Shut up!", "No, we would not care to join you and *Victor*.", "He's from Durmstrang! You're fraternizing with the enemy!", "I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind. He's using you.", "Doubt it. He's way too old.", "Yeah, that's what I think.", "Go on.", "Well... that... that's completely off the point...", "Blimey, Dad! How far up are we?", "Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons. If you can't get a date, who can?", "What? Now I'm really depressed. Oi, Hermione... you're a girl.", "Come with one of us! It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone, but for a girl it's just sad.", "Bloody hell. She's lying, right?", "Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?", "Yeah, didn't think so. Oh well, what's life without a few dragons?", "Oh, I won't. You know I won't.", "Don't be silly. There she was, just walking by... you know how I like it when they walk... I couldn't help it... it just sort of slipped out!", "What else? I ran for it!", "Oh look, Mum's sent me something.", "Mum sent me a dress!", "Nose down, Harry. Ginny, this must be for you.", "Dress robes? For what?", "I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.", "I wasn't the only one who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.", "At least I warned you about the dragons.", "No, I did! Don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you! Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought we'd be alright, you know, after you figured that out.", "Yeah... it is, isn't it. I suppose I was a bit distraught.", "Merci...", "Brilliant, isn't he? Completely demented, of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with him. But he's really been there, you know? He's looked evil in the eye!", "Ruddy pumpkin head, isn't he?", "What are those?", "Well, those're all right! No lace, no dodgy little collar...", "Traditional? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie!", "I smell like my great Aunt Tessie!", "Bloody hell!", "Look, nobody liked Crouch. I know this from my father. Loads of people wanted him dead. But, he was a Ministry Official. It's not even like he turned up stiff in Knockturn Alley. He was murdered at Hogwarts. This is a big deal.", "Yeah.", "What do you suppose is on Karkaroff's arm?", "Yeah, that's me. Ron Weasley, Harry Potter's stupid friend!", "Piss off.", "No. Absolutely not.", "Where?", "You think so?", "Anything else?", "Fine.", "We're still a bunch of misfits.", "Don't know...", "Hey, Dad! Where are we going?", "We came back for Harry.", "Loads, according to Dad. That's what worries them so much. It happened right under their noses.", "Well... my dad did tell me about one. The Imperius Curse?", "What?", "Yeah, yeah a bit."], "Zacharias_Smith": ["Why?", "So Dumbledore says because he says! The point is, where's the proof?"], "Horace_Slughorn": ["Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry?", "Aaauughh!... Merlin's beard, Harry!", "Yes, I did actually!... What made you think that?", "Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer!... Not that I'm familiar with any such back alley transactions, but one does hear rumors. My own interests are purely academic, of course.", "Harry! I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!", "What makes you say that?", "I would have thought an expert potion-maker like yourself could whip up an antidote for a love potion in no time, Harry?", "Perhaps you're right.", "How sweet! I once had a fish... Francis. He was very dear to me. One afternoon, I came downstairs and... it vanished. Poof.", "Yes, doesn't it? But that's life! I suppose, you - you go along with and suddenly... poof.", "What about you, Miss Granger? What do your parents do in the muggle world?", "And is that considered a dangerous profession?", "Whoops! All hands on deck, there, Granger!", "Thank you for the pineapple, you're quite right, it is my favorite - but how did you know?", "What's the matter with Wenby?", "Very well. Better bring him in. I'd have thought you could have whipped up a remedy for this in no time, Harry.", "Perhaps you're right.", "Please don't think badly of me when you see it. You have no idea what he was like... even back then.", "Perhaps you're right Harry.", "Oh, thank you. It's all in the upholstry.", "I come about the stuffing naturally.", "What you see here before you is a curious little potion. It does cause infatuation or obsession.", "Now, Amortentia doesn't create actual love, that would be impossible. But it does cause powerful infatuation or obsession, and for that reason... it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room.", "Some of your classmates... well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf.", "Anyone who aspires to be anyone ends up here. But then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry?", "Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers whilst he was here at Hogwarts.", "I... of course, it's only natural you should want to know more. But I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry. When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet, albeit brilliant boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard. Not unlike others I've known. Not unlike yourself, in fact. If the monster existed, it was buried deep within."], "Viktor_Krum": ["You have no business here! This tent is for champions, and friends."], "Harry_Potter": ["It's alright Ginny, It's over. It's just a memory.", "Malfoy?", "No Colin! Get out of the way!", "Come on, let's take him to Hagrid's.", "He'll know what to do.", "You wish.", "Your family?", "What terrible things? Who's plotting them?", "I can't. Hogwarts is my home!", "This connection between me and Voldemort... what if the reason for it is that I am becoming more like him? I just feel so angry, all the time. What if after everything that I've been through, something's gone wrong inside me? What if I'm becoming bad?", "Wet. I mean, she was sort of crying.", "How come you're not at the feast?", "That's awful!", "Do you want any help finding them?", "Are you sure you don't want any help looking?", "First we've got to find a place to practice where Umbridge won't find out.", "It's too small.", "What's that?", "I'm not going to talk about Cedric, so if that's why you're here you might as well clear out now.", "C'mon, Hermione, let's go. They're just here because they think I'm some sort of freak.", "Wait... look, it all sounds *great* when you say it like that. But the truth is most of that was just luck. I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I nearly always had help...", "No, Hermione, I'm not! Facing this stuff in real life is not like school. In school, if you make a mistake you can just try again tomorrow. But out there, when you're a second away from being murdered or watching a friend die right before your eyes... you don't know what that's like.", "Look, it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you, but - but I've got you into enough trouble as it is.", "...So how are we going to get to London?", "This is mad. Who'd want to be taught by me? I'm a nutter, remember?", "Thanks, Ron.", "I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.", "That even though we've got a fight ahead of us, we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.", "Something worth fighting for.", "We're going to make them proud, Neville. That's a promise.", "No you don't.", "It's my fault.", "The prophecy said neither one can live while the other one survives. It means one of us is going to have to kill the other, in the end.", "Why didn't you tell me?", "Are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day.", "Cedric *did* know this stuff. He was really good. It's just, Voldemort was better.", "Probably full of Nargles, though.", "I've no idea.", "I've waited fourteen years...", "Think I can wait a little longer. NOW!", "Thanks. Seems you're about the only ones that do.", "What do you mean?", "Nothing.", "No. Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now. Anyway, I don't want to give Umbridge the satisfaction.", "Yeah, well I haven't got any of those, have I Ron?", "No, it's not! Hermione whatever this is, it's not simple. You don't understand.", "What? No, I'm staying with you!", "You mean, like a weapon?", "Good! I want to join! If Voldemort's raising an army then I want to fight!", "Well, what use is that? If we're gonna be attacked, it won't be risk-free.", "And how's theory supposed to prepare us for what's out there?", "It's not a lie! I saw him! I fought him!", "So according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead OF HIS OWN ACCORD.", "There's a lot of that going around, Hermione. So what is this place?", "You couldn't have put this in a letter, I suppose. I've gone all summer without a scrap of news.", "Only what?", "I think you've got an admirer.", "It's brilliant! It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back!", "Don't say a word against my father!", "I'm not weak!", "My father was a great man!", "So, you've known someone who died?", "I'm sorry.", "How many times?", "You haven't given me any ink.", "That. Pulling the carriage.", "I'm sorry, Professor. But I must not tell lies.", "CRUCIO!", "Yeah, but I agreed. I tried so hard to help, and all it's done is made things worse. Anyway, it doesn't matter anymore, because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much. The more you care the more you have to lose. You maybe it's just best to...", "To go it alone.", "Hey Big D. Beat up another 10 year old?", "Five against one. That's very brave.", "Why?", "But that's insane! No one in their right mind could believe that Dumbledore...", "JUST STAY AWAY FROM ME!", "I saw it! It's just like with Mr. Weasley! It's the same door I've been dreaming about for months, only I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before! Sirius said Voldemort was after something, something he didn't have last time, and it's in the department of Mysteries!", "What if he is? I'm supposed to just let him die? Hermione, he's the only family I've got left!", "Different.", "Why not?", "And your mum believes them?", "Oh, well I guess you should read the Prophet then, like your stupid mother. It'll tell you everything you need to know.", "I'll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar!", "You mean if he knows about it then, he'll be able to read my mind.", "What are you doing?", "But the letter said...", "Hearing?", "I didn't...", "Sirius, what are you doing here? If somebody sees you...", "I just don't want to see you get shut back in Azkaban.", "Expelliarmus!", "I don't understand. What has the Ministry of Magic got against me?", "Oh... yeah.", "But I am the Chosen One.", "Sorry... kidding!", "She's smart... funny... attractive...", "Well you know... she has nice... skin.", "Well, I dunno, I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.", "I-I've never thought about it before. But now that you mention it, yeah. Very nice.", "Not to mention the pincers...", "Quiet, please.", "Thanks.", "Excellent... really excellent!", "Right. I'm going down to Hagrid's.", "I know, but I've got a really good feeling about Hagrid's. I feel like it's the place to be tonight. Do you know what I mean?", "Trust me! I know what I'm doing, or Felix does.", "Hi!", "It feels like this.", "Divine. Had ourselves a little late night snack, did we?", "Or twenty.", "Honestly, you know, I reckon she was starting to annoy you.", "Oh... brilliant.", "Well, I'd bloody well hope so, she's been snogging you for three months.", "Who are you talking about?", "Okay, very funny.", "What was that for?", "Alright, fine, you're in love with her! Have you ever actually met her?", "Yes. What does it mean?", "Um... have you ever fixed a nose before?", "...Okay, yeah, sure, give it a go.", "Augh...!", "Well? How do I look?", "...Brilliant.", "Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years.", "Through the front door sir.", "Incarcerous!", "Fight back!, you coward! Fight back!", "Sectumsempra!", "Oh, sorry, sir, I should've announced myself. Cleared my throat. Coughed. You probably feared I was Professor Sprout!", "Oh, well, just the general behavior, sir - the sneaking around, jumping when you saw me... Are those tentacular leaves, sir? They're very valuable, aren't they?", "Personally, these plants always kind of freak me out.", "That would be counterproductive, sir!", "No idea!", "Oh, no one. Bit of a tosser, really.", "Sorry, sir, but I really should be getting back to the party. My date...", "Oh no, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant, but we're friends.", "Sorry I made you miss the carriages by the way, Luna.", "Oh, I am your friend, Luna.", "Well, sir, I think this called for a more practiced hand.", "I don't sleep with it!", "Poof.", "But, Sir, I thought we weren't allowed to apparate on Hogwarts' grounds.", "I just apparated, didn't I?", "I never noticed how beautiful this place is.", "No I'm not!", "What happens when you break an Unbreakable Vow?", "I'm not coming back Hermione. I've got to finish whatever Dumbledore started, and I don't know where that'll lead me, but I'll let you and Ron know where I am when I can.", "Did you know, sir? Then?", "That's not what it sounded like.", "What brings you here, sir?", "I'd have thought that this called for a more practised hand, sir.", "Fight back, you cowards, fight back!", "Quiet, please!", "Thanks. Alright, um, now then, remember just because you made the team last year, that doesn't guarantee you a spot this year, is that clear?", "Good.", "All right, fine, you're in love with her! You haven't even met her!", "But I am the Chosen One.", "Okay, sorry... kidding.", "Hd ourselves a little midnight snack, have we?", "Or twenty.", "Honestly, you know, I reckon she was starting to annoy you.", "Oh, yes. Very nice.", "Well, she's funny, smart, attractive.", "She has nice... skin.", "I reckon he's right.", "Shelf, sir?", "Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?", "You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.", "What was he like?", "I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me. He killed my parents.", "Ron, you don't have a wife.", "Absolutely not, no. Besides, I'm just a waste of space. Isn't that right, Vernon?", "Thanks.", "They'll torture you. If they think for a moment you know where I'm going, they'll stop at nothing.", "Well, just keep talking about that little ball of light touching your heart, and she'll come 'round.", "No, of course not. How are you, Luna?", "Very nice to meet you, sir.", "What?", "How about you tell me now?", "Maybe that's the best reason to have it. Because of everything that's going on.", "Hermione... I appreciate the thought, honestly. But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...", "No one else is going to die. Not for me.", "It was you!", "And the doe. That was you as well.", "My Patronus is a stag.", "Merry Christmas, Hermione.", "This is mental.", "Ron! Don't listen to it!", "Ron! Stab it!", "Ron! It lies! Stab it! STAB IT!", "What's the trace?", "The real one?", "No, absolutely not.", "How did you find us?", "\"It\"?", "Engorgio!", "Reducio!", "No. This is where I was born. I'm not returning as someone else.", "Same.", "You think I'm not listening too? You think I don't know how this feels?", "Fine then, go! Go then! Leave the locket.", "Forgive me minister, but it's a little hard to tell the difference now-a-days.", "I don't care about a bloody wedding! No matter whose it is.

Or is it just happening inside my head?", "Okay, there's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle, and it may help us defeat You-Know-Who.", "We don't know.", "We don't know that either. I realise that's not much to go on.", "I'm going there now.", "There's a reason I can hear them... the Horcruxes. I think I've known for awhile.", "And I think you have too.", "No. Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it's just him.", "Albus Severus Potter... you were named for two Headmasters of Hogwarts.

It will always fail you!", "But what if that wand never belonged to Snape? What if its allegiance was always to someone else? C'mon, Tom... let's finish this the way we started it. Together!", "I'll lure him into the castle.

You didn't say anything.", "Hermione, give me a flask, anything!", "Come on Tom, let's finish this the way we started, together.", "It's good to see you too, Professor.", "Time. As much as you can get me, Professor.", "It's complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault?", "Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.", "Why should he...", "I trusted him.", "He knows if we find them, and destroy all the horcruxes we'll be able to kill him. I reckon he'll stop at nothing to make sure we don't find the rest. There's more, one of them is at Hogwarts.", "There's something hidden here in the castle, and it may help us defeat you-know-who.", "I'm afraid it's quite extensive, how dare you stand where he stood. Tell them how it happened that night! Tell them how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you, and killed him! Tell them!", "It answered to somebody else. When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his, but the thing is, the wand never belonged to Snape. It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night in the Astronomy Tower.

It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm.

As clear and tasteless as water, it leaves no trace.", "Some dear friend, no doubt, but which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy.

You must be thirsty.", "I promise you, it isn't poison.", "Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?", "Not so much, my lord. I would save the rest if I were you. Hide it.

Cersei will keep her close. The rest of your household are... all dead, it grieves me to say. I do so hate the sight of blood.", "And would again, my lord.

When you look at me, do you see a hero?", "What madness led you to tell the queen you'd learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?", "Ah, the children. It's always the innocents who suffer. It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.

Is that a precious thing to you?", "To find so lovely a creature working in your father's kitchens - it almost beggars belief.", "You will be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.", "And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?", "Well played, my lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle... the small council grows smaller every day.", "Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?", "Three great men sit in a room", "Does it? He has neither crown, nor gold, nor favor with the gods.", "But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?", "Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick. A shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.", "My Lord Hand, Commander. I must compliment on the Gold Cloaks' performance these last few weeks.", "Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted.", "No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.", "I am trying.", "Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you.", "I wish we could, too.", "If we're going to play, you'll have to start.", "A most highborn plumber.", "You're quite good at being Hand, you know. Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played.

I admired her father.", "I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter.", "You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.", "Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.", "Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.", "Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army?", "Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most, and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North.", "Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?", "Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.", "You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution.", "My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence.", "A little obvious, perhaps.", "Might I sit?", "You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.", "Is she?", "She has, sadly.

Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.", "What have you done?", "Quickly.", "Trust me, my friend. I brought you this far.", "No. I only know what it's like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.", "You have your father's instincts for politics and you have compassion.", "I never said you were perfect.", "The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen but gentler than Stannis.

I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother, a woman he didn't even know! So I prayed to all Seven Gods \"Let the boy live.

Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark? I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. But me, though... my life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint.", "Of course.

I would've come to your defense, but...", "You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you.", "It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another. Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Aha!", "I didn't mean to give offense, My Lady. Forgive me.", "Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?", "Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?", "I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you can beat me in a fair fight?", "The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.", "If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens.", "I took you for a fighter, a man - oh, pardon - woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid.", "I wish someone would have told me, I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.", "Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?", "But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.", "For stealing a pig?", "It's a tough decision. Take the bridge and risk being seen, or cross the great water.", "Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us, or I could escape down the river.", "It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?", "Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.", "Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?", "So how shall we pass the time?", "It's going to be a very dull walk.", "No one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life?", "A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword.", "All the good it's done her.", "I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they would never have taken us.", "I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.", "I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.", "You were not beating me.", "My father...", "When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these men have ever been with a noblewomen. You'd be wise not to resist.", "They'll knock your teeth out.", "No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you, do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you.", "I'm dying.", "Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.", "I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.", "Now get out.", "This one suits me fine.", "Don't worry. I'm not interested.", "If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bath tub.", "You swore a solemn vow, remember? You are supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.", "That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most...", "I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.", "I trust you.", "There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?", "The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city. Beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey sunken cunt. \"You can trust the Lannisters,\" he said \"The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown\". So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. \"Burn them all,\" he said \"Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds\". Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?", "First, I killed the pyromancer. And then, when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. \"Burn them all,\" he kept saying \"Burn them all\". I don't think he expected to die. He... he meant to... burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me.", "No milk of the poppy.", "I'll scream.", "I'll scream loudly.", "Lord Bolton... is there word from the capital?", "I owe you a debt.", "You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it.", "Days?", "Yes, there she is. And?", "To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.", "Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication.", "What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?", "Ser Loras, it's quite all right.", "Your sister looks very beautiful.", "So... looking forward to your wedding?", "Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.", "Perhaps they should get married.", "If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep.", "If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her.", "My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.", "Is this place safe?", "Uh-huh.", "Ahh! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard's down.", "If I still had my right hand...", "Come on, then.", "I'm not hungry.", "No, I'll do it. Leave us.", "I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own arse?", "I'm not Father, I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...", "With whom? You? Men talk. As soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone.", "Move away!", "Joffrey! Joffrey!", "Joffrey!", "You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.", "They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?", "You know what's coming?", "Now that you mention it, she did ask.", "Depends. Did you do it?", "\"The Kingslayer Brothers\". You like it? I like it.", "Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother?", "How can I help you?", "You know I can't.", "What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.", "Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king. Freeing you is treason.", "Which is why we're having a trial.", "Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.", "She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?", "To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post, covered in my own shit, for months.", "Maybe a bit.", "I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.", "Mmm. It's yours.", "It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe.", "What?", "You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.", "I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her.", "I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told her to fuck off?", "Catelyn Stark's dead.", "You're going to be found guilty.", "When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and asked to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.", "My father isn't Joffrey. He'll keep his word.", "Do you trust me?", "Keep your mouth shut, no more outbursts. This will all be over soon.", "You condemned your own son to death.", "This isn't a trial, it's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.", "You always hated Tyrion.", "As did I! Do you know the last order the 'Mad King' gave me? It was to bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?", "Justice?", "He will be executed.", "Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.", "What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?", "It survives, through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard, I'll take my place as your son and heir, if you let Tyrion live.", "You have my word.", "He's willing to sacrifice any of us.", "Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.", "Beheading.", "Of course. Wet nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.", "Nothing made YOU happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.", "The joke wore thin, though.", "I had other interests.", "Why?", "Every day around the world, men, women and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?", "He was twice your size.", "I don't know.", "Good luck today.", "Is that any way to speak about our mother?", "No.", "You should be happy to go back then.", "Varys set him free.", "He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards.", "I like to improvise.", "We don't choose who we love. It just... well... it's beyond our control. I sound like an idiot.", "What I'm trying to say, what I'm trying and failing to say...", "No, I'm afraid you don't.", "Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate. Fuck everyone who isn't us.", "The gods won't mind. They've spilled more blood than all of us combined.", "And you'll get all three. \"A Lannister always - \"", "You have better instincts than anyone else in the Lannister army.", "Get word to the Blackfish. I want to parley.", "He's an old man.", "Someone certainly does.", "You're an anointed knight! There's quite a difference.", "If you surrender, I'll spare the loves of your men. On my honor.", "Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home.", "Have you ever met the Blackfish?", "He's even more stubborn than you are.", "I never thought you'd find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.", "In my experience, girls like her don't live very long.", "Not my type.", "They're not good at anything. I know the ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves.", "Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.", "We couldn't. He was a useless old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies.

I do, My Lady.", "When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goat shit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged, and I escaped justice. When I was twelve I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake, I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel...", "Mord! Turn-key! Mord! Mord!", "How would you like to be rich?", "Well, I don't have it HERE.", "About the gold...", "When they captured me, they took my purse, but the gold is still mine!", "Where? I don't know where...", "...but when they free me...", "Have you ever heard the phrase \"rich as a Lannister\"?", "...to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold... if you deliver the message, and I live, which I very much intend to do.", "Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.", "In my own bed, at the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.", "If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.", "Starve, most likely.", "What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women? Gold and women? Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not a moment longer. But you knew that. That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.", "Though I would treasure your friendship, I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder. And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this", "And here we have Bronn, son of...", "It's not a pleasant story.", "Didn't last long", "Not quite. First my father had Jaime tell me the truth", "Really? I was sixteen, drunk and in love.", "As I said, I was young and stupid.", "What do I want from you? I want you to share my tent. I want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. I want you to take no other man to bed as long as we're together. And I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be.", "Ferocious? Last night, a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate but even still, Olf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunther refuse to pay.", "Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort!", "Stay low?", "I was born lucky.", "Half wrong.", "Half wrong. I'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.", "And do what?", "Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?", "You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality - that and your cheekbones.", "And so did the country.", "Tell me, when your men slaughtered Ned Stark's men at the throne room, did you give the orders?", "I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence.", "\"Dwarf\"? You should have stopped at \"imp\". And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you like to take it from my friend here.", "I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war. And seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.", "The queen regent. And you are a fool to believe she is your friend.", "No, we shall not.", "There's a ship leaving for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful... in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way.", "His name is Bronn, and he is the new commander of the City Watch.", "I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling than that.", "As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon.", "She was my mother too.", "Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.", "Good. One of my better ideas.", "The council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.", "Why? Am I about to hear one?", "Depends on the sellsword.", "He has a sword, the power of life and death.", "I've decided I don't like riddles.", "You disappoint me, Grand Maester.", "So loyal that you told the queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.", "See, I told Varys that I was giving the princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger I planned to wed her to Robyn Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you.", "Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.", "Well make do!", "Oh, and remember...", "Myrcella is a princess. Some would say she was born for this.", "Dorne is the safest place for her.", "That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.", "A guest.", "What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?", "Someone get the girl something to cover herself with.", "For what crimes? She's not fighting her brother's battle, you halfwit.", "The Mad King did as he like. Has your uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?", "I'm not threatening the king, Ser, I'm educating my nephew.", "Bronn, the next time the Ser Meryn speaks, kill him.", "THAT was a threat. See the difference?", "I apologize for my nephew's behaviour. Tell me the truth, do you want to end this engagement?", "Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.", "It's hard to argue with his assessment.", "The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.", "Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later.", "She'll be safer in Dorne.", "It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl, and I don't blame her at all for you.", "Schemes and plots are the same thing.", "Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?", "That's a lie right there.", "Tell me", "The smart money would be on \"more likely\".", "But then, perhaps his own unnatural urges would give him sympathy for yours.", "I suppose there's only one way to find out.", "When did she tell you this?", "Swear to me on what?", "But I don't care about your life.", "All right, all right, enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out.", "Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me.", "I remember reading an old sailor's proverb. Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off.", "Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.", "Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour.", "That's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.", "And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money.", "Oh you blind, bloody fool!", "We've had vicious kings, and we've had idiot kings, but I don't think we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king!", "I can, I am!", "The threw a cow pie at you so you decide to kill them all? They're starving, you fool! All because of a war you started!", "And now I've struck a king! Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl?", "If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back! You owe him quite a bit, you know!", "It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.", "It's just you, me, and Joffrey. The Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.", "He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead...", "I thought the girls might help him.", "I was wrong!", "I did not know.", "For questioning?", "We talked about this.", "To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?", "A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you.", "Imagine Stannis' terror.", "You're an intelligent man. I like to think I'm an intelligent man.", "I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men.", "What do you want? Tell me.", "My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock.", "The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. Never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand...", "I do. Last thing I expected.", "I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.", "The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned. The Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?", "We should sail there immediately.", "A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.", "One game at a time, my friend.", "You're in the Kingsguard, Clegane. We must beat them back or they're going to take the city... your king's city.", "Don't fight for a king. Don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor, don't fight for glory, don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in it will be your house that burns. Your gold he steals, your women he rapes. Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them!", "Sir Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the King that the Hand is extremely busy.", "That would make me the quarter-man. Just doesn't have the same ring to it.", "A wedding.", "Nor you, my friend.", "Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.", "Oh, \"enhances\". Fancy word for a sellsword.", "Oh, fuck me.", "Will you?", "Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.", "I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles, but he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir.", "It is mine by right.", "Still makes me more clever than you.", "I thought we were friends.", "How much?", "Double?", "I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.", "What are they doing here?", "No, I don't think so.", "They stay outside!", "Baelish doesn't have friends.", "Oh, Ros? The redhead?", "I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.", "Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things.", "Oh, please.", "All right, yes, I fucked her once.", "Twice.", "But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else.", "Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?", "Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?", "We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name.", "Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing to other men, and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you.", "I don't even want to talk about her.", "Only because you're making me!", "This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.", "Mmm, yes.", "Only if you stop.", "Master of Coin?", "I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it.", "Ah, the return of the conquering hero.", "Does he have a little jaunt in his step?", "You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth - or should I say my money's worth.", "It was a gift, Podrick! This is more than I give you in a year.", "Oh. Then it's much more than I give you in a year.", "Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They're happy enough to take it when I give it to them.", "What did you do to them?", "And they seemed to like these things?", "Only they weren't paid.", "Is that what you're telling us?", "Sit down, Podrick.", "We're going to need details. Copious details.", "For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician", "No.", "Worse", "We can't afford to pay it back. That's what's wrong with it. The Crown owes millions to my father.", "Forgive a debt? My father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.", "Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed-upon period of time, you return it with interest.", "Well, you have to.", "This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about, it's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the Bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back.", "Podrick?", "After a long consultation with my colleague, Ser Bronn, I've finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod...", "...have you ever been with a woman?", "Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.", "A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say? Now, as it happens Marei...", "...is quite the spear-handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around us.", "Kayla...", "...is famous from here to Volantis... in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.", "She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as \"my Lord.\" Be back in time for my supper.", "And if I refuse?", "Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.", "It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.", "It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word \"extravagant\" has been used.", "I understand that.", "But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense.", "And... we're at war, Lady Olenna.", "Yes, and maintaining supply lines...", "And we are so grateful for your contributions, which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.", "I would.", "My lady...", "Quite sufficient, thank you.", "What is she doing here?", "You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the Crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.", "I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.", "Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.", "It wasn't my best, but I thought...", "Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.", "The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?", "And how do we do that?", "Wonderful.", "You can't mean it.", "Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you want her to give her to me? That's cruel even for you.", "She's a child!", "I don't suppose there is anything we can do about this?", "It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of the arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.", "Where to begin... this is awkward.", "A tall child.", "Not that young.", "Older.", "Shae's not going to like it.", "I should never have told you about that.", "Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.", "I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.", "Rather less than I planned to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?", "And?", "What did you once call me? \"A drunken little lust-fulled beast.\"", "Stop. I can't. I could, I won't.", "If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start... I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to.", "Do you drink wine?", "There will be no bedding ceremony.", "There will be no bedding ceremony.", "Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock!", "A bad joke Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there.", "I am. Guilty.", "But... but it is my wedding night. My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do.", "Come, wife.", "I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood.", "Oh, \"monster\". Perhaps you should speak to me more softly then. Monsters are dangerous and, just now, kings are dying like flies.", "No, it's a very good lesson only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions.", "When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?", "You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.", "A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.", "No. I think armies give you power.", "My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Half-Man, the Demon-Monkey, the Imp.", "The disgraced daughter and the demon monkey. We're perfect for each other.", "Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man?", "I'm all for cheating. This is war. But to slaughter them at a wedding...", "How long does it go on?", "Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more.", "You have children. How happy would you say you are?", "Even Joffrey?", "Keep up!", "It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.", "The Northerners will never forget.", "Who? Whom?", "Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.", "I am the Imp; I have certain standards to maintain.", "\"Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.\" Is that bad poetry, or is it supposed to mean something?", "Sansa...", "Why sheep shift?", "My lady...", "Oh, they take all kinds.", "The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.", "Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I've grown rather used to being the family insult.", "Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?", "I thought we were speaking truth.", "It wasn't actually...", "I've heard rumors.", "I wasn't there. I don't know what...", "Let's toast to Lanisters children", "Please don't.", "Better her than you.", "Your new hand is nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?", "Gilded steel. Not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away, my brother starves himself...", "You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough since one killed Robert for her.", "A toast. To the proud Lannister children", "It's only wine.", "What about your left?", "You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?", "Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand.", "You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one.", "Hello.", "A toast. To the proud Lannister children", "You saw her board the ship?", "And you saw the ship sail away?", "How do you know?", "If it please, your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired...", "Your Grace?", "Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?", "Are you going to accept their offer?", "Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet.", "Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that.", "I will *not* have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted.", "Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late.", "Pod!", "This is farewell.", "Pod.", "There has never lived a more loyal squire.", "Mm, my trial for regicide, yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count, and that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.", "So should I turn around and close my eyes?", "You're really asking if I killed your son?", "Well, you can set me free.", "Then there's really nothing else to say.", "Except I didn't do it!", "Sansa couldn't have done this.", "No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway.", "Is that supposed to make me feel better?", "It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?", "How do you think? Her son died in her arms.", "\"Her\" son?", "Father, I wish to confess. I wish to confess!", "Yes, father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?", "No. Of that, I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I'm guilty of being a dwarf.", "Oh, yes I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life.", "Nothing but this", "I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had! Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores!", "I wish I was the monster you think I am! I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you! I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it!", "I will not give my life for Joffery's murder and I know I'll get no justice here, so I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.", "Not going well, is it?", "Oh! You think so?", "Ned Stark was promised the same thing, and we both know how that turned out.", "How do you know?", "I think I would have remembered that.", "You and my family have more in common than you might admit.", "That would have made things so much easier.", "If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.", "Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son.", "Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.", "She's dim-witted.", "When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?", "And you understand the rules of inheritance?", "She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.", "You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?", "Is it two wives you want or two castles?", "I'm a bit short on castles at the moment, but I can offer you gold and gratitude.", "You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.", "My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it.", "Does he frighten you so much?", "Because you're my friend.", "I understand.", "Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.", "Yes, we did.", "I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?", "What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?", "Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.", "Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?", "Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.", "Nothing made him happier.", "On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.", "For you. You drifted away.", "Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson.", "I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him \"Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?\". He gave me an answer \"Smath the beetles. Smath 'em. kun kun kun\".", "I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library.", "Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him, the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand, but he wasn't mindless, he had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began spending inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of \"kun kun kun\". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No, I heard \"kun kun kun\". And I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know because it was horrible, that all these beetles would be dying for no reason.", "I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once.", "He just pushed me aside with a \"kun\" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him.", "So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?", "Oh, get on with it, you son of a whore!", "All my life you've wanted me dead.", "I loved her.", "Shae.", "I murdered her. With my own hands.", "Doesn't matter?", "I am your son and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn't poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?", "I can't go back there. She's in there.", "I am your son. I have always been your son.", "I'm sorry... I'm sorry.", "Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?", "Compassion. Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands and I shot my own father with a crossbow.", "Good luck finding him.", "What is it that you want exactly?", "Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place.", "Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?", "Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't imagine they revoke your nobility for killing a whore, it must happen all the time.", "I still don't see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.", "In a box. Why stop now?", "She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me.", "I didn't rule. I was a servant.", "Managed to kill a lot of people.", "Because I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.", "You're right. No point.", "I find us repulsive.", "I need to speak to someone with hair.", "I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.", "It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.", "I have to get out of this wheelhouse.", "I have to get out of this wheelhouse.", "Mmm. I have to get out of this wheelhouse.", "I am losing my mind.", "Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros.", "What am I?", "One more drunk dwarf.", "No need to worry. I was just...", "Oh, thought you were someone else. Show's almost over. I'm sure there are girls inside who'd be happy to oblige.", "You've made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you're doing, and then...", "I have to ask - how *exactly* were you serving your Queen in a whorehouse half a world away? Is it possible that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away?", "Oh, wait. You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me. I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys' little birds.", "She found out, didn't she? Found out and exiled you. Now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. Risky scheme. One might even say desperate. You think Daenerys will execute me and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely.", "Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont Way.", "The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then...", "And then they weren't. \"They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -\"", "I would clap.", "Wait. WAIT! Wait, wait! Wait, you can't just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it! He has to know it came from a dwarf! And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?", "Guess again!", "You're an awful traveling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I've ever met.", "We are traveling together, in each other's company, therefore...", "I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate without ever saying a word!", "It never occured to you to ask why until now?

And he was fucking the woman I loved.", "It's true. He has.", "I'm the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister.", "Into your service? Your grace, we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.", "It's a beautiful dream, stopping the wheel. You're not the first person who's ever dreamt it.", "When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all three in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.", "If only I were otherwise.", "It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be, especially when what is has worked out in your favor.", "My father would have liked you.", "In my experience, eloquent men are right. Every bit as often as imbeciles.", "I suppose there's no point asking how you found me.", "Well, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start.

Our Queen does love ships.", "Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise.", "Perhaps we should take shelter.", "Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.", "Well, not all the people, of course.", "We can agree upon that at least.", "You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything, it's all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?", "Good. You're in the great game now. And the great game's terrifying. The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father.", "He wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last.", "For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone's always asking me to believe in things. Family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. so I said, \"no, thank you,\" to belief. And yet, here I am.

Anyway... she's much smarter than she lets on.", "Good.", "I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.", "I don't remember.", "I would never do that... to you.", "I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.", "The war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting... whatever you saw beyond the wall.", "If it doesn't matter, then you might as well kneel.

You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.", "You idiot. You fucking idiot.", "You still have the largest armies.", "Pull Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.

I can't make her decisions for her.", "You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would've been proud.", "Listen to me...", "It'll take you a while with a sparring sword.", "He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am, a little monster sent to punish him!", "Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there's no way around that. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.", "I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Right now, anyway. She has a more important request.", "Last time I was here, I killed my father with a crossbow.", "You're not staying here?", "What if someone takes the boat?", "He'll do.", "He'll do.", "And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.", "A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat or intimidate. That must be difficult for you.", "I didn't know about that...", "Cersei, I didn't know.", "I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words; she wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.", "After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it, in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me!", "All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat, so put an end to me.", "I don't care! I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart, if there's anything left of it.", "If there's no future, then why did you allow me to come?", "Yes, no. Not what you hoped for, but you must've hoped for something.", "Mmm, not like this.", "Yes.", "Because I think she will make the world a better place.", "She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them. That's the difference between you.", "You're pregnant.", "We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands.

With the Bifrost gone, how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here, your precious Earth?", "Did you mourn?", "YOUR father! He DID tell you my true parentage, did he not?", "I remember a shadow, living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss, I who was and should be king!", "Well, yes.", "I've seen worlds you've never known about! I have grown, Odin's Son, in my exile!

I said, KNEEL!", "Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation.

Dreykov's daughter, Sao Paulo, the hospital fire?", "Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it's GUSHING red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child at prayer... PATHETIC! You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers. You pretend to be separate, to have your own code. Something that makes up for the horrors. But they are a part of you, and they will never go away!... I won't touch Barton. Not until I make him kill you!", "...What?", "How will your friends have time for me, when they're so busy fighting you?", "Of course it does. I've come too far anything else.

Betrayed!", "You don't have the Tesseract yet. I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words.", "I know.

You will know peace.", "It's an impressive cage. Not built, I think, for me.", "Oh, I've heard. The mindless beast, makes play he's still a man. How desperate are you, that you call on such lost creatures to defend you?", "Ooh. It burns you to have come so close. To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power. And for what? A warm light for all mankind to share. And then to be reminded what real power is.", "Look, why don't you let me take over? I'm clearly the better pilot!", "You know this is wonderful! This a tremendous idea! Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that! Flying around the city, smash it into everything in sight and everyone will see it! It's brilliant Thor! It's truly brillian...", "You lied to me! I'm impressed.", "You'll kill me? Evidently there will be a line.", "Very well. Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions, given that you seem to like them so much.", "Oh, this is much better. Costume's a bit much... so tight. But the confidence, I can feel the righteousness surging. Hey, you wanna have a rousing discussion about truth,honor, patriotism?

I am Loki of Jotunheim, and I have brought you a gift!", "I only ask for one thing in return; a good seat from which to watch Asgard burn!", "Did she suffer?", "Go on.", "You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?", "Hm. When do we start?", "I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent God, just like you.", "Give or take five thousand years.", "This day, the next, a hundred years, it's nothing! It's a heartbeat. You'll never be ready. The only woman whose love you prized will be snatched from you.", "Satisfaction's not in my nature!", "Thor! After all this time now you come to visit me! Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?", "Now you see me, brother!", "Define worse.", "You are not.", "This is so unlike you, brother. So... clandestine.

You ruined everything! Ask them!", "You have what you wanted. You have the independence you asked for. Ah!", "ouch, ok! I know exactly where he is.", "How was I supposed to know? I can't the see the future. I'm not a witch.", "I'm... honored?", "Like the old days.", "Bold move, brother. Even for me.", "I'm sorry?", "Hi.", "Do you really think it's a good idea to go back to earth?", "Let me rephrase that", "Your savior has arrived!", "You know, I feel it won't make much of a difference...", "...but this time, it's truly nothing personal. The reward for your capture", "will set me up nicely.", "Easier to let it burn.", "Here's the thing. I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar.", "...Did you just agree with me?", "Do you truly think so little of me?", "Maybe not.", "...I am here...", "You do seem like you're in desperate need of leadership.", "Grandmaster, I...", "My dear friend, if you were to give me twelve hours I could bring them both back to you.", "I could do it in one.", "It hurts, doesn't it? Being lied to. Being told you're one thing and then learning it's all a fiction.", "You didn't think I'd really come and see you, did you? This place is disgusting. Does this mean you don't want my help? Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position with Grandmaster, it took me time to win his trust. He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.

And afterward, this cell.", "I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere.

It's impressive.", "Loki's scepter must be here. Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it. At long last.", "No, those are tattoos, this is a brand.", "Oh, no, no, no.

I have a simpler one", "So Earth has wizards now, huh?", "I don't drink tea.", "Not tea.", "Worthy inclusion.", "It's a bit of a long story. Family drama, that kind of thing. But, we're looking for my father.", "Oh, yes. Promptly.", "How did you end up here?", "Yeah, it's called the... uh... Revengers!", "Surtur! Son of... a bitch! You're still alive!

See, I've spent some time on Earth... for the record, I saved the planet a couple of times. Then I went searching through the cosmos for a couple of magic colorful Infinity Stone things... but didn't find any. That's when I came across a path of death, and destruction.

So, where is this crown?", "Oh, that's your crown? I thought it was a big eyebrow.", "Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that thing off your head.", "Oh, that's intense. You know to be honest, seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle.

It's too dangerous!", "Destroyed, by the Empire.", "Only a master of evil, Darth.", "You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down I will become more powerful than you could possibly imagine."], "Darth_Maul": ["Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the homing trace is correct, I will find them quickly, Master.", "At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge."], "Han_Solo": ["Uh, uh... negative, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak, very dangerous.", "Uh...", "Wonderful girl. Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.", "Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.", "Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight. I take orders from just one person", "No reward is worth this.", "Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.", "That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.", "What?", "I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit.", "It is for me, sister. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.", "I'm tryin' not to, kid.", "Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're lookin' for passage to the Alderaan system?", "Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?", "It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. I've outrun Imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers mind you, I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you old man. What's the cargo?", "Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen *anything* to make me believe that there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. 'Cause no mystical energy field controls *my* destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.", "Get in there, you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell!", "Marching into a detention area is not what I had in mind.", "Better her than me!", "I don't what we're gonna do now. Even if I could take off, I could never get past the tractor beam.", "Damn fool, I knew you were going to say that.", "Great shot, kid, that was one in a million!", "YAHOOO!", "You're all clear, kid, now let's blow this thing and go home!", "One thing's for sure, we're all gonna be a lot thinner.", "Great, kid! Don't get cocky.", "Yes, Greedo. I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba I've got his money.", "Yeah, but this time I've got the money.", "Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?", "Over my dead body!", "Yeah, I'll bet you have.", "Sorry about the mess.", "That's right, yeah. Got some old debts I gotta pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. We could use you.", "What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station is not my idea of courage. It's more like, suicide.", "What're you looking at? I know what I'm doing.", "This is *not* gonna work.", "I *did* say so before.", "Garbage chute. Really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there...", "Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here! Now it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.", "It's worse.", "Good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living, that's something else.", "That's your imagination.", "What?", "She'll make point five past lightspeed. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself.", "Bring 'em on, I'd prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.", "Easy? You call that easy?", "Not this ship, sister.", "What's so important? What's he carrying?", "Sure hope the old man got that tractor beam out of commission, or this is gonna be a real short trip. Okay, hit it!", "Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.", "Tell Jabba that I've got his money.", "Yeah, but this time, I've got the money.", "I don't have it WITH me.", "Tell Jabba...", "Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I have a choice.", "Over my dead body.", "Yes, I bet you have.", "Sorry about the mess.", "Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.", "I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous.", "Look out he's loose!", "I'll get him!", "What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like... suicide.", "Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you.", "What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'.", "Where did you dig up that old fossil?", "Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.", "Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em.", "Don't everyone thank me at once.", "Nice! Come on.", "Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.", "Can't get out that way.", "What the-? We've come out of hyperspace, right into a meteor shower... or an asteroid field or something. It's not on any of the charts!", "Our position's correct, except... no Alderaan.", "That's what I'm trying to tell you, kid; it ain't there... It's been totally blown away.", "The entire Starfleet couldn't destroy a whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships, with more firepower than...", "And hope they don't have blasters.", "Stay sharp. There's two more coming in. They're gonna try and cut us off.", "What did you guys do to attract this kind of attention, anyhow?", "Watch the wisecracks, kid, or you're gonna find yourself floating home! I'm nobody's straight-man, not on my own ship!... We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers which ought to shake the more persistent ones.", "I just wish I'd known how *popular* the two of you were.", "Here's where the fun begins!", "It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the nav-com.", "I could override it, but the drive might shred itself.", "Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, farm-boy!", "Ever try calculating a jump to light-speed?", "Didn't think so; well, it's no parlor trick. Without precise calculations we could fly right through a supernova, or bounce into a singularity. I've seen it happen, too; I only wish I hadn't.", "What kept you?", "Right here, Jabba.", "I've been waiting for you.", "You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?", "Look, Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me, come see me yourself. Don't send one of these twerps.", "Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.", "Did you think I had a choice? But I got a nice easy charter now; I'll pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need a little more time.", "Fifteen, Jabba, and don't push it.", "Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.", "Who's scruffy-looking?", "I know.", "Never tell me the odds.", "Then I'll see you in Hell!", "Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.", "Sure, Leia.", "I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.", "Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.", "Stop what?", "My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?", "You're trembling.", "You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.", "I'm nice men.", "Shh.", "Don't get excited.", "Sorry sweetheart. I haven't got time for anything else.", "Well Princess, it looks like you managed to keep me here a while longer.", "That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.", "Laugh it up, fuzzball.", "Thank you. Thank you very much.", "They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?", "You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake, well, this could be it, sweetheart.", "Afraid I was gonna leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?", "I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss.", "Oh, yeah? Watch this.", "I think we're in trouble.", "We're in trouble!", "Loud and clear, kid. What's up?", "There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. Sensors are placed. I'm going back.", "This is no cave.", "We need?", "Well, what about YOU need?", "You probably don't.", "Come on you want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.", "No! That's not it. Come on.", "A-ha! Come on!", "Am I? Then why are you following me afraid I was gonna leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?", "I could arrange that!", "You could use a good kiss!", "Yeah, me too.", "Why not?", "I'm sorry too.", "I'm not going to argue with that.", "I know.", "How ya feeling kid? You don't look so bad to me. You look strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark.", "That's two you owe me junior.", "Not entirely stable. I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie! Take the Professor in back and plug him into the hyperdrive!", "No time to discuss this as a committee.", "What's going on... Buddy?", "I'm not really interested in your opinion 3PO.", "Well, that was a long time ago, I'm sure he's forgotten about that.", "It's not my fault.", "Ah, repairs. I was hoping you could help me out.", "YOUR ship? Hey, remember you lost her to me, fair and square.", "Deck officer! Deck officer!", "No, no problem. Why?", "Horizontal boosters. Alluvial dampers? Ow! That's not it, bring me the Hydrospanner. I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.", "OW! Chewie!", "No, no problem. Why?", "It might!", "Get out of here, Lando.", "Over to you?", "Luke?", "Perfect. You fixed us all real good, didn't you? My friend?", "Yeah... You're a real hero.", "No! Stop, Chewie, stop! Stop, Chewie!", "Chewie! Listen to me! Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me! Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The Princess. You have to take care of her. You hear me? Huh?", "I know.", "Get out of here, Lando.", "Over to you?", "Luke?", "Perfect. You fixed us all real good, didn't you? My friend!", "Yeah. You're a real hero.", "Chewie? Chewie, is that you?", "Ch-Chewie! I can't see, pal. What's going on?", "Luke? Luke's crazy! He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.", "A Jedi Knight? Jeez, I'm out of it for a little while, everyone gets delusions of grandeur!", "Together again, huh?", "How we doin'?", "That bad, huh?", "Who are you?", "I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.", "You love him,", "don't you?", "All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.", "I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.", "You're going to die here, you know. Convenient.", "Good, I hate long waits.", "Doesn't sound so bad.", "On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?", "Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?", "Proper?", "Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance, though, Chewie, but don't *look* like you're trying to keeping your distance.", "*I* don't know. Fly casual.", "Boba Fett? Boba Fett? Where?", "I love you.", "It's alright, I can see a lot better! Don't move!", "Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?", "I have a really bad feeling about this.", "You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.", "Chewie and I'll take care of this, you stay here.", "Hey, it's me.", "3PO. You tell that slimy piece of worm-ridden filth, he'll get no such pleasure from us.", "Right?", "Good. How far is it? Ask him.", "We need some fresh supplies too.", "Try and get our weapons back.", "Hurry up, will ya? Haven't got all day!", "Well, look at you! A General, huh?", "Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were looking for somebody to lead this crazy attack.", "Well, who says they didn't? Only I ain't crazy.", "Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for coming after me. I owe you one.", "Then we'll do it real quiet-like.", "Just what I always wanted.", "Wait, I know that laugh...", "It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.", "Somehow I got the feeling that didn't work very much.", "I don't know. All I see is blowing sand!", "I guess I'm getting better then.", "Why don't you leave that crate and come with us? We're faster.", "Hey kid!", "Thanks for coming after me.", "I'm thinking... I owe you one.", "What was your job when you were based here?", "Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields?", "People are counting on us. The galaxy is counting on us.", "That's not how the Force works!", "Twelve!", "Fourteen.", "Is there a garbage chute... or trash compactor?", "He was training a new generation of Jedi. There was nobody else left to do it, so he took the burden on himself. Everything was going great, until... one boy, an apprentice, turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible. He just walked away from everything.", "There were a lot of rumors. Stories. People who knew him best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple.", "I used to wonder about that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo jumbo. A magical power holding together good and evil, the dark side and the light. Crazy thing is... it's true. The Force, the Jedi. All of it. It's all true.", "I wouldn't be nice to you. Doesn't pay much.", "I'm thinking about it.", "Did you just call me Solo?", "Listen, Big Deal. You got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Always.", "Okay. How do we blow it up? There's always a way to do that.", "I've got a bad feeling about this.", "That's why I did it. So you'd miss me.", "Oh, really? You're cold?", "Hey, Maz.", "Chewie's working on the Falcon.", "Who had it? Ducain?", "Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him that Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good.", "I used to be.", "You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me!", "Same thing I always do. Talk my way out of it.", "Yes, I do. Every time.", "Escape now, hug later.", "You changed your hair.", "No, new jacket.", "And \"that thing\" can understand you, too, so watch it.", "Hey, can I try that?", "I like this thing.", "Leia.", "Do what?", "I'm trying to be helpful.", "You might need this.", "I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. You know how to use one of those?", "Little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn.", "Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line.", "My help?", "Yeah. I knew him. I knew Luke.", "Where'd you get this ship?", "Jakku? That junkyard?", "Watch the thrust. We're going out of here at lightspeed.", "I never ask that question 'till after I've done it.", "This is *not* how I thought this day was going to go.", "Is there a garbage chute? Trash compactor?", "You think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata's our best bet.", "Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare.", "Any of it.", "If I told you, you wouldn't like it.", "Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... Every time you look at me you're reminded of him.", "There's nothing more we could have done. There's too much Vader in him.", "We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever any good at.", "We lost our son. Forever.", "If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?", "I never made a deal with Kanjuklub!", "Tasu Leech. Good to see you.", "Boys, you're both gonna get what I promised. Have I ever not delivered for you before?", "What was the second time?", "Oh, don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.", "I'm hauling Rathtars. Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang. Must have tracked us from Nantoon.", "They're big and they're dangerous.", "Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through.", "I hate that guy.", "Finn, be careful with those. They're explosives.", "Where did you get that?", "I don't know; but, it ain't good.", "I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here.", "We disable the shields. Can you work there? What have you got?", "I like this guy.", "We'll get you there.", "If I told you, you wouldn't like it.", "If I get any higher, they'll see us!", "The girl knows her stuff!", "Ben!", "Take off that mask. You don't need it.", "The face of my son.", "That's what Snoke wants you to believe, but it's not true. My son is alive.", "Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you. You know it's true.", "No, it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you.", "Yes. Anything."], "Jango_Fett": ["I'm just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe.", "Once or twice.", "Possibly.", "Do you like your army?", "They'll do their job well. I'll guarantee that.", "We'll have to try something more subtle this time, Zam. My client is getting impatient. Take these...", "Be careful. They're very poisonous.", "Zam, there can be no mistakes this time!", "Well, we won't be seeing him again.", "We must stop them before they're ready.", "Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi."]}
