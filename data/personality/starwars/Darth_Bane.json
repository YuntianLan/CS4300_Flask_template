He developed this philosophy after his personal experiences and by studying ancient Sith documents.[6] Having witnessed the destruction of the Sith, Bane believed that their infighting and greed led to their downfall. In order to preserve the Sith as its last survivor, Bane adopted the Rule of Two,[4] believing that limiting the number of Sith to one Master and one apprentice would allow the Sith to survive in secret so they could plot their revenge against the Jedi.[3] Like his descendants, Bane was known for inspiring fear in the hearts of other beings.[12]\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
