{"id": "Daredevil", "name": "Daredevil", "fandom": "marvelcinematicuniverse", "url": "https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Daredevil", "personality": ["Matt Murdock, for lack of a better term, is complicated. As a child, he felt immense guilt and loss: blaming himself for the death of his father as well as feeling lost after losing his sight. He was both heroic and selfless even as a child, as was shown best when he saved an elderly man from being hit by a truck, at the cost of his own vision. Murdock has \"daddy issues\" with both his actual father Jack Murdock and his subsequent father figure Stick, having lost both either to death or from being abandoned. Stick tried to raise him to be coldblooded but suddenly abandoned him when Matt started expressing filial affection; this abandonment and rejection has left Murdock with difficulty forging real emotional connections, despite his determination to not let Stick define him. Though it is evident that by the time of meeting the rest of the Defenders that he was starting to open up and accept help from others. This was also proven when he asked Danny to protect his city before his apparent death.\n", "Murdock has a high desire for justice and doing the right thing. He convinced his friend Foggy Nelson to quit their internship at Landman and Zack to start their own firm which would work for the common man. During the start of their firm, he aimed to help only innocent people. Unable to allow injustice, he got frustrated when the police or judicial system failed to help. He decided to work as a vigilante to save people and help where the justice system could not. During this, he demonstrated extreme selflessness as he kept risking his life for others, even after he barely made it out of dangerous situations and ended up badly wounded multiple times.\n", "While fighting crime, he can be very brutal and heavily injures criminals in such manner as breaking their bones. He has hospitalized multiple criminals in this regard, with the first man he beat up having to eat through a straw for a month. However, he has avoided intentionally killing anyone so far and limits himself to hand to hand combat and sticks so as to not inflict lethal injuries, even if this results in himself getting injured during fights. When the Steel Serpent warehouse started burning, he used a gun to try and scare everyone into leaving and ordered a downed guard to evacuate them, showing great concern for even his enemies, as both the guards and the workers there had attacked him. He usually attempts to avoid killing people, and has yet to kill anyone so far, as he believes he's on thin ice as it is and that doing so will make him no better than the people he's fighting. His refusal to kill earns him heavy criticism from Frank Castle, who kills criminals without hesitation or remorse and considers Matt a coward who can't finish the job. Matt believes that the people he's up against deserve a second chance, to try again. As he believes that there is goodness in people.\n", "Despite his reluctance to kill, Matt has, on occasion, when sufficiently infuriated or when the situation is dire, thrown away his concern for the well-being of his opponents, such as when he used a kitchen knife when Semyon came for him, tortured him with it and even threw him off of a rooftop, though he knew he would live because of the dumpster positioned under where Semyon fell. The harming or killing of innocent people, such as Elena Cardenas, makes him even more willing to kill, as he told Elena's killer that he would not stop beating him if he did not go to the police.\n", "Later on, his fight with Nobu Yoshioka resulted in the latter's accidental immolation and apparent death, though he was angry when he learned that Wilson Fisk actually wanted Nobu to die and did not lift a finger to save him when he had the chance. When the resurrected Yoshioka ended up killing Elektra, his resulting ferocity made him able to easily beat Yoshioka and knock him off a building with a wire from his Billy Club, seemingly not caring if Nobu came back to life or not. He has also threatened to kill Wilson Fisk, and has acknowledged that he meant it at the time, while he also did slash Fisk with one of Yoshioka's discarded blades, only to find that his suit was concealing body armor. So far he has been lucky that during these lapses in his sense of morality he has failed to follow through on his intent, however even his temporary willingness to kill still feeds his sense of guilt when he reflects on it.\n", "His most complex relationship is arguably is the one with Elektra. When Elektra first reentered his life, Matt was not best pleased to see her, as the two had parted on less than favorable terms. Before long, he began to consider her a nuisance, due to her constantly involving him in her battles with the Hand, when he already had his hands full dealing with the Frank Castle case. At one point, he had to tell her that his life didn't stop every time she called him. Overtime, however, he got more and more involved in her struggle, and his relationships with Karen and Foggy became more distant as a result. Eventually, he came to realize that he actually loves Elektra and that she makes him more alive than anything else. Eventually these feelings would lead Matt to re-enter the collapsing Midland Circle caves in a attempt to rescue her, but ultimately was unable to do so and was nearly killed as a result of being crushed under the rubble.\n", "As a Catholic, Murdock experiences a lot of guilt and soul-searching over his actions when he allows his anger and contempt for violent criminals to cause him to enjoy beating them bloody, and he frequently wonders whether he is doing the right thing in the eyes of God or whether he is allowing evil into his heart. When he feels this way, he approaches his local priest, Father Paul Lantom, for spiritual guidance and advice, however, he asks his questions in a roundabout way to conceal his identity as Daredevil, though Lantom has managed to figure out the truth. Either way, Lantom is bound by the seal of confession not to divulge what they discuss. After Murdock met his mentor Stick again, he started to doubt his ways and even considered killing Wilson Fisk as he doubted he could stop him any other way. This created an internal struggle as his best friend and others did not want him to act as a vigilante. In the final confrontation against Fisk, he kept true to his vow and ultimately did not kill Fisk.\n", "His vigilante activities have also been the source of his falling out with Karen, Claire, and Foggy and throughout the series have caused problems between him and the latter. For a time he even retires as Daredevil trying to work as an independent lawyer and receiving outsourced work from Nelson to keep him busy. This was after the Hand's return and the formation of the Defenders, he comes to embrace and defend his life as a crime-fighting vigilante; evident when Page commented that he was just getting his life back to which he replied, \"This is my life, Karen.\"\n", "After Midland Circle had collapsed on him and Elektra's disappearance, Murdock starts to forsake the religion he had followed for so long by outwardly expressing that he was no longer fighting for God but rather for himself or that he now understands where him and God stand.While he did berate God directly, he still does prayers and asked for forgiveness although sparingly.  Murdock showed spiteful attitude to the nun who had tended to him who believed that Murdock had simply lost his faith. He had shoved away all his friends, loved ones, and his own career by not telling anyone of his whereabouts or that he was still alive for a while. These actions have resulted in him embracing his vigilante persona more than ever. Murdock's reluctance to become a lawyer again shows his disbelief in the court system being fair; that sometimes people can get away from their crimes if they are that powerful. It enhances his rationale that killing off Fisk is the best way to beat because he believes he would just escape prison if he got turned in. But all that in mind, it showed Murdock had been left mentally broken. \n", "Due to the events of Benjamin Poindexter's assault on innocent people and FIsk's domination over the FBI, Murdock realized he needed to be able to trust and rely on others again, especially his friends. He was willing to bring in Fisk through the law suggested by Nelson. It did seem that he was going back to his original self but the death of Ray Nadeem reimbursed his cold tactic to kill Fisk off for the good of the city. But at that when he had the chance to do so, he hesitated and ultimately refused, saying to Fisk that he won't let him destroy who he is. The death of Father Lantom also helped him get back into his religious faith and empowered Murdock to be more like him; to be a man without fear.  \n"], "personality_quotes": [["\"Matt's Matt because he believes that everyone deserves a shot at redemption.\"\"Except Fisk.\"\"Everyone.

After his father was killed by mobsters, Murdock was trained by Stick to become a warrior, using his disability as an advantage to fight for the Chaste. However Murdock's compassion with Elektra led him to be rejected by Stick, as he then returned to Columbia University with Foggy Nelson to gain his law degree and dedicated his life to fight injustice where he could find it in New York City as a lawyer by day with his law firm Nelson and Murdock, and by night as a vigilante known as Daredevil. Murdock's actions as a crime fighter had eventually put him into conflict with a crime lord named Wilson Fisk. Murdock used his skills to expose Fisk's criminal activities and then have him taken to prison.\n"}
