{"id": "Heimdall", "name": "Heimdall", "fandom": "marvelcinematicuniverse", "url": "https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Heimdall", "personality": ["Heimdall is a strong and loyal warrior, with a high sense of honor. Although being extremely powerful, even for an Asgardian, he loyally serves Odin, having swore an oath of faith to his king. However his true loyalty lies with the throne of Asgard, rather than Odin personally, as such when during Loki's reign, he did not personally let Sif and the Warriors Three pass onto Earth, but he secretly gave them his blessing. Then after Loki found out, he announced Heimdall as a traitor and no longer a citizen of Asgard. As a result, Heimdall attacked Loki, no longer bound to serve him. He was loyal enough to confess his disobedience (although he called it treachery) to Odin and surrendered.\n"], "quotes": [["\"Complicated fellow, isn't he?\"", "―Fandral[src]"]], "figure_captions": []}
