She is very good with people, as she won over Jemma Simmons after revealing her true allegiance to S.H.I.E.L.D. (though Simmons was just only planning to help Fitz smuggle the toolbox out), and is good friends with Alphonso Mackenzie and was able to befriend the members of Phil Coulson's S.H.I.E.L.D. faction, despite the fact her ex-husband Lance Hunter had been telling everyone that she was a 'Demonic Hell-Beast'.\n", "While she is exceptionally good at deception, Bobbi does not like lying to those close to her, especially when her true allegiance came to light. After Robert Gonzales' S.H.I.E.L.D. faction had taken over the Playground, Morse's loyalty was torn, as she wanted to stay loyal to Gonzales but she had also made friends in Coulson's faction and was upset by their reaction to her true loyalty. Bobbi also has strong morals and is unprejudiced as she refused to harm Skye and tried to stop Tomas Calderon from shooting her and later defended her from Robert Gonzales when he called her 'it'. Bobbi yet again showed her unprejudiced beliefs when she stated that the Inhumans shouldn't be considered enemies since they did not know anything about them.\n", "Bobbi has been shown to be exceptionally strong-willed and stubborn, as she refused to break even when tortured by Grant Ward and Kara Palamas for her actions and she said that nothing will make her change her mind, something that was noticed by the former, who went on to praise Bobbi for it.\n"], "quotes": [["\"She's amazing.\"\"That's why I asked her to join the team.\"", "―Jemma Simmons and Phil Coulson[src]"]], "figure_captions": []}
