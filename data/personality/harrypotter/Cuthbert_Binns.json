However, it can be seen that he was very impatient and did not take the liberty of learning his students' names, calling Hermione Granger \"Miss Grant\", Parvati Patil \"Miss Pennyfeather\", Seamus Finnigan \"O'Flaherty\" and even the famous Harry Potter \"Perkins\". It's possible he was actually calling them by the names of previous students from years ago, possibly due to senility as he was very old at the time of death. Binns was also shown to be a firm disbeliever in legends and mythology, dedicating his studies and lectures on \"solid, believable fact\". He is said to have a drawling monotonous voice, which most of his students had become bored with.\n"], "personality_quotes": [], "figure_captions": [], "quote": ["My subject is History of Magic.

He owned an office in the main castle and Classroom 4F on the first floor to teach in. He taught until a very old age, when he fell asleep in the staff room and died in slumber. Now, he is a ghost who continued to teach, droning on about various Goblin Rebellions and Giant Wars to bored, sleeping students.\n"}
