They also shared a great interest in Divination and are relatively close to Professor Trelawney.[8]\n", "Both girls could also be insensitive to others at times, a Gryffindor trait according to Ravenclaw prefect Robert Hilliard (albeit a stereotypically negative one). This was exemplified when they pointed and laughed at Luna Lovegood's radish earrings.[12] Still, Parvati was loyal to those she considered her friends. She stood up to those who treated her friends poorly, such as when she defended Neville Longbottom against Draco Malfoy's taunts[9], and comforted Professor Trelawney after Dolores Umbridge fired her.[12] Parvati was also very brave, as her Sorting into Gryffindor house and her participation in the Battle of Hogwarts proved her courage and determination.[14]\n"], "quotes": [["Boy: \"May I have your arm?\"\n", "Parvati: \"Arm, leg, I'm yours.\""]], "figure_captions": []}
