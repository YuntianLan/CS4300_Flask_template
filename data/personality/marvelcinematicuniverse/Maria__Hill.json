Her clear-headed pragmatism and reason was valued on multiple important occasions, especially during the critical situation surrounding the Avengers Initiative.\n", "She was shown to be extremely loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D. and especially to Director Nick Fury, having personally helped him several times, such as when he faked his death after being attacked by the Winter Soldier. However, Hill ultimately proved that for the greater good, she was willing to discard her loyalties to S.H.I.E.L.D. and help Captain America to destroy HYDRA, despite the fact that it would tear S.H.I.E.L.D. apart.\n", "Since working for Stark Industries, Hill has grown close to her employer Pepper Potts and the Avengers. Though very professional when on the job, she jokes with her colleagues and is lighthearted during times of levity. However, she still remained professional and never let her guard down, not completely trusting Tony Stark, nor did he trust her.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
