She was kind and nurturing to the students, and surely encouraged Neville Longbottom's penchant for Herbology because he was anxious to show her his Mimbulus Mimbletonia.[59]\n", "She also seemed horrified when she learnt that Ginny Weasley had been kidnapped by Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk and taken into the Chamber of Secrets, clasping her shaking hand over her mouth in shock. Professor Sprout was also very brave, always ready to fight for her side. During the Battle of Hogwarts, she did not question McGonagall's decision to defend Hogwarts and immediately sought to provide whatever assistance she could, collecting various dangerous plants to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters[60], showing her utmost loyalty and dedication for defending her school and standing up for what is right. \n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
