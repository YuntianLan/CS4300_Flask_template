sw_L6 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ They must be dead by now. Blast, what's left of them.
sw_L7 +++$+++ sw_u3 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ TC14 +++$+++ Oh, excuse me, so sorry.
sw_L8 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ What in blazes is going on down there?
sw_L9 +++$+++ sw_u4 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RUNE +++$+++ Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?
sw_L10 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ Well, not exactly, but I don't... Seal off the bridge.
sw_L11 +++$+++ sw_u4 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RUNE +++$+++ That won't be enough, sir.
sw_L12 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!
sw_L13 +++$+++ sw_u4 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RUNE +++$+++ We will not survive this.

sw_L17 +++$+++ sw_u4 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RUNE +++$+++ Where are those destroyer droids?!
sw_L18 +++$+++ sw_u4 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RUNE +++$+++ We have them on the run, sir...they're no match for destroyer droids.
sw_L19 +++$+++ sw_u5 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ TEY HOW +++$+++ Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.
sw_L20 +++$+++ sw_u5 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ TEY HOW +++$+++ Sir, a transmission from the planet.
sw_L21 +++$+++ sw_u4 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RUNE +++$+++ It's Queen Amidala herself.
sw_L22 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ At last we're getting results.
sw_L23 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++  Again you come before me, Your highness. The Federation is pleased.
sw_L24 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy...Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.
sw_L25 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ I was not aware of such a failure.
sw_L26 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ I have word that the Senate is finally voting on this blockade of yours.
sw_L27 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ I take it you know the outcome. I wonder why they bother to vote.
sw_L28 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ Enough of this pretense, Viceroy! I'm aware the Chancellor's Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have beencommanded to reach a settlement.
sw_L29 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ I know nothing about any Ambassadors...you must be mistaken.
sw_L30 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ Beware, Viceroy....the Federation is going too far this time.
sw_L31 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ Your Highness, we would never do anything without the approval of the Senate. You assume too much.
sw_L32 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ We will see.
sw_L33 +++$+++ sw_u4 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RUNE +++$+++ She's right, the Senate will never....
sw_L34 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ It's too late now.
sw_L35 +++$+++ sw_u4 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RUNE +++$+++ Do you think she suspects an attack?
sw_L36 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there.
sw_L37 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ ...How could that be true? I have assurances from the Chancellor...his Ambassaodrs did arrive. It must be the...get...negotiate...
sw_L38 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ Senator Palpatine?!?  What's happening?
sw_L39 +++$+++ sw_u8 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BIBBLE +++$+++ A malfunction?
sw_L40 +++$+++ sw_u8 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BIBBLE +++$+++ A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.
sw_L41 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ Don't jump to conclusions, Governor. The Federation would not dare go that far.
sw_L42 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ We must continue to rely on negotiation.
sw_L43 +++$+++ sw_u8 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BIBBLE +++$+++ Negotiation? We've lost all communications!...and where atre the Chancellors Ambassadors? How can we negotiate? We must prepare to defend ourselves.
sw_L44 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.
sw_L45 +++$+++ sw_u4 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RUNE +++$+++ ...and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have gotton onto one of your landing craft.
sw_L46 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ Excellent.

sw_L89 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her.
sw_L90 +++$+++ sw_u11 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ Queen Amidala is yound and naive. You will find controlling her will not be difficult. You have done well, Viceroy.

sw_L110 +++$+++ sw_u8 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BIBBLE +++$+++ ...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?
sw_L111 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ The Naboo and the Federation will forge a treaty that will legitimize our occupation here. I've been assured it will be ratified by the Senate.
sw_L112 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ I will not co-operate.
sw_L113 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ Now, now, your Highness. You are not going to like what we have in store for your people. In time, their suffering will persuade you to see our point of view. Commander.  Process them.

sw_L115 +++$+++ sw_u8 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BIBBLE +++$+++ Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador.

sw_L117 +++$+++ sw_u8 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BIBBLE +++$+++ They wouldn't dare.
sw_L118 +++$+++ sw_u8 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BIBBLE +++$+++ Please, Your Highness, reconsider. Our only hope is for the Senate to side with us... Senator Palpatine will need your help.
sw_L119 +++$+++ sw_u8 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BIBBLE +++$+++ Your Highness, I will stay here and do what I can...They will have to retain the Council of Governors in order to maintain control. But you must leave...
sw_L120 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ Either choice presents a great risk...to all of us...
sw_L121 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ We are brave, Your Highness.
sw_L122 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ Then, I will plead our case before the Senate.  Be careful, Governor.
sw_L123 +++$+++ sw_u14 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ GUARD DROID +++$+++ Where are you going?
sw_L124 +++$+++ sw_u15 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DROID GUARD +++$+++ You're under arrest!

sw_L130 +++$+++ sw_u16 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RIC OLIE +++$+++ There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant...the hyperdrive is leaking.
sw_L131 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ We control all the cities in the North and are searching for any other settlements...
sw_L132 +++$+++ sw_u11 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ Destroy all high-ranking officials, Viceroy...slowly...quietly. And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?
sw_L133 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ She has disappeared, My Lord. One Naboo cruiser got pat the blockade.
sw_L134 +++$+++ sw_u11 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ Viceroy, find her! I want that treaty signed.
sw_L135 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ My Lord, it's impossible to locate the ship. It's out of our range.
sw_L136 +++$+++ sw_u11 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ ...not for a Sith...
sw_L137 +++$+++ sw_u11 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++  ...Viceroy, this is my apprentice. Lord Maul. He will find your lost ship.
sw_L138 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ Yes, My Lord. The hologram fades off.
sw_L139 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++  This is getting out of hand...now there are two of them.
sw_L140 +++$+++ sw_u4 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RUNE +++$+++ We should not have made this bargain. What will happen when the Jedi become aware of these Sith Lords?
sw_L141 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ It is to be commended...what is its number?
sw_L142 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ Thank you, Artoo Detoo. You have proven to be very loyal...Padme!
sw_L143 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++  Clean this droid up the best you can. It deserves our gratitude... Continue, Captain.
sw_L144 +++$+++ sw_u17 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ CAPTAIN PANAKA +++$+++ Your Highness, Tatooine is very dangerous. It's controlled by an alliance of gangs called the Hutts. I do not agree with the Jedi on this.

sw_L163 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They live on the Moons of Iego I thimk. They are the most beautiful creatures in the universe. They are good and kind, and so pretty they make even the most hardened spice pirate cry.
sw_L164 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You must be one...maybe you just don't know it.
sw_L165 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much?
sw_L166 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold to Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on the Podraces, to Watto, who's a lot better master than Gardulla, I think.
sw_L167 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You're...a slave?
sw_L168 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I am a person! My name is Anakin.

sw_L173 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no good out here. I need something more real...
sw_L174 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ No they won'ta. QUI-GON, using his mind power, waves his hand again.
sw_L175 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ No, they won'ta. What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only money. No money, no parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive, I promise you that.
sw_L176 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ ...wouldn't have lasted long if I weren't so good at fixing things. I'm making my own droid...
sw_L177 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I'm glad I met you,....ah...
sw_L178 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ ...Anakin.
sw_L179 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin.
sw_L180 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Anakin Skywalker.
sw_L181 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Padme Naberrie.
sw_L182 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm glad I met you too.
sw_L183 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++  Ootmians! Tinka me chasa hopoe ma booty na nolia.
sw_L184 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  La lova num botaffa. (They seemed nice to me.) WATTO :  Fweepa niaga. Tolpa da bunky dunko. (Clean the racks, then you can go home.) ANAKIN lets out a "yipee" and runs out the back.
sw_L185 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Noah gain...da beings hereabouts cawazy. Wesa be robbed un crunched.
sw_L186 +++$+++ sw_u20 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ VENDOR +++$+++ Hey, that will be seven truguts!!
sw_L187 +++$+++ sw_u21 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SEBULBA +++$+++  Chuba!! (You!!) JAR JAR : Who, mesa?? SEBULBA :  Ni chuba na?? (Is this yours??) SEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly. SEVERAL OTHER CREATURES start to gather. SEBULBA shoves JAR JAR to the ground. The Gungan desperately tries to scramble to safety.
sw_L188 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++  Why mesa always da one??
sw_L189 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Because you're afraid.
sw_L190 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Chess ko, Sebulba...Coo wolpa tooney rana. (Careful, Sebulba...This one's very connected.) SEBULBA stops his assault on JAR JAR and turns to ANAKIN.
sw_L191 +++$+++ sw_u21 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SEBULBA +++$+++  Tooney rana nu pratta dunko, shag. (Connected?? Whada you mean, slave?) ANAKIN :  Oh da Hutt...cha porko ootman geesa...me teesa rodda co pana pee choppa chawa. co pana pee choppa chawa. (As in Hutt...big time outlander, this one... I'd hate to see you diced before we race again.) SEBULBA :  Neek me chowa, wermo, mo killee ma klounkee(Next time we race, wermo, it will be the end of you!) Una noto wo shag, me wompity du pom pom.  SEBULBA turns away.
sw_L192 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Eh, chee bana do mullee ra. (Yeah, it'd be a pity if you had to pay for me.) QUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive.
sw_L193 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Hi! Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange goo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.
sw_L194 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Nosir, nosir. Mesa hate crunchen. Dat's da last ting mesa wanten.
sw_L195 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Mesa doen nutten!
sw_L196 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by squashing you...be less afraid.
sw_L197 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ And that works for you.
sw_L198 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ To a point.  EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY OBI-WAN stands in front of the Naboo spacecraft as the wind picks up and begins to whip at his robe. CAPTAIN PANAKA exits the ship and joins him.
sw_L199 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ How are you feeling today, Jira?
sw_L200 +++$+++ sw_u22 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JIRA +++$+++ The heat's never been kind to me, you know, Annie!
sw_L201 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Guess what? I've found that cooling unit I've been searching for.
sw_L202 +++$+++ sw_u22 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JIRA +++$+++ You're a fine boy, Annie.
sw_L203 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'll take four pallies today.  You'll like these...
sw_L204 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Whoops, I thought I had more...Make thgat three, I'm not hungry.
sw_L205 +++$+++ sw_u22 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JIRA +++$+++ Gracious, my bones are aching...storm's coming on, Annie. You'd better get home quick.
sw_L206 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Do you have shelter?
sw_L207 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Is it far?
sw_L208 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ On the outskirts.
sw_L209 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You'll never reach the outskirts in time...sandstorms are very, very dangerous. Come with me. Hurry!
sw_L210 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Mom! Mom! I'm home.
sw_L211 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Dissen cozy.
sw_L212 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Oh, my!! Annie, what's this?
sw_L213 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ These are my friends, Mom. This is Padme, and...gee, I don't know any of your names.
sw_L214 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ ...and our droid, Artoo-Detoo.
sw_L215 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm building a droid. You wanna see?
sw_L216 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Anakin! Why are they here?
sw_L217 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ A sandstorm, Mom. Listen.
sw_L218 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Come on! Let me show you Threepio!
sw_L219 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Oh, tank you. Thank you so much. I'm sorry if I was abrupt. I'll never get used to Anakin's surprises.
sw_L220 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Yes, I know.
sw_L221 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Isn't he great?! He's not finished yet.
sw_L222 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ He's wonderful!
sw_L223 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You reall like him? He's a protocol droid...to help Mom. Watch!
sw_L224 +++$+++ sw_u24 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How might I serve you?
sw_L225 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ He's perfect.
sw_L226 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ When the storm is over, you can see my racer. I'm building a Podracer!
sw_L227 +++$+++ sw_u24 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ I beg your pardon....what do you mean I'm naked?
sw_L228 +++$+++ sw_u24 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++  My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness. How embarrassing!
sw_L229 +++$+++ sw_u8 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BIBBLE +++$+++ ...cut off all food supplies until you return...the death toll is catastrophic...we must bow to their wishes, Your Highness...Please tell us what to do! If you can hear us, Your Highness, you must contact me...
sw_L230 +++$+++ sw_u25 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH MAUL +++$+++ Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I will find them quickly, Master.
sw_L231 +++$+++ sw_u11 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will sign the treaty.
sw_L232 +++$+++ sw_u25 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH MAUL +++$+++ At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge.
sw_L233 +++$+++ sw_u11 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will be no match for you. It is too late for them to stop us now. Everything is going as planned. The Republic will soon be in my command.
sw_L234 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.
sw_L235 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no luck.
sw_L236 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Any attempt to escape...
sw_L237 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ ...and they blow you up...poof!
sw_L238 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ How wude.
sw_L239 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The Republic's anti-slavery laws...
sw_L240 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.
sw_L241 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Have you ever seen a Podrace?
sw_L242 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm the only human who can do it.
sw_L243 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's never heard of a human doing it.
sw_L244 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I...I was wondering...something...
sw_L245 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?
sw_L246 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.
sw_L247 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.
sw_L248 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I think you have...why else would you be here?
sw_L249 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?
sw_L250 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it.
sw_L251 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I can help! I can fix anything!
sw_L252 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Wit no-nutten mula to trade.
sw_L253 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.
sw_L254 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races.
sw_L255 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...
sw_L256 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let you...
sw_L257 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Watto doesn't know I've built it.  You could make him think it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.
sw_L258 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ I don't want you to race, Annie...It's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it.
sw_L259 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina pitty bad goo.
sw_L260 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other...
sw_L261 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Anakin, don't...
sw_L262 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will find another way...
sw_L263 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ No, Annie's right, there is no other way... I may not like it, but he can help you...he was meant to help you.
sw_L264 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Is that a yes? That is a yes!
sw_L265 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know.
sw_L266 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Well, I don't approve.
sw_L267 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ Patta go bolla!
sw_L268 +++$+++ sw_u26 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANKAIN +++$+++ No batta!
sw_L269 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ Pedunky. Maa kee cheelya.
sw_L270 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Bayno, Bayno!
sw_L271 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ The boy tells me you wanta sponser hi insa race. You can't afford parts. How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think.  QUI-GON : My ship will be the entry fee.
sw_L272 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ Not bad...not bad...a Nubian.
sw_L273 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last race. It will take some time to fix it.
sw_L274 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Ahhhh....it wasn't my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his vent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly.
sw_L275 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++  That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there.
sw_L276 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++  Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya. (Your friend is a follish one, methinks.) EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - TATOOINE DESERT - DAY OBI-WAN stands outside the Naboo spacecraft, speaking into his comlink.
sw_L277 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ He knows nothing of greed. He has...
sw_L278 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Yes...
sw_L279 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ He deserves better than a slave's life.
sw_L280 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him birth...I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?
sw_L281 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Padme and Jar Jar, this is my friend Kitster, and seek, Amee, and Wald.
sw_L282 +++$+++ sw_u27 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ KITSTER +++$+++ Wow, a real Astro Droid...how'd you get so lucky?
sw_L283 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ This isn't the half of it. I'm entered in the Boonta Race tomorrow!
sw_L284 +++$+++ sw_u27 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ KITSTER +++$+++ What? With this??
sw_L285 +++$+++ sw_u28 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WALD +++$+++  Annie, Jesko na joka. 9You are such a joke, Annie.) AMEE : You've been working on that thing for years. It's never going to run.
sw_L286 +++$+++ sw_u29 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SEEK +++$+++ Come on, let's go play ball. Keep it up, Annie, and you're gonna be bug squash.
sw_L287 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Hey! Jar Jar! Stay away from those energy binders...
sw_L288 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Who, mesa?
sw_L289 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.
sw_L290 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho.  KITSTER : But you don't even know if this thing will run.
sw_L291 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ It will.
sw_L292 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ There are so many! Do they all have a system of planets?
sw_L293 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Has anyone been to them all?
sw_L294 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I want to be the first one to see them all... Ouch!
sw_L295 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++  Annie, bedtime!
sw_L296 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What are you doing?
sw_L297 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I've never seen...
sw_L298 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++  Annie! I'm not goiung to tell you again!
sw_L299 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I hope you're about finished.
sw_L300 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You were in my dream...you were leading a huge army into battle.
sw_L301 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I hope not; I hate fighting. Your mother wants you to come in and clean up. We have to leave soon. ANAKIN stands up and stretches just as KITSTER arrives.
sw_L302 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Hook 'em up, Kitster.  I won't be long. Where's Qui-Gon?
sw_L303 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ He and Jar Jar left already. They're with Watto at the arena.
sw_L304 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ ...I want to see your spaceship the moment the race is over.
sw_L305 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ Not if your ship belongs to me, I think...I warn you, no funny business.
sw_L306 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.
sw_L307 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ He always wins.  I'm betting heavily on Sebulba.
sw_L308 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++  What??!! What do you mean?
sw_L309 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ A Pod for slaves. I don't think so...well, poerhaps. Just one...the mother, maybe...the boy isn't for sale.
sw_L310 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ No Pod's worth two slaves...not by a long shot...one slave or nothing.
sw_L311 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ We'll let fate decide. Blue it's the boy, red his mother...
sw_L312 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++  You won the small toss, outlander, bou you won't win the race, so...it makes little difference.
sw_L313 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++  (subtitled) Bonapa keesa pateeso, o wanna meetee chobodd.
sw_L314 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What did he mean by that?
sw_L315 +++$+++ sw_u24 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous.
sw_L316 +++$+++ sw_u24 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships!
sw_L317 +++$+++ sw_u27 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ KITSTER +++$+++  This is so wizard! I'm sure you'll do it this time, Annie.
sw_L318 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Do what?
sw_L319 +++$+++ sw_u27 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ KITSTER +++$+++ Finish the race, of course!
sw_L320 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You've never won a race?
sw_L321 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Well...not exactly...
sw_L322 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Not even finished?!
sw_L323 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ ...but Kitster's right, I will this time.

I see the contestants are making their way out onto the starting grid.

sw_L334 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Dis berry loony, Annie. May da guds be kind, mesa palo.
sw_L335 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You carry all our hopes.
sw_L336 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I won't let you down.
sw_L337 +++$+++ sw_u21 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SEBULBA +++$+++ Bazda wahota, shag. Dobiella Nok. Yoka to Bantha poodoo. 9You won't walk away from this one, slave scum! You're Bantha poodoo.) ANAKIN :  Cha skrundee da pat, sleemo. (Don't count on it, slime-ball.) ANAKIN looks the evil SEBULBA in the eye with a cold stare. QUI-GON approaches, and SEBULBA backs off toward his racer.
sw_L338 +++$+++ sw_u32 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JABBA +++$+++ ...Ka bazza kundee hodrudda! (...Let the challenge begin!) The CROWD lets out a LOUD CHEER. QUI-GON helps ANAKIN into his Pod. The boy straps himself into the tiny racer.
sw_L339 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Mesa no watch. Dissen ganna be messy!
sw_L340 +++$+++ sw_u30 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FODE/BEED +++$+++ - A : Ya pawa culka doe rundee!  B : Hey, it looks like they're clearing the grid.
sw_L341 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Is he nervous?
sw_L342 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You Jedi are far too reckless. The Queen...
sw_L343 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You assume too much.
sw_L344 +++$+++ sw_u30 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FODE/BEED +++$+++ - B : Start your engines.
sw_L345 +++$+++ sw_u30 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FODE/BEED +++$+++ -  A : An dare ovv!  B : Oh...wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.
sw_L346 +++$+++ sw_u30 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FODE/BEED +++$+++ -  B : And there goes Skywalker... He'll be hard pressed to catch up with the leaders today.
sw_L347 +++$+++ sw_u30 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FODE/BEED +++$+++ - B : Looks like a few Tusken Riaders have campe out on the canyon dune turn.
sw_L348 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Where's Skywalker?
sw_L349 +++$+++ sw_u30 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FODE/BEED +++$+++ -  B ; There goes Quadinaros' power couplings.
sw_L350 +++$+++ sw_u31 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ A +++$+++ Sebulba! Ka pa me cheespa wata!  QUI-GON, PADME, SHMI, and JAR JAR yell for joy as ANAKIN passes. JAR JAR is very nervous and pounds on the back of his alien neighbor, FANTA. JAR JAR : What gooie-on?
sw_L351 +++$+++ sw_u33 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FANTA +++$+++ Bug off.
sw_L352 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ He musta crash-ud.
sw_L353 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Here he comes!
sw_L354 +++$+++ sw_u24 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ He has to complete two more circuits? Oh dear!
sw_L355 +++$+++ sw_u30 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FODE/BEED +++$+++ -  B : It looks like Skywalker is moving up through the field. He's in...
sw_L356 +++$+++ sw_u31 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ A +++$+++ Steeth pa nagoola!  ANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and PADME is unbearable.
sw_L357 +++$+++ sw_u30 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FODE/BEED +++$+++ -  A : Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda dunko! A : Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda dunko! (Ody Mandrell into the pits for some attention.) ODY : Droids!
sw_L358 +++$+++ sw_u30 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FODE/BEED +++$+++ -  B :At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely followed by Skywalker...
sw_L359 +++$+++ sw_u30 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FODE/BEED +++$+++ -  B : Skywalker is forced onto the service ramp!
sw_L360 +++$+++ sw_u31 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ A +++$+++ Oh noah!
sw_L361 +++$+++ sw_u34 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FODE BEED +++$+++ -  B : Amazing... a controlled thrust and he's back on course! What a move!
sw_L362 +++$+++ sw_u30 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FODE/BEED +++$+++ -  B : He's catching Sebulba.
sw_L363 +++$+++ sw_u31 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ A +++$+++ Inkabunga.  SEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes into ANAKIN over and over. The young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering rods on the two Pods become hooked together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.
sw_L364 +++$+++ sw_u30 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FODE/BEED +++$+++ -  B : That little human being is out of his mind.
sw_L365 +++$+++ sw_u31 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ A +++$+++ Punda tah punda!  B : They're side by side!
sw_L366 +++$+++ sw_u31 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ A +++$+++ Bongo du bongu!  As they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the steering rods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the steering rod is tremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN's steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts spinning.
sw_L367 +++$+++ sw_u30 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FODE/BEED +++$+++ - B : It's Skywalker! The crowd are going nuts! Oh Ah Oh Ah B : It's Skywalker! The crowd are going nuts! Oh Ah Oh Ah (rock head in tandem with partner) EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - DAY As ANAKIN stops the Podracer, KISTER turns up, and they embrace. Hundreds of SPECTATORS join them and put ANAKIN on their shoulders, marching off, CHEERING AND CHANTING. Darth Maul's PROBE DROIDS move through the crowd.
sw_L368 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ You! You swindled me! You knew the boy was going to win! Somehow you knew it! I lost everything.
sw_L369 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ You can't have him! It wasn't a fair bet!
sw_L370 +++$+++ sw_u18 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ No, no! I want no more of your tricks! Take him!
sw_L371 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Ah, gee...enough of this...
sw_L372 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ It's so wonderful, Annie. You have brought hope to those who have none. I'm so very proud of you...
sw_L373 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ We owe you everything.
sw_L374 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Just feeling this good was worth it.
sw_L375 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ He said I cheated.
sw_L376 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ No!
sw_L377 +++$+++ sw_u35 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ GREEDO +++$+++ Yes.
sw_L378 +++$+++ sw_u28 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ WALD +++$+++ Keep this up, Greedo, and you're gonna come to a bad end.
sw_L379 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Yes!
sw_L380 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money we have!
sw_L381 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Oh, my goodness, That's wonderful.
sw_L382 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What?!?
sw_L383 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Did you hear that, Mom?  Was that part of the prize, or what?
sw_L384 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You're free! SHMI : Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You're free! (turns to Qui-Gon) Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?
sw_L385 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I get to go with you in your starship and everything?!
sw_L386 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ But it's what I want. What I've always dreamed about. Can I go, Mom?!
sw_L387 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I want to go.
sw_L388 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yipee!!
sw_L389 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  What about Mom? Is she free too? You're coming, aren't you, Mom QUI-GON : I tried to free your mother, Annie, but Watto wouldn't have it.
sw_L390 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ But the money from selling...
sw_L391 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let go...to let go of me. I cannot go with you.
sw_L392 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I want to stay with you. I don't want things to change.
sw_L393 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ You can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from setting. Listen to your feelings; Annie, you know what's right.
sw_L394 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm going to miss you so much, Mom...
sw_L395 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ I love you, Annie...now hurry.
sw_L396 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++  Thank you.
sw_L397 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ He was in my life for such a short time.
sw_L398 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Well, Threepio, I'm free...and I'm going away...in a starship...
sw_L399 +++$+++ sw_u24 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Master, Annie, you are my maker, and I wish you well. Although I'd like it better if I were a little less naked.
sw_L400 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, Threepio...give you coverings and all... I'm going to miss working on you. You've been a great pal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything. Bye.
sw_L401 +++$+++ sw_u24 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Sell me?!?
sw_L402 +++$+++ sw_u27 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ KITSTER +++$+++ There are so many of us who want you to stay, Annie... You're a hero.
sw_L403 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I...  I... have to go.
sw_L404 +++$+++ sw_u27 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ KITSTER +++$+++ Well.
sw_L405 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Well.
sw_L406 +++$+++ sw_u27 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ KITSTER +++$+++ Thank's for every moment you've been here. You're my best friend.
sw_L407 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I won't forget.
sw_L408 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I can't do it, Mom. I just can't.
sw_L409 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Annie, remember when you climbed the great dune in order to chase the Banthas away so they wouldn't be shot... Remember how you collapses several times, exhausted thinking you couldn't do it?
sw_L410 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++  This is one of those times when you have to do something you don't think you can do. I know how strong you are, Annie. I know you can do this...
sw_L411 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Will I ever see you again?
sw_L412 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ What does your heart tell you?
sw_L413 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I hope so...yes...I guess.
sw_L414 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Then we will see each other again.
sw_L415 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I.. will become a Jedi and I will come back and free you, Mom...I promise.
sw_L416 +++$+++ sw_u23 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ No matter where you are, my love will be with you. Now be brave, and don't look back... don't look back.
sw_L417 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I love you so much.
sw_L418 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I've been freed, and I'm going away. Buy yourself a cooling unit with this... Otherwise I'll worry about you.
sw_L419 +++$+++ sw_u22 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JIRA +++$+++ Can I give you a hug ANAKIN : Sure.
sw_L420 +++$+++ sw_u22 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JIRA +++$+++ I'll miss you, Annie.. there isn't a kinder boy in the galaxy. You be careful...
sw_L421 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What is it?
sw_L422 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Master Qui-Gon,sir, wait!
sw_L423 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Qui-Gon's in trouble. He says to take off...now!!
sw_L424 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ He's a friend.
sw_L425 +++$+++ sw_u36 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ I don't see anything.
sw_L426 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Are you all right?
sw_L427 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Do you think he'll follow us?
sw_L428 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What are we going to do about it?
sw_L429 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Pleased to meet you. Wow! You're a Jedi too?
sw_L430 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ When are you going to give up this pointless strike? Your Queen is lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going to die, much sooner than your people, I'm afraid. Take him away!
sw_L431 +++$+++ sw_u8 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BIBBLE +++$+++ This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people have decided... They will not live under your tyranny.
sw_L432 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Are you all right?
sw_L433 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ It's very cold.
sw_L434 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You're from a warm planet, Annie. Too warm for my taste. Space is cold.
sw_L435 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You seem sad.
sw_L436 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ The Queen is...worried. Her people are suffering...dying. She must convince the Senate to intervene, or...I'm not sure what will happen.
sw_L437 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm...I'm not sure what's going to happen to me. I dunno if I'll ever see you again..  I made this for you. Sou you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet... It will bring you good fortune.
sw_L438 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ It's beautiful, but I don't need this to remember you. Many things will change when we reach the capital, Annie. My caring for you will always remain.
sw_L439 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I care for you too. Only I...miss...
sw_L440 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ ...You miss your mother.
sw_L441 +++$+++ sw_u16 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RIC OLIE +++$+++ Coruscant...the capital of the Republic...the entire planet is one big city.
sw_L442 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Wow! It's so huge!
sw_L443 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
sw_L444 +++$+++ sw_u37 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ VALORUM +++$+++ Welcome, Your Highness. It is an honor to finally meet you in person. I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the currant situation. I've called for a special session of the Senate to hear your position.
sw_L445 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ I am grateful for your concern, Chancellor.
sw_L446 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ There is a question of precedure, but I feel confident we can overcome it...
sw_L447 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Da Queens- a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks.  Pitty hot!
sw_L448 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Dissen all pitty odd to my.
sw_L449 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Don't look at me. I don't know what's going on.
sw_L450 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ ...the Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates who are only looking out for themselves and their home sytems. There is no interest in the common good...no civility, only politics...its disgusting. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is little chance the Senate will act on the invasion.
sw_L451 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.
sw_L452 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real power...he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. A manufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now.
sw_L453 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ What options do we have?
sw_L454 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces the laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.
sw_L455 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ He has been our strongest supporter. Is there any other way?
sw_L456 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the courts...
sw_L457 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ There's no time for that. The courts take even longer to decide things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator...more and more each day. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.
sw_L458 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ To be realistic, Your Highness, I'd say we're going to have to accept Federation control for the time being.
sw_L459 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ There is something I cannot do.
sw_L460 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ A Sith Lord?!?
sw_L461 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are.
sw_L462 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ I do not believe they could have returned without us knowing.
sw_L463 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we must.
sw_L464 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ This attack was with purpose, that is clear, and I agree the Queen is the target.
sw_L465 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her.
sw_L466 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ We will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and discover the identity of your attacker... May the Force be with you.
sw_L467 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ May the Force be with you.
sw_L468 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++  Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
sw_L469 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ A vergence, you say?
sw_L470 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Located around a person?
sw_L471 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ You're referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring balance to the Force...you believe it's this boy??
sw_L472 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ But you do! Rrevealed your opinion is.
sw_L473 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?
sw_L474 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Bring him before us, then.
sw_L475 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Tested he will be.
sw_L476 +++$+++ sw_u40 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ May I help you, son?
sw_L477 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm...I'm looking for the handmaiden, Padme.
sw_L478 +++$+++ sw_u40 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ The boy is here to see Padme.
sw_L479 +++$+++ sw_u41 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RABE +++$+++ Send him in.
sw_L480 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'd like to speak with Padme, if I could.
sw_L481 +++$+++ sw_u41 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RABE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Annie. Padme is not here right now.
sw_L482 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++  Who is it?
sw_L483 +++$+++ sw_u41 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RABE +++$+++ Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your Highness.
sw_L484 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ I've sent Padme on an errand.
sw_L485 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm going to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope.
sw_L486 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I may not see her again...and... I just wanted to say goodbye.
sw_L487 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ We will tell her for you. We're sure her heart goes with you.
sw_L488 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Thank you, Your Highness. I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
sw_L489 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ If the Federation moves to defer the motion...Your Majesty, Ibeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session.
sw_L490 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ I wish I had your confidence in this, Senator.
sw_L491 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ You must force a new election for Supreme Chancellor...I promise you there are many who will support us...it is our best chance...
sw_L492 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ You truely believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our motion to a vote?
sw_L493 +++$+++ sw_u42 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALAPATINE +++$+++ He is distracted...he is afraid. He will be of no help.
sw_L494 +++$+++ sw_u37 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ VALORUM +++$+++ The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of Naboo.
sw_L495 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has occured on our peaceful system of Naboo. We have become caugt in a dispute you're all well aware of, which began right here with the taxation of trade routes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppresion of the Trade Federation.
sw_L496 +++$+++ sw_u43 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ LOTT DOD +++$+++ This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements!
sw_L497 +++$+++ sw_u37 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ VALORUM +++$+++ The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade Federation at this time. Please return to your station.
sw_L498 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, the recently elected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our behalf.
sw_L499 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ Honorable representatives of the Republic, distinguished delegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I come to you under the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by force.
sw_L500 +++$+++ sw_u43 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ LOTT DOD +++$+++ I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a commision be sent to Naboo to assertain the truth.
sw_L501 +++$+++ sw_u37 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ VALORUM +++$+++ Overruled.
sw_L502 +++$+++ sw_u43 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ LOTT DOD +++$+++ Your Honor, you cannot allow us to be condemned without reasonable observation. It's against all the rules of procedure.
sw_L503 +++$+++ sw_u44 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AKS MOE +++$+++ The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commision must be appointed...that is the law.
sw_L504 +++$+++ sw_u37 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ VALORUM +++$+++ The point...
sw_L505 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will dissapear.
sw_L506 +++$+++ sw_u37 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ VALORUM +++$+++ The point is conceded...Section 523A take precedence here. Queen Amidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations?
sw_L507 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++  I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a "vote of no confidence"...in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.
sw_L508 +++$+++ sw_u37 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ VALORUM +++$+++ What?...No!
sw_L509 +++$+++ sw_u45 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MAS AMEDDA +++$+++ Order! We shall have order...
sw_L510 +++$+++ sw_u46 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Alderaan seconds the motion for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.
sw_L511 +++$+++ sw_u47 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MAD AMEDDA +++$+++ The motion has been seconded by Bail Organa of Alderaan.
sw_L512 +++$+++ sw_u46 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ There must be no delays. The motion is on the floor and must be voted upon in this session.
sw_L513 +++$+++ sw_u43 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ LOTT DOD +++$+++ The Trade Federation moves the motion be sent to the procedures committee for study.
sw_L514 +++$+++ sw_u48 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ASSEMBLY +++$+++ Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!
sw_L515 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is with us...Valorum will be voted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...
sw_L516 +++$+++ sw_u45 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MAS AMEDDA +++$+++ Thew Supreme Chancellor requests a recess. Tomorrow we will begin the vote.
sw_L517 +++$+++ sw_u37 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ VALORUM +++$+++ Palpatine, I thought you were my ally...my friend. You have betrayed me! How could you do this?
sw_L518 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ A ship...a cup...a speeder.
sw_L519 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Good, good, young one. How feel you?
sw_L520 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Cold, sir.
sw_L521 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Afraid are you?
sw_L522 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ No, sir.
sw_L523 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Afraid to give up your life?
sw_L524 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't think so.
sw_L525 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ See through you, we can.
sw_L526 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Be mindful of your feelings...
sw_L527 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I miss her.
sw_L528 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Afraid to lose her..I think.
sw_L529 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  What's that got to do with anything?
sw_L530 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.
sw_L531 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I am not afraid!
sw_L532 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I sense much fear in you.
sw_L533 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I am not afraid.
sw_L534 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Then continue, we will.
sw_L535 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Mesa wonder why da guds invent pain?
sw_L536 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ To motivate us, I imagine...
sw_L537 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Yousa tinken yousa people ganna die?
sw_L538 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ I don't know.
sw_L539 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Gungans ganna get pasted too, eh?
sw_L540 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ I hope not.
sw_L541 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Gungans do die'n without a fight.... wesa warriors. Wesa gotta grand army. Dat why you no liken us, metinks.
sw_L542 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. I promise, Your Majesty, if I am elected, I will bring democracy back to the Republic. I will put an end to corruption. The Trade Fedreation will lose its influence over the bureaucrats, and our people will be freed.
sw_L543 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ Who else can be nominated?
sw_L544 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I feel confident...our "situation" will create a strong sympaphy vote for us... I will be Chancellor, I promise you.
sw_L545 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator, there will be nothing left of our cities, our people, our way of life...
sw_L546 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet. The law is in their favor.
sw_L547 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ With the Senate in transition, there is nothing more I can do here...Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I have decided to go back to Naboo. My place is with my people.
sw_L548 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! You would be in danger. They will force you to sign the treaty.
sw_L549 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different from that of our people. Captain!
sw_L550 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ Ready my ship!
sw_L551 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ No place is safe, if the Senate doesn't condemn this invasion. It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions as a democracy. If you win the election, Senator, I know you will do everything possible to stop the Federation. I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the Senate.
sw_L552 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ ...Correct you were, Qui-Gon.
sw_L553 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ His cells contain a high concentration of midi-chlorians.
sw_L554 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ No. He will not be trained.
sw_L555 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ He is too old. There is already too much anger in him.
sw_L556 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth.
sw_L557 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.
sw_L558 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ We forbid it.
sw_L559 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?
sw_L560 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he has...
sw_L561 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Now is not the time for this...the Senate is voting for a new Spreme Chancellor. Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure on the Federation, and could widen the confrontation.
sw_L562 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ And draw out the Queen's attacker.
sw_L563 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover the identity of the dark warrior. That is the clue we need to unravel this mystery of the Sith.
sw_L564 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
sw_L565 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ He is your ward, Qui-Gon...we will not dispute that.
sw_L566 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!
sw_L567 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Protect the Queen, but do not intercede if it comes to war until we have the Senate's approval.
sw_L568 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ May the Force be with you.
sw_L569 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Master Qui-Gon, sir, I do not wish to be a problem.
sw_L570 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Master, sir...I've been wondering...what are midi-chlorians?
sw_L571 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ They live inside of me?
sw_L572 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Symbionts?
sw_L573 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ They do??
sw_L574 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't understand.
sw_L575 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears the Federation means to destroy me.
sw_L576 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Wesa goen home!
sw_L577 +++$+++ sw_u11 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ The Queen is on her way to you. I regret she is of no further use to us. When she gets there, destroy her.
sw_L578 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ Yes, my Lord.
sw_L579 +++$+++ sw_u11 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ Viceroy, is the planet secure?
sw_L580 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ Yes, my Lord, we have taken over the last pockets of primitive life forms. We are in complete control of the planet now.
sw_L581 +++$+++ sw_u11 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ Good. I will see to it that in the Senate, things stay as they are. I am sending Darth Maul to join you. He will deal with the Jedi.
sw_L582 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ Yes, my Lord.
sw_L583 +++$+++ sw_u4 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RUNE +++$+++ A Sith lord here with us?!!
sw_L584 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ ...and that one?
sw_L585 +++$+++ sw_u16 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RIC OLIE +++$+++ The forward stabalizer.
sw_L586 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ And those control the pitch?
sw_L587 +++$+++ sw_u16 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RIC OLIE +++$+++ You catch on pretty quick.
sw_L588 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ I'm going to take back what's ours.
sw_L589 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ Jar Jar Binks!
sw_L590 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Mesa, Your Highness?
sw_L591 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ Yes. I need your help.
sw_L592 +++$+++ sw_u49 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PANAKA +++$+++ The blockade's gone.
sw_L593 +++$+++ sw_u16 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RIC OLIE +++$+++ I have one battleship on my scope.
sw_L594 +++$+++ sw_u49 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PANAKA +++$+++ They've probably spotted us.
sw_L595 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Hi! Where have you been?
sw_L596 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Annie! What are you doing here?
sw_L597 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm with Qui-Gon...but...they're not going to let me be a Jedi.
sw_L598 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ This is going to be dangerous, Annie.
sw_L599 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Is it? I can help... Where are we going?
sw_L600 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ To war, I'm afraid. The Queen has had to make the most difficuld decision of her life. She doesn't believe in fighting, Annie. We are a peaceful people...
sw_L601 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I want to help...I'm glad you're back.
sw_L602 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Ello! Where das everybody?

sw_L611 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ We wish to form an alliance...
sw_L612 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Your Honor...
sw_L613 +++$+++ sw_u10 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BOSS NASS +++$+++ Whosa dis?
sw_L614 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I am Queen Amidala  This is my decoy...my protection...my loyal bodyguard.
sw_L615 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  ...I am sorry for my deception, but under the circumstances it has become necessary to protect myself. Although we do not always agree, Your Honor, our two great societies have always lived in peace...until now. The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have worked so hard to build. You are in hiding, my people are in camps. If we do not act quickly, all will be lost forever...I ask you to help us...no, I beg you to help us.
sw_L616 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  We are your humble servants...our fate is in your hands.
sw_L617 +++$+++ sw_u10 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BOSS NASS +++$+++ Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans.. Mesa like dis.
sw_L618 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ ...we've sent out patrols. We've already located their starship in the swamp....It won't be long, My Lord.
sw_L619 +++$+++ sw_u11 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ This is an unexpected move for her. It's too aggresive..
sw_L620 +++$+++ sw_u25 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH MAUL +++$+++ Yes, my Master.
sw_L621 +++$+++ sw_u11 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ Be patient... Let them make the first move.
sw_L622 +++$+++ sw_u50 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ GUNGAN LOOKOUT +++$+++ Daza comen!
sw_L623 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ All right. They're here!
sw_L624 +++$+++ sw_u10 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BOSS NASS +++$+++ Yousa doen grand. Jar Jar bringen da Naboo together.
sw_L625 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Oh, no, no, no...
sw_L626 +++$+++ sw_u10 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BOSS NASS +++$+++ So, wesa maken yousa Bombad General.
sw_L627 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ General??! Oh, no..
sw_L628 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ What is the situation?
sw_L629 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw theDroid Army away from the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Pnaka will create a diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy.
sw_L630 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  What do you think, Master Jedi?
sw_L631 +++$+++ sw_u10 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BOSS NASS +++$+++ Wesa ready to do are-sa part.
sw_L632 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting the planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication and their droids will be helpless.
sw_L633 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything depends on it.
sw_L634 +++$+++ sw_u11 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ ...she is more foolish than I thought.
sw_L635 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ We are sending all available troops to meet this army of hers assembling near the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives. We do not expect much resistance.
sw_L636 +++$+++ sw_u25 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH MAUL +++$+++ I feel there is more to this, My Master. The two Jedi may be using the Queen for their own purposes.
sw_L637 +++$+++ sw_u11 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect the Queen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that conenant.... This will work to our advantage...
sw_L638 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord.
sw_L639 +++$+++ sw_u11 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ Proceed. Wipe them put...all of them. INT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - DAY  All is peaceful. SMALL CRITTERS drink out of a large swamp lake. Suddenly there is a disturbance in the middle of the lake. A rush of bubbles, then a GUNGAN SOLDIER riding a KAADU emerges from the water, followed by SEVERAL OTHERS. FROGS and OTHER LITTLE ANIMALS flee in all directions as the GUNGAN ARMY marches through the swamp. The KAADU shake themselves off as they exit the lake. When JAR JAR's KAADU shakes off, JAR JAR falls off.
sw_L640 +++$+++ sw_u51 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ GENERAL CEEL +++$+++ Energize the shields.
sw_L641 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Sure.
sw_L642 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ I thought the battle was going to take place far from here...this is too close!
sw_L643 +++$+++ sw_u4 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RUNE +++$+++ What is going on?
sw_L644 +++$+++ sw_u25 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DARTH MAUL +++$+++ I told you there was more to this...the Jedi are involved.
sw_L645 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Get to your ships!
sw_L646 +++$+++ sw_u52 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ FIGHTER PILOT +++$+++ Better find a new hiding place, kid. I'm taking this ship.
sw_L647 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ My guess is the Viceroy is in the throne room.
sw_L648 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Hey! Wait for me.
sw_L649 +++$+++ sw_u53 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKNI +++$+++ But, I...
sw_L650 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Oh, no...
sw_L651 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  We gotta do something, Artoo.
sw_L652 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  All right, thanks Artoo! Great idea! I'll take over.
sw_L653 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Where's the trigger? Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this one....
sw_L654 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Yeah, all right. "Droid blaster." Yeah!
sw_L655 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Oops...shield up! Always on the right...shields always on the right.
sw_L656 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I know we're moving. I'll shut the energy drive down.
sw_L657 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Oops!! Wrong one.
sw_L658 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I'm not doing anything!
sw_L659 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I know...I didn't push anything.
sw_L660 +++$+++ sw_u16 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RIC OLIE +++$+++ Bravo Flight A, take on the fighters. Flight B, make the run on the transmitter.
sw_L661 +++$+++ sw_u54 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BRAVO TWO +++$+++ Roger, Bravo Leader.
sw_L662 +++$+++ sw_u16 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RIC OLIE +++$+++ Enemy fighters straight ahead!
sw_L663 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The Autopilot is searching for what other ships?
sw_L664 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  There is no manual override, Artoo. You'll have to rewire it or something.
sw_L665 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Look! There they are! That's where the autopilot is taking us.
sw_L666 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ We don't have time for this, Captain.
sw_L667 +++$+++ sw_u51 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ GENERAL CEEL +++$+++ Retreat! Retreat!
sw_L668 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Whoo, boy! This is tense!
sw_L669 +++$+++ sw_u55 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKN +++$+++  : Oops! Artoo, get us off Autopilot!
sw_L670 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I've got control?
sw_L671 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Okay, let's go left!
sw_L672 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Yes...I've got control. You did it, Artoo!
sw_L673 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit and that's what I'm gonna do. Now c'mon!
sw_L674 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Oops! Whoa!
sw_L675 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I'll try spinning, that's a good trick.
sw_L676 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I know we're in trouble! Hang on! The way out of this mess is the way we got into it.
sw_L677 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Which one? This one?
sw_L678 +++$+++ sw_u16 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RIC OLIE +++$+++ Bravo flight...go for the central bridge.
sw_L679 +++$+++ sw_u54 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BRAVO TWO +++$+++ ROger, Bravo Leader.
sw_L680 +++$+++ sw_u16 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RIC OLIE +++$+++ Their deflector shield is too strong. We'll never get through it.
sw_L681 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I know, Artoo! This isn't Podracing!
sw_L682 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  We're hit!
sw_L683 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Great gobs of bantha poo-doo!
sw_L684 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop! Whoa!
sw_L685 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  All right! All right! Get the system started!
sw_L686 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Everything's overheated. All the lights are red.
sw_L687 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Throw down your weapons. They win this round.
sw_L688 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Captain, I said throw down your weapons.
sw_L689 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Dissa bad, berry bombad.
sw_L690 +++$+++ sw_u51 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ GENERAL CEEL +++$+++ Mesa hopen dissa working for da Queen.
sw_L691 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for you to sign the treaty...and end this pointless debate in the Senate.
sw_L692 +++$+++ sw_u56 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ SABE +++$+++ I will not be signing any treaty, Viceroy, because you've lost!
sw_L693 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ After her! This one is a decoy!
sw_L694 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++  Your Queen will not get away with this.
sw_L695 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Now, Viceroy, this is the end of your occupation here.
sw_L696 +++$+++ sw_u1 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ NUTE +++$+++ Don't be absurd. There are too few of you. It won't be long before hundreds of destroyer droids break in to rescue us.
sw_L697 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Uh oh. This is not good.
sw_L698 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  The systems are still overheated, Artoo.
sw_L699 +++$+++ sw_u57 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN +++$+++ Where's your pilot?
sw_L700 +++$+++ sw_u57 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN +++$+++  You're the pilot?
sw_L701 +++$+++ sw_u57 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN +++$+++  Let me see your identification!
sw_L702 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yes...we have ignition.
sw_L703 +++$+++ sw_u57 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN +++$+++  You! Come out of there or we'll blast you!
sw_L704 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Not if I can help it! Shields up!
sw_L705 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  This should stop them.
sw_L706 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  ...and take this!
sw_L707 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Darn...I missed!
sw_L708 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Let's get out of here!
sw_L709 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Now, this is Podracing! Whoopee!
sw_L710 +++$+++ sw_u5 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ TEY HOW +++$+++ Sir, we're losing power... There is some problem with the main reactor...
sw_L711 +++$+++ sw_u2 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ DOFINE +++$+++ Impossible!! I don't...
sw_L712 +++$+++ sw_u54 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BRAVO TWO +++$+++ What's that?? It's blowing up from the inside.
sw_L713 +++$+++ sw_u16 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RIC OLIE +++$+++ I don't know, we didn't hit it.
sw_L714 +++$+++ sw_u58 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BRAVO THREE +++$+++ Look! One of ours! Outta the main hold!!
sw_L715 +++$+++ sw_u9 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Wierdind...
sw_L716 +++$+++ sw_u54 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BRAVO TWO +++$+++ He flew into the hold, behind the deflector shield and blasted the main reactor...
sw_L717 +++$+++ sw_u58 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ BRAVO THREE +++$+++ Amazing... They don't teach that in the academy.
sw_L718 +++$+++ sw_u16 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ RIC OLIE +++$+++ We're all accounted for. Who flew that ship?
sw_L719 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm not going to get into trouble, am I?
sw_L720 +++$+++ sw_u13 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Now, Viceroy, you are going to have to go back to the Senate and explain all this.
sw_L721 +++$+++ sw_u6 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ Congratulations on youer election, Chancellor. It is so good to see you again.
sw_L722 +++$+++ sw_u7 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ It's good to be home. Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty. It is you who should be congratulated. Together we shall bring peace and prosperity to the Republic.
sw_L723 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.
sw_L724 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training.
sw_L725 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the council does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be.
sw_L726 +++$+++ sw_u19 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What will happen to me now?
sw_L727 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ There is no doubt. The mysterious warrior was a Sith.
sw_L728 +++$+++ sw_u39 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Always two there are....no more...no less. A maste and an apprentice.
sw_L729 +++$+++ sw_u38 +++$+++ sw_m0 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ But which one was destroyed, the master or the apprentice?
sw_L730 +++$+++ sw_u59 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYPHO +++$+++ We made it. I guess I was wrong, there was no danger at all.
sw_L731 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Cordé...
sw_L732 +++$+++ sw_u61 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CORDÉ +++$+++ ... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I...
sw_L733 +++$+++ sw_u62 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ No!... No!... No!...
sw_L734 +++$+++ sw_u62 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ I should not have come back.
sw_L735 +++$+++ sw_u59 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYPHO +++$+++ M'Lady, you are still in danger.
sw_L736 +++$+++ sw_u59 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYPHO +++$+++ This vote is very important. You did your duty and Cordé did hers. Now come.  M'Lady, please!
sw_L737 +++$+++ sw_u63 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MAS AMEDDA +++$+++ Order! We shall have order! The motion for the Republic to commission an army takes precedent, and that is what we will vote on at this time.
sw_L738 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ ...My esteemed colleagues, excuse me... I have just received some tragic and disturbing news. Senator Amidala of the Naboo system... Has been assassinated!
sw_L739 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  This grievous blow is especially personal to me. Before I became Chancellor, I served Amidala when she was Queen. She was a great leader who fought for justice, not only in this honourable assembly, but also on her home planet. She was so loved she could have been elected queen for life. She believed in public service, and she fervently believed in democracy. Her death is a great loss to us all. We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom... and as a dear friend.
sw_L740 +++$+++ sw_u65 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SENATOR ASK AAK +++$+++ How many more Senators will die before this civil strife ends! We must confront these rebels now, and they need an army to do it.
sw_L741 +++$+++ sw_u66 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DARSANA +++$+++ Why weren't the Jedi able to stop this assassination? We are no longer safe, under their protection.
sw_L742 +++$+++ sw_u67 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ORN FREE TAA +++$+++ The Republic needs more security now! Before it comes to war.
sw_L743 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Must I remind the Senator from Malastare that negotiations are continuing with the separatists. Peace is our objective here... not war.
sw_L744 +++$+++ sw_u62 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ AMIDALA +++$+++ My noble colleagues, I concur with the Supreme Chancellor. At all costs, we do not want war!
sw_L745 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ It is with great surprise and joy the chair recognises the Senator from Naboo, Padmé Amidala.
sw_L746 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six  others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. I was the target but, more importantly, I believe this security measure before you, was the target. I have led the opposition to build an army... but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure it's passage...
sw_L747 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++  I warn you, if you vote to create this army, war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war first-hand; I do not wish to do it again.
sw_L748 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Wake up, Senators... you must wake up! If you offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives. All will lose their freedom. This decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic. I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. Vote down this security measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does anyone here want that? I cannot believe they do.
sw_L749 +++$+++ sw_u67 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ORN FREE TAA +++$+++ My motion to defer the vote must be dealt with first. That is the rule of law.
sw_L750 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Due to the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion, we will take up these matters tomorrow. Until then, the Senate stands adjourned.
sw_L751 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I don't know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends. More and more star systems are joining the separatists.
sw_L752 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ If they do break away -
sw_L753 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ No! I will not let that happen!
sw_L754 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ But if they do, you must realise there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We are keepers of the peace, not soldiers.
sw_L755 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Master Yoda, do you think it will really come to war?
sw_L756 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Worse than war, I fear... Much worse.
sw_L757 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ What?
sw_L758 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ What do you sense, Master?
sw_L759 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Impossible to see ... The Dark Side clouds everything. But this I am sure of -  Do their duty the Jedi will.
sw_L760 +++$+++ sw_u70 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DAR WAC +++$+++ The loyalist committee has arrived, my Lord.
sw_L761 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Send them in.
sw_L762 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ With you the force is strong... young Senator. To see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart.
sw_L763 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you have any idea who was behind the attack?
sw_L764 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of Naboo.
sw_L765 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I don't wish to disagree but I think that Count Dooku was behind it.
sw_L766 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He wouldn't assassinate anyone, it is not in his character.
sw_L767 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are.
sw_L768 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end?
sw_L769 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it...
sw_L770 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces.
sw_L771 +++$+++ sw_u71 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times?
sw_L772 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the...
sw_L773 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ ..."situation is that serious." No, but I do, Senator.
sw_L774 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Chancellor, please! I don't want any more guards!
sw_L775 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with... an old friend like... Master Kenobi...
sw_L776 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ That's possible. He has just returned from a Border dispute on Ansion.
sw_L777 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ You must remember him, M'Lady... he watched over you during the blockade conflict.
sw_L778 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ This is not necessary, Chancellor.
sw_L779 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing you is unbearable.
sw_L780 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, M'Lady.
sw_L781 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Too little about yourself you worry, Senator, and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger, Padmé. Accept our help.
sw_L782 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I will not like this Republiv, that has stood for over a thousand years, be split in two
sw_L783 +++$+++ sw_u72 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!
sw_L784 +++$+++ sw_u72 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Oops! Wheresa mesa manners? Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I completely forgot myself for a moment there. I have had to learn Diplodiaclect... speak it like a native now. Don't really see the point, actually, but members of the Senate seem to prefer it...
sw_L785 +++$+++ sw_u72 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++  ...and this, I take it, is your apprentice... Nooooooooo! Annie? Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie? (Looks at Anakin) Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen! Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no believen.
sw_L786 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Hi, Jar Jar.
sw_L787 +++$+++ sw_u72 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!
sw_L788 +++$+++ sw_u72 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Lookie... lookie... Oops!... Oh, dear, I'm afraid I've forgotten myself again.
sw_L789 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ It has been far too long Master Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths have crossed again... but I must warn you that I think your presence here is unnecessary.
sw_L790 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Annie??  My goodness you've grown.
sw_L791 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  So have you... grown more beautiful, I mean... and much shorter... for a Senator, I mean.
sw_L792 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Oh Annie, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.
sw_L793 +++$+++ sw_u59 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYPHO +++$+++ I am very grateful you are here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit.
sw_L794 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I don't need more security, I need answers. I want to know who is trying to kill me.
sw_L795 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ We will find out who is trying to kill you Padmé, I promise you.
sw_L796 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course.
sw_L797 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Why?
sw_L798 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security... not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.
sw_L799 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed.  Now if you will excuse me I will retire.
sw_L800 +++$+++ sw_u59 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYPHO +++$+++ Well, I know I feel a lot better having you here. I'll have an officer on every floor and I'll be at the command centre downstairs.
sw_L801 +++$+++ sw_u72 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Mesa busten wit happiness seein Yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad times, bombad times.
sw_L802 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ She didn't even recognise me, Jar Jar. I thought about her every day since we parted... and she's forgotten me completely.
sw_L803 +++$+++ sw_u72 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Shesa happy. Happier den mesa see-en her in longo time.
sw_L804 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yes, my master.
sw_L805 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Why couldn't we see this attack on the Senator?
sw_L806 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force.
sw_L807 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ The propecy is coming true, the Dark Side is growing.
sw_L808 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future. Only going through the Dark Side can we see.
sw_L809 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ It's been ten years, and the Sith still have no shown themselves. Do you think they are behind this?
sw_L810 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ ...Out there, they are. A certainty that is.
sw_L811 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice will be able to bring balance to the Force?
sw_L812 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Only if he chooses to follow his destiny.
sw_L813 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.
sw_L814 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ She covered that camera. I don't think she liked me watching her.
sw_L815 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ She programmed Artoo to warn us if there's an intruder.
sw_L816 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don't we, Master?
sw_L817 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ It was her idea... No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.
sw_L818 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ And yours are?
sw_L819 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't sleep well, anymore.
sw_L820 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't know why I keep dreaming About her now. I haven't seen her since I was little.
sw_L821 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'd rather dream of Padmé. Just Being around her again is... intoxicating.
sw_L822 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ She's not like the others in the Senate, Master.
sw_L823 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Not another lecture, Master. Not on the economics of politics.... It's too early in the morning... and besides, you're generalising. The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.
sw_L824 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I think he is a good man. My instincts are very positive about...
sw_L825 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Stay here!
sw_L826 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic.
sw_L827 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't find a speeder I really liked, with an open cockpit... and with the right speed capabilities... and then you know I had to get a really gonzo color...
sw_L828 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I thought I already did.
sw_L829 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Sorry, I forgot you don't like flying, Master.
sw_L830 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Master, you know I've been flying since before I could walk. I'm very good at this.
sw_L831 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this guy's gonna kill himself any minute now!
sw_L832 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Right - this isn't working.
sw_L833 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Clear that!
sw_L834 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Clear the flag! We're losing power! Hurry!
sw_L835 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ So sorry, Master.
sw_L836 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Sorry, Master!
sw_L837 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ That was crazy!!!
sw_L838 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Ahh, damn.
sw_L839 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ No, we can make it.
sw_L840 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ But it worked... we made it.
sw_L841 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I think we're still alive.
sw_L842 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I could have made it...
sw_L843 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ No we didnt...
sw_L844 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ This is a shortcut... I think.
sw_L845 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Master, if we keep this chase going, that creeps gonna end up deep fried. Personally, Id very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who hes working for...
sw_L846 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Im deeply sorry, Master.
sw_L847 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Excuse me for a moment.
sw_L848 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ She went into that club, Master.
sw_L849 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Sorry, Master.
sw_L850 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yes, Master.
sw_L851 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I know, Master.
sw_L852 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I've heard this lesson before...
sw_L853 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I try, Master.
sw_L854 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Don't say that Master... You're the closest thing I have to a father... I love you. I don't want to cause you pain.
sw_L855 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I will. I'll do better, I promise.
sw_L856 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I think he's a she...
sw_L857 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Where are you going, Master?
sw_L858 +++$+++ sw_u74 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO +++$+++ Wanna buy some death sticks?
sw_L859 +++$+++ sw_u75 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ELAN +++$+++ I don't want to sell you death- sticks.
sw_L860 +++$+++ sw_u75 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ELAN +++$+++ I want to go home and rethink my life.
sw_L861 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Easy... Official business. Go back to your drinks.
sw_L862 +++$+++ sw_u76 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ZAM WESSEL +++$+++ The Senator from Naboo.
sw_L863 +++$+++ sw_u76 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ZAM WESSEL +++$+++ It was just a job.
sw_L864 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Tell us!
sw_L865 +++$+++ sw_u76 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ZAM WESSEL +++$+++ That Senator's gonna die soon anyway, and the next one won't make the same mistake I did...
sw_L866 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Who hired you? Tell us... tell us now!
sw_L867 +++$+++ sw_u77 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ZAM +++$+++ It was a Bounty Hunter called...
sw_L868 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Representative Binks. I know I can count on you.
sw_L869 +++$+++ sw_u72 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Yousa betchen mesa bottums.
sw_L870 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ What?!
sw_L871 +++$+++ sw_u72 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++  Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean, I am honoured to accept this heavy burden. I take on this responsibility with deep humility tinged with an overwhelming pride. (pompously) It is not every day that I am called upon to...
sw_L872 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I don't wish to hold you up. I'm sure you have a great deal to do.
sw_L873 +++$+++ sw_u72 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Of course, M'lady.
sw_L874 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I do not like this idea of hiding.
sw_L875 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Don't worry. Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find that bounty hunter.
sw_L876 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++  I haven't worked for a year to defeat the "Military Creation Act" not to be here when its fate is decided.
sw_L877 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.
sw_L878 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and you don't have a very firm grip on politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time.
sw_L879 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying to...
sw_L880 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Annie! No!
sw_L881 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Please don't call me that.
sw_L882 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ What?
sw_L883 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Annie...
sw_L884 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I've always called you that... it is your name, isn't it?
sw_L885 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ It's Anakin. When you say Annie it's like I'm still a little boy... and I'm not.
sw_L886 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible to deny you've...  ...that you've grown up.
sw_L887 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it...
sw_L888 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow.
sw_L889 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only... although I'm a Padawan learner, in some ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I'm too unpredictable... Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it... I know I started my training late... but he won't let me move on.
sw_L890 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ That must be frustrating.
sw_L891 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ It's worse... he's overly critical. He never listens! He just doesn't understand! It's not fair!
sw_L892 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I'm sorry... You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew, when he didn't get his way.
sw_L893 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm not whining! I'm not.
sw_L894 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I didn't say it to hurt you.
sw_L895 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I know...
sw_L896 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin...
sw_L897 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++  Don't try to grow up too fast.
sw_L898 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I am grown up. You said it yourself.
sw_L899 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Please don't look at me like that.
sw_L900 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Why not?
sw_L901 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Because I can see what you're thinking.
sw_L902 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers too?
sw_L903 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ It makes me feel uncomfortable.
sw_L904 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Sorry, M'lady.
sw_L905 +++$+++ sw_u59 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYPHO +++$+++ Be safe, m'lady.
sw_L906 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorme... the threat's on you two now.
sw_L907 +++$+++ sw_u79 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DORME +++$+++ He'll be safe with me.
sw_L908 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ You'll be fine.
sw_L909 +++$+++ sw_u79 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DORME +++$+++ It's not me, M'Lady. I worry about you. What if they realise I'm not you?
sw_L910 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++  Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is.
sw_L911 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yes, Master.
sw_L912 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.
sw_L913 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Time to go.
sw_L914 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I know.
sw_L915 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ May the Force be with you, Master.
sw_L916 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Suddenly, I'm afraid...
sw_L917 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm kinda scared too. This is my first assignment on my own.
sw_L918 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ There's nothing to worry about... we have Artoo with us.
sw_L919 +++$+++ sw_u59 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYPHO +++$+++ I'd be more concerned about her doing something, than him.
sw_L920 +++$+++ sw_u80 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SERVER +++$+++ Keep moving! Keep moving!
sw_L921 +++$+++ sw_u81 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ FOOD SERVER +++$+++  Hey! No Droids!
sw_L922 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ No, no, Mom, no...
sw_L923 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  What?
sw_L924 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ You seemed to be having a nightmare.
sw_L925 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++  Are you hungry?
sw_L926 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Thank you.
sw_L927 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ We went into lightspeed a while ago.
sw_L928 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I've thought about it every day since I left. It's by far the most beautiful place I've ever seen...
sw_L929 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception.
sw_L930 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception.
sw_L931 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like...
sw_L932 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Or be with the people I love.
sw_L933 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.
sw_L934 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love.
sw_L935 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ You have changed so much
sw_L936 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either.
sw_L937 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ It hasn't...
sw_L938 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualise the Force, those hills are what I see.
sw_L939 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I love Naboo.
sw_L940 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++  Were you dreaming about you mother earlier, weren't you?
sw_L941 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yes... I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. I don't want to lose it. Recently I've been seeing her in my dreams... vivid dreams... scary dreams. I worry about her.
sw_L942 +++$+++ sw_u82 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ HERMIONE +++$+++ Can I help ya?
sw_L943 +++$+++ sw_u83 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ HERMIONE BAGWA +++$+++ Waddya want him for?
sw_L944 +++$+++ sw_u83 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ HERMIONE BAGWA +++$+++ Someone to see ya, honey  A Jedi, by the looks of him.
sw_L945 +++$+++ sw_u84 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DEXTER JETTSTER +++$+++ Obi-Wan!
sw_L946 +++$+++ sw_u84 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DEXTER JETTSTER +++$+++ Take a seat! Be right with ya!
sw_L947 +++$+++ sw_u83 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ HERMIONE BAGWA +++$+++ You want a cup of ardees?
sw_L948 +++$+++ sw_u84 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DEXTER JETTSTER +++$+++ Hey, ol' buddy!
sw_L949 +++$+++ sw_u84 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DEXTER JETTSTER +++$+++ So, my friend. What can I do for ya?
sw_L950 +++$+++ sw_u84 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DEXTER JETTSTER +++$+++ Well, whattaya know...
sw_L951 +++$+++ sw_u84 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DEXTER JETTSTER +++$+++  I ain't seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel beyond the Outer Rim!
sw_L952 +++$+++ sw_u84 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DEXTER JETTSTER +++$+++ This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino Kyberdart.
sw_L953 +++$+++ sw_u84 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DEXTER JETTSTER +++$+++ It's these funny little cuts on the side give it away... Those analysis droids you've got over there only focus on symbols, you know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom.
sw_L954 +++$+++ sw_u84 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DEXTER JETTSTER +++$+++ No, it's beyond the Outer Rim. I'd say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze, toward the south. It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find. Those Kaminoans keep to themselves. They're cloners. Damned good ones, too.
sw_L955 +++$+++ sw_u84 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DEXTER JETTSTER +++$+++ It depends.
sw_L956 +++$+++ sw_u84 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DEXTER JETTSTER +++$+++ On how good your manners are... and how big your pocketbook is...
sw_L957 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ If I grew up here, I don't think I'd ever leave.
sw_L958 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++  I doubt that.
sw_L959 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about... The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers...
sw_L960 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ ...and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the Capital, I was very young... I'd never seen a waterfall before. I though they were so beautiful... I never dreamed one day I'd live in the palace.
sw_L961 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?
sw_L962 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++  No! That was the last thing I thought of. My dream was to help in the "Refugee Relief Movement." I never thought of running for elected office. But the more history I studied, the more I realised how much good politicians could do. So when I was eight, I joined the "Apprentice Legislators", then later on became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before I knew it, I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.
sw_L963 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.
sw_L964 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Popular rule is not democracy, Annie. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried About me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now... My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids... but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn't refuse her.
sw_L965 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I agree! I think the Republic needs you... I'm glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.
sw_L966 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I think so too.
sw_L967 +++$+++ sw_u85 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ QUEEN JAMILLIA +++$+++ We've been worried about you.  I'm so glad you're safe, Padmé.
sw_L968 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Thank you, Your Highness. I only Wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote.
sw_L969 +++$+++ sw_u86 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SIO BIBBLE +++$+++ Given the circumstances, Senator, you know it was the only decision Her Highness could have made.
sw_L970 +++$+++ sw_u85 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ QUEEN JAMILLIA +++$+++ How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists?
sw_L971 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.
sw_L972 +++$+++ sw_u86 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SIO BIBBLE +++$+++ It's unthinkable! There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic!
sw_L973 +++$+++ sw_u85 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ QUEEN JAMILLIA +++$+++ Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?
sw_L974 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help.
sw_L975 +++$+++ sw_u85 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ QUEEN JAMILLIA +++$+++ The armies of commerce! Why has Nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?
sw_L976 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I'm afraid that, despite the Chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds.
sw_L977 +++$+++ sw_u86 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SIO BIBBLE +++$+++ It's outrageous! After all of those hearings, and the four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control everything?
sw_L978 +++$+++ sw_u85 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ QUEEN JAMILLIA +++$+++ Remember, Counsellor, the courts were able to reduce the Federation's armies. That's a move in the right direction.
sw_L979 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.
sw_L980 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were told.
sw_L981 +++$+++ sw_u85 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ QUEEN JAMILLIA +++$+++ We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.
sw_L982 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Let's pray that day never comes.
sw_L983 +++$+++ sw_u85 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ QUEEN JAMILLIA +++$+++ In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.
sw_L984 +++$+++ sw_u86 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SIO BIBBLE +++$+++  What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?
sw_L985 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He's still a Padawan learner. I was thinking...
sw_L986 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Hey, hold on a minute!
sw_L987 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.
sw_L988 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady.
sw_L989 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well... that is why we're here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance.
sw_L990 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Sorry, M'Lady.
sw_L991 +++$+++ sw_u86 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SIO BIBBLE +++$+++  She is right. The Lake Country is the most remote part of Naboo. Not many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain.
sw_L992 +++$+++ sw_u85 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ QUEEN JAMILLIA +++$+++ Perfect. It's settled then.
sw_L993 +++$+++ sw_u85 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ QUEEN JAMILLIA +++$+++  Padmé, I had an audience with your father yesterday. I told him what was happening. He hopes you will visit your mother before you leave... your family's very worried about you.
sw_L994 +++$+++ sw_u87 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOCASTA NU +++$+++ Did you call for assistance?
sw_L995 +++$+++ sw_u87 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOCASTA NU +++$+++ He has a powerful face, doesn't he? He was one of the most brilliant Jedi I have had the privilege of knowing.
sw_L996 +++$+++ sw_u87 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOCASTA NU +++$+++  The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku was the most recent and the most painful. No one likes to talk about it. His leaving was a great loss to the Order.
sw_L997 +++$+++ sw_u87 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOCASTA NU +++$+++ Well, one might say, he was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the Council... much like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
sw_L998 +++$+++ sw_u87 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOCASTA NU +++$+++ Oh, yes. They were alike in many ways. Very individual thinkers... idealists...
sw_L999 +++$+++ sw_u87 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOCASTA NU +++$+++ (continuing He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi. He wanted to be the best. With a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match. His knowledge of the Force was... unique. In the end, I think he left because he lost faith in the Republic. He believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. He always had very high expectations of government. He disappeared for nine or ten years, then he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement.
sw_L1000 +++$+++ sw_u87 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOCASTA NU +++$+++ Well, I'm sure you didn't call me over here for a history lesson. Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?
sw_L1001 +++$+++ sw_u87 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOCASTA NU +++$+++ Kamino? It's not a system I'M familiar with... Let me see...
sw_L1002 +++$+++ sw_u87 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOCASTA NU +++$+++  Are you sure you have the right co-ordinates?
sw_L1003 +++$+++ sw_u87 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOCASTA NU +++$+++ No co-ordinates? It sounds like the kind of directions you'd get from a street tout... some old miner or Furbog trader.
sw_L1004 +++$+++ sw_u87 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOCASTA NU +++$+++ Are you sure it exists?
sw_L1005 +++$+++ sw_u87 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOCASTA NU +++$+++ Let me do a gravitational scan.
sw_L1006 +++$+++ sw_u87 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOCASTA NU +++$+++ There are some inconsistencies here. Maybe the planet you're looking for was destroyed.
sw_L1007 +++$+++ sw_u87 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOCASTA NU +++$+++ It ought to be. Unless it was very recent.  I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exist.
sw_L1008 +++$+++ sw_u87 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOCASTA NU +++$+++ The archives are comprehensive and totally secure, my young Jedi. One thing you may be absolutely sure of - if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!
sw_L1009 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ There's my house!
sw_L1010 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  What? Don't say you're shy!
sw_L1011 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  No, but I...
sw_L1012 +++$+++ sw_u88 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ RYOO & POOJA +++$+++ Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!
sw_L1013 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Ryoo!! Pooja!!
sw_L1014 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  I'm so happy to see you! This is Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and this is Pooja.
sw_L1015 +++$+++ sw_u88 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ RYOO & POOJA +++$+++ Artoo!!!
sw_L1016 +++$+++ sw_u89 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SOLA +++$+++  They're eating over at Jev Narran's later, Mom. They just had a snack. They'll be fine.
sw_L1017 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.
sw_L1018 +++$+++ sw_u89 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SOLA +++$+++ Hello, Anakin.
sw_L1019 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Hello.
sw_L1020 +++$+++ sw_u90 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOBAL +++$+++ You're just in time for dinner. I hope you're hungry, Anakin.
sw_L1021 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ A little.
sw_L1022 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ He's being polite, Mom. We're starving.
sw_L1023 +++$+++ sw_u91 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ RUWEE +++$+++  You came to the right place at the right time. Sit down, son.
sw_L1024 +++$+++ sw_u90 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOBAL +++$+++  Honey, it's so good to see you safe. We were so worried.
sw_L1025 +++$+++ sw_u91 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ RUWEE +++$+++ Dear...
sw_L1026 +++$+++ sw_u90 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOBAL +++$+++ I know, I know... but I had to say it. Now it's done.
sw_L1027 +++$+++ sw_u89 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SOLA +++$+++ Well, this is exciting! Do you know, Anakin, you're the first boyfriend my sister's ever brought home?
sw_L1028 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend! He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me.
sw_L1029 +++$+++ sw_u92 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOVAL +++$+++ A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They didn't tell us it was that serious!
sw_L1030 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ It's not, Mom, I promise.  Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis?
sw_L1031 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  He grew up.
sw_L1032 +++$+++ sw_u90 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOBAL +++$+++ Honey, when are you going to settle down? Haven't you had enough of that life? I certainly have!
sw_L1033 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Mom, I'm not in any danger.
sw_L1034 +++$+++ sw_u91 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ RUWEE +++$+++  Is she?
sw_L1035 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ ...Yes... I'm afraid she is.
sw_L1036 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  But not much.
sw_L1037 +++$+++ sw_u91 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ RUWEE +++$+++ Sometimes I wish I'd traveled more... but I must say, I'm happy here.
sw_L1038 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Padme tells me you teach at the university?
sw_L1039 +++$+++ sw_u91 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ RUWEE +++$+++  Yes, and before that, I was a builder. I also worked for the Refugee Relief Movement, when I was very young.
sw_L1040 +++$+++ sw_u89 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SOLA +++$+++ Why haven't you told us about him?
sw_L1041 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ What's there to talk about?  He's just a boy.
sw_L1042 +++$+++ sw_u89 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SOLA +++$+++ A boy? Have you seen the way he looks at you?
sw_L1043 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Sola - stop it!
sw_L1044 +++$+++ sw_u89 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SOLA +++$+++ It's obvious he has feelings for you. Are you saying, little baby sister, that you haven't noticed?
sw_L1045 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I'm not your baby sister, Sola. Anakin and I are friends... our relationship is strictly professional.  Mom, would you tell her to stop it?
sw_L1046 +++$+++ sw_u89 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SOLA +++$+++  Well, maybe you haven't noticed the way he looks at you. I think you're afraid to.
sw_L1047 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Cut it out.
sw_L1048 +++$+++ sw_u90 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOBAL +++$+++ Sola's just concerned... we all are.
sw_L1049 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What I'm doing is important.
sw_L1050 +++$+++ sw_u90 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JOBAL +++$+++ You've done your service, Padmé. It's time you had a life of your own. You're missing so much!
sw_L1051 +++$+++ sw_u91 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ RUWEE +++$+++ Now tell me, son. How serious is this thing? How much danger is my daughter really in?
sw_L1052 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there'll be more. My Master is tracking down the assassins. I'm sure he'll find out who they are. This situation, won't last long.
sw_L1053 +++$+++ sw_u91 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ RUWEE +++$+++ I don't want anything to happen to her.
sw_L1054 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't either.
sw_L1055 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Don't worry, this won't take long.
sw_L1056 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I just want to get there before dark.
sw_L1057 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  You still live at home.
sw_L1058 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I move around so much, I've never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.
sw_L1059 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mom was.
sw_L1060 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Is this you?
sw_L1061 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ That was when I went with the Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I'm holding? His name was N'a-kee-tula, which means sweethear. He was so full of life,. All those kids were. I did everything I could to save him, but he died... they all did. They were never able to adapt... to live off their native planet.
sw_L1062 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference?
sw_L1063 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Don't think... feel... be as one with the Force. Help you, it will.  Younglings - enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him.
sw_L1064 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++  Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan.
sw_L1065 +++$+++ sw_u93 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CHILDREN +++$+++ Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!
sw_L1066 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ What help to you, can I be?
sw_L1067 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it, we will try...
sw_L1068 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Most interesting. Gravitys silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be?
sw_L1069 +++$+++ sw_u94 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JEDI CHILD JACK +++$+++ Because someone erased it from the archive memory.
sw_L1070 +++$+++ sw_u93 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CHILDREN +++$+++ Thats right! Yes! Thats what happened! Someone erased it!
sw_L1071 +++$+++ sw_u95 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JEDI CHILD MAY +++$+++ If the planet blew up, the gravity would go away.
sw_L1072 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will.
sw_L1073 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++  Much harder to answer, that question is.
sw_L1074 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water.
sw_L1075 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.
sw_L1076 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ ...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.
sw_L1077 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I dont like sand. Its coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everythings soft... and smooth...
sw_L1078 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.
sw_L1079 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Everything here is magical.
sw_L1080 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasnt.
sw_L1081 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway...
sw_L1082 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself.
sw_L1083 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I think it's true...
sw_L1084 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I shouldn't have done that.
sw_L1085 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm sorry. When I'm around you, my mind is no longer my own.
sw_L1086 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ It's the situation... the stress...
sw_L1087 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ ...the view.
sw_L1088 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Be wary, this disturbance in the Force is growing stronger.
sw_L1089 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ The Council is confident in this decision, Obi-Wan.
sw_L1090 +++$+++ sw_u96 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ He has exceptional skills. The Council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true, he weill be the one to bring balance to the Force.
sw_L1091 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ There's something else?
sw_L1092 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Why?
sw_L1093 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Probing the Dark Side is a dangerous process. He could be in seclusion for days... May the force be with you.
sw_L1094 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You did that?
sw_L1095 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What?
sw_L1096 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ That! Now stop it!
sw_L1097 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  Anakin!!
sw_L1098 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm not really supposed to do that... for fun, I mean. If Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be very grumpy.
sw_L1099 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ May I tell you something?
sw_L1100 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I don't know.
sw_L1101 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Then how can I tell you?
sw_L1102 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition.
sw_L1103 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you.
sw_L1104 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin, don't...
sw_L1105 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask...
sw_L1106 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me.
sw_L1107 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ ...I can't. We can't. It's just not possible.
sw_L1108 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Anything's possible. Padme, please listen...
sw_L1109 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.
sw_L1110 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that.
sw_L1111 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Annie, it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me.
sw_L1112 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can't.
sw_L1113 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love.
sw_L1114 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ It wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret.
sw_L1115 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?
sw_L1116 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ ...No, you're right. It would destroy us.
sw_L1117 +++$+++ sw_u97 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ TAUN WE +++$+++ Welcome to Tipoca City, Master Jedi.
sw_L1118 +++$+++ sw_u97 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ TAUN WE +++$+++ Everything is ready. The Prime Minister expects you.
sw_L1119 +++$+++ sw_u97 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ TAUN WE +++$+++ Of course! He is anxious to see you. After all these years, we were beginning to think you weren't coming. Now please, this way!
sw_L1120 +++$+++ sw_u97 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ TAUN WE +++$+++ May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino... and this is Master Jedi...
sw_L1121 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ Please...
sw_L1122 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ I trust you are going to enjoy your stay. We are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season.
sw_L1123 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ And now to business. You will be delighted to hear we are on schedule. Two hundred thousand units are ready, with another million well on the way.
sw_L1124 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas that we have every confidence his order will be met on time and in full. He is well, I hope?
sw_L1125 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not?
sw_L1126 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++  You must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.
sw_L1127 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I don't know...
sw_L1128 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Sure you do... you just don't want to tell me.
sw_L1129 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?
sw_L1130 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded.
sw_L1131 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ All right... his name was Palo. I was twelve. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes.
sw_L1132 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ All right, I get the picture... whatever happened to him?
sw_L1133 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I went on to become a Queen. He went on to become an artist.
sw_L1134 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Maybe he was the smart one.
sw_L1135 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You really don't like politicians, do you?
sw_L1136 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them.  I don't think the system works.
sw_L1137 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ How would you have it work?
sw_L1138 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.
sw_L1139 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.
sw_L1140 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Then they should be made to.
sw_L1141 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ By whom? Who's going to make them?
sw_L1142 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't know. Someone.
sw_L1143 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You?
sw_L1144 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Of course not me.
sw_L1145 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ But someone.
sw_L1146 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Someone wise.
sw_L1147 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.
sw_L1148 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Well, if it works...
sw_L1149 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ You're making fun of me.
sw_L1150 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  On no, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator.
sw_L1151 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ You're so bad!
sw_L1152 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You're always so serious. Always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders.
sw_L1153 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++  Magnificent, aren't they?
sw_L1154 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. As a result they are totally obedient, taking any order without question.
sw_L1155 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand- picked Jango Fett himself.
sw_L1156 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he's free to come and go as he pleases.
sw_L1157 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious isn't it?
sw_L1158 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration...
sw_L1159 +++$+++ sw_u97 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ TAUN WE +++$+++ I would be most happy to arrange it, for you.
sw_L1160 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ Oh yes, it's essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now, we can do it in half the time. Those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago, when Sido-dyas first placed the order, and they're already mature...
sw_L1161 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ About five years ago.
sw_L1162 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ They're immensely superior to droids, capable of independent thought and action.
sw_L1163 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ I'd hoped you would be pleased.
sw_L1164 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ Himself? Of course not. This army is for the Republic?
sw_L1165 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ We are also very much agasint this Count Dooku and his seccessionist movement. We are proud to be of help to the Republic.
sw_L1166 +++$+++ sw_u97 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ TAUN WE +++$+++ I have arranged for you to meet Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep well.
sw_L1167 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ No. Whoever placed that order was not a Jedi, I can assure you.
sw_L1168 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Who he is working for... discover that, you must.
sw_L1169 +++$+++ sw_u99 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ WINDU +++$+++ A clone army! Ordered by someone in the Senate perhaps... Someone's out to start a war.
sw_L1170 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Inform the chancellor of this, we must.
sw_L1171 +++$+++ sw_u99 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ WINDU +++$+++ Who do you think this impostor Sido-Dyas, could be?
sw_L1172 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ No...No...No...Mom!...Don't, no, don't!
sw_L1173 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Don't go.
sw_L1174 +++$+++ sw_u100 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PAMDE +++$+++ I don't want to disturb you.
sw_L1175 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Your presence is soothing.
sw_L1176 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You had a nightmare again last night.
sw_L1177 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Jedi don't have nightmares.
sw_L1178 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I heard you.
sw_L1179 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She's suffering, Padme. She is in pain...They're killing her!  I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I have to help her! I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a choice.
sw_L1180 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Annie, I told you I wouldn't let you give up your future for me. I'll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won't be disobeying your mandate.
sw_L1181 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What about Master Obi-wan?
sw_L1182 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I guess we won't tell him, will we?
sw_L1183 +++$+++ sw_u97 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ TAUN WE +++$+++ Boba, is your father here?
sw_L1184 +++$+++ sw_u97 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ TAUN WE +++$+++  May we see him?
sw_L1185 +++$+++ sw_u101 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ BOBA FETT +++$+++ Sure.
sw_L1186 +++$+++ sw_u101 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ BOBA FETT +++$+++ Dad! Taun We's here!
sw_L1187 +++$+++ sw_u97 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ TAUN WE +++$+++ Welcome back, Jango. Was your trip productive?
sw_L1188 +++$+++ sw_u102 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO FETT +++$+++ Fairly.
sw_L1189 +++$+++ sw_u97 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ TAUN WE +++$+++ This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. He's come to check on our progress.
sw_L1190 +++$+++ sw_u102 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO FETT +++$+++ That right?
sw_L1191 +++$+++ sw_u102 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO FETT +++$+++ I'm just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe, Master Jedi.
sw_L1192 +++$+++ sw_u103 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO +++$+++ Once or twice.
sw_L1193 +++$+++ sw_u103 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO +++$+++  Possibly...
sw_L1194 +++$+++ sw_u103 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO +++$+++ Boba, close the door.
sw_L1195 +++$+++ sw_u103 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO +++$+++  Master who?
sw_L1196 +++$+++ sw_u103 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO +++$+++ Never heard of him. I was recuited by a man called Darth Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden.
sw_L1197 +++$+++ sw_u97 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ TAUN WE +++$+++ Sido-Dyas told us to expect him. And he showed up just when your Jedi Master said he would. We have kept the Jedis involvement a secret until your arrival, just as your Master requested.
sw_L1198 +++$+++ sw_u103 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO +++$+++ Do you like your army?
sw_L1199 +++$+++ sw_u103 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO +++$+++  They'll do their job well, I'll guarantee that.
sw_L1200 +++$+++ sw_u103 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO +++$+++ Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.
sw_L1201 +++$+++ sw_u104 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ BOBA +++$+++ What is it, Dad?
sw_L1202 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Wait, please.
sw_L1203 +++$+++ sw_u105 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++  No, not that one - that one!
sw_L1204 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Excuse me, Watto.
sw_L1205 +++$+++ sw_u105 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++  What?
sw_L1206 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I said excuse me.
sw_L1207 +++$+++ sw_u105 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++  Shut down.
sw_L1208 +++$+++ sw_u105 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++  What? I don't know you... What can I do for you? You look like a Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn't do it.
sw_L1209 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Let me help you with that.
sw_L1210 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.
sw_L1211 +++$+++ sw_u105 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!
sw_L1212 +++$+++ sw_u105 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++  You are Annie! It is you! You little womp rat.
sw_L1213 +++$+++ sw_u105 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++  You sure sprouted Weehoo! A Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe you couldda help wit some daedbeats who owe...
sw_L1214 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ My mother...
sw_L1215 +++$+++ sw_u105 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine no more. I sold her.
sw_L1216 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Sold her...
sw_L1217 +++$+++ sw_u105 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you know, business is business. Sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars. Least I think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her. Can ya beat that?
sw_L1218 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Do you know where they are?
sw_L1219 +++$+++ sw_u105 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ Long way from here... someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think...
sw_L1220 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'd like to know.
sw_L1221 +++$+++ sw_u105 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ WATTO +++$+++ Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's go look in my records.
sw_L1222 +++$+++ sw_u98 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ LAMA SU +++$+++ Tell your Council the first battalions are ready. And remind them that if they need more troops, we will need time to grow them.
sw_L1223 +++$+++ sw_u101 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ BOBA FETT +++$+++ Dad!!
sw_L1224 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Stay with the ship, Artoo.
sw_L1225 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Threepio?
sw_L1226 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Hello, Threepio.
sw_L1227 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I've come to see my mother.
sw_L1228 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Threepio, what's happened?
sw_L1229 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here looking for my mother.
sw_L1230 +++$+++ sw_u106 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ Owen Lars... I guess I'm your step-brother.  This is my girlfriend, Beru.
sw_L1231 +++$+++ sw_u107 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ BERU +++$+++ Hello.
sw_L1232 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I'm Padme.
sw_L1233 +++$+++ sw_u106 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ I had a feeling you might show up some day.
sw_L1234 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Is my mother here?
sw_L1235 +++$+++ sw_u108 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CLIEGG +++$+++ No, she's not.
sw_L1236 +++$+++ sw_u108 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CLIEGG +++$+++  Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife... Come on inside. We have a lot to talk about.
sw_L1237 +++$+++ sw_u108 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CLIEGG +++$+++ Your mother had gone out early, like she always did, to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporatos. From the tracks, she was about halfway when they took her. Those Tuskens walk like men, but they're vicious, mindless monsters. Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. Three more are still out there looking. I'd be with them, only... I just couldn't ride any more... until I heal.
sw_L1238 +++$+++ sw_u108 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CLIEGG +++$+++  This isn't the way I wanted to meet you, son. This isn't how your mother and I planned it. I don't want to give up on her, but she's been gone a month. There's little hope she's lasted this long.
sw_L1239 +++$+++ sw_u106 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ Where are you going?
sw_L1240 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ To find my mother.
sw_L1241 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ No, Annie!
sw_L1242 +++$+++ sw_u108 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CLIEGG +++$+++ She's daed, son. Accept it.
sw_L1243 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I can feel her pain, and I will find her. I know she's alive.
sw_L1244 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You are going to have to stay here. These are good people, Padme. You'll be safe.
sw_L1245 +++$+++ sw_u106 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ Take my speeder bike.
sw_L1246 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin...
sw_L1247 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I trust you'll watch over her, Owen.
sw_L1248 +++$+++ sw_u106 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ Don't worry.
sw_L1249 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I won't be long.
sw_L1250 +++$+++ sw_u102 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO FETT +++$+++ Nearly there, son.
sw_L1251 +++$+++ sw_u101 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ BOBA FETT +++$+++ Dad, look!!
sw_L1252 +++$+++ sw_u102 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO FETT +++$+++ Hang on!
sw_L1253 +++$+++ sw_u101 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ BOBA FETT +++$+++ Dad! Watch out!
sw_L1254 +++$+++ sw_u102 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO FETT +++$+++ Stay calm, son. We'll be fine. That Jedi won't be able to follow us through this.
sw_L1255 +++$+++ sw_u101 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ BOBA FETT +++$+++ Got him! Yeahhhhh!
sw_L1256 +++$+++ sw_u102 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO FETT +++$+++ We won't see him again.
sw_L1257 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just can't sleep.
sw_L1258 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I guess you're lucky.
sw_L1259 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You're not happy here?
sw_L1260 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Being like what?
sw_L1261 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I guess I wouldn't like it at all.
sw_L1262 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Maybe we can do something about it.
sw_L1263 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Why not? They seem to have a box of old coverings here.
sw_L1264 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Let's see, if we put this... here...
sw_L1265 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You'll have to be quiet, Threepio. Hold still, please.
sw_L1266 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Mom... Mom... Mom...
sw_L1267 +++$+++ sw_u109 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Annie...? Is it you?
sw_L1268 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Im here, Mom. Youre safe. Hang on. Im going to get you out of here...
sw_L1269 +++$+++ sw_u109 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ Im so glad... to see you, Annie... Now... I am complete...
sw_L1270 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Just stay with me, Mom. Im going to make you well again. Everythings going to be fine.
sw_L1271 +++$+++ sw_u109 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SHMI +++$+++ You look so handsome. My son... my grown-up son. Im so proud of you, Annie... so proud... I missed you so much... I love...
sw_L1272 +++$+++ sw_u71 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ That's outrageous! The treaty forbids the Trade Federation from building up an army. What are they doing?!
sw_L1273 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Those Geonosian foundries are part of the Techno Union. We will call in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions.
sw_L1274 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ With the forename Darth, a Sith he must be.
sw_L1275 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Our missing apprentice. They are playing their hand at last.
sw_L1276 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are.
sw_L1277 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Be careful, Obi-Wan. This investigation is becoming less than routine. Do you need help?
sw_L1278 +++$+++ sw_u71 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war... there can be no doubt of that.
sw_L1279 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.
sw_L1280 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ We must stop them soon before they're fully ready.
sw_L1281 +++$+++ sw_u65 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SENATOR ASK AAK +++$+++ The debate is over, we need that clone army now!
sw_L1282 +++$+++ sw_u71 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Unfortunately, the debate is not over. The Senate will never be able to approve the use of that army before the separatists attack.
sw_L1283 +++$+++ sw_u63 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MAS AMEDDA +++$+++ This is a crisis! If the Senate votes the Chancellor emergency powers, he could approve the use of the army in a minute.
sw_L1284 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Please, please, I don't wish to have emergency powers. That's too extreme a solution. It's akin to a dictatorship. We must rely on the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many are available to go to Geonosis?
sw_L1285 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Two Hundred,... less or more.
sw_L1286 +++$+++ sw_u71 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ With all due respect for the Jedi Order, two hundred will be no match for hundreds of thousands of battle droids.
sw_L1287 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Patience. We should wait for Obi- Wan to report back. We don't know that Count Dooku has made a treaty with the Corporate Alliance, it's speculation.
sw_L1288 +++$+++ sw_u65 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SENATOR ASK AAK +++$+++ But we must prepare for the worst. I'm going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the Chancellor at the next session. We must not wait!
sw_L1289 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Out of the question, Senator! You and I are too closely aligned. The issue will become partisan and debates will begin. The proposal must come from a neutral source.
sw_L1290 +++$+++ sw_u63 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MAS AMEDDA +++$+++ If only Senator Amidala were here.
sw_L1291 +++$+++ sw_u72 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Supreme Chancellor... my august colleagues, I would be proud to propose the motion in question. This is a grave situation, and I'm sure Senator Amidala, and the Queen of Naboo would agree.
sw_L1292 +++$+++ sw_u65 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SENATOR ASK AAK +++$+++ Thank you, Representative Binks.
sw_L1293 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ If called upon, I will serve. But it will be the saddest day of my life.
sw_L1294 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ There!
sw_L1295 +++$+++ sw_u106 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ Great! You look perfect.
sw_L1296 +++$+++ sw_u110 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++  Thank you.
sw_L1297 +++$+++ sw_u106 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++  Well, Padme, I think he should be yours from now on... I know that is what my Mom would want.

sw_L1304 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm going after him!
sw_L1305 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to Coruscant.
sw_L1306 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yeah, you're right, you're right.
sw_L1307 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you, Anakin, is to stay where you are. Protect the Senator at all costs. That is your priority.
sw_L1308 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Understood, Master.
sw_L1309 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away.
sw_L1310 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ If he's still alive.
sw_L1311 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Annie, are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He's your friend... your mentor...
sw_L1312 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ ...He's like my father, but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.
sw_L1313 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ He gave you strict orders to protect me...
sw_L1314 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  ...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan. So if you plan to protect me, you will have to come along.
sw_L1315 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ The longer we wait, the stronger Dooku's armies become. We cannot wait for the Senate to make up its mind about granting the Chancellor emergency powers, in order to be able to use that clone army... We have the authority to go now. We must go now.
sw_L1316 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred Jedi send. Enough, let's hope they are.
sw_L1317 +++$+++ sw_u63 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MAS AMEDDA +++$+++ Order! Order!!
sw_L1318 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ In the regrettable absence of Senator Amidala, the chair recognises Senior Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar Binks.
sw_L1319 +++$+++ sw_u72 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Senators, dellow felagates...
sw_L1320 +++$+++ sw_u63 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MAS AMEDDA +++$+++ Order! The Senate will accord the Representative the courtesy of a hearing!
sw_L1321 +++$+++ sw_u72 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ In response to the direct threat to the Republic from the Confederacy of Independent Systems, I propose that the Senate gives immediate emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor.
sw_L1322 +++$+++ sw_u72 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++  Who can deny these are exceptional times? Exceptional times demand exceptional measures! Exceptional measures demand exceptional men!
sw_L1323 +++$+++ sw_u67 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ORN FREE TAA +++$+++ We won't support a dictator.
sw_L1324 +++$+++ sw_u72 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ That is the sentiment every one of us agrees with! And when the shadow of war has dispersed and the bright day of liberty has dawned once again, the power we now give to the Supreme Chancellor will be gladly, and swiftly returned. Out ancient liberties will be restored to us, burnished even more brightly than before!
sw_L1325 +++$+++ sw_u64 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling. I love democracy... I love the Republic. The fact that this crisis is demanding I be given absolute power to tule over you is evident. But I am mild by nature and have no desire to destroy the democratic process. The power you give me I will lay down when this crisis has abated, I promise you. And all I ask in return is when my current term of office is over, you allow me to reture and live out my life in peace.
sw_L1326 +++$+++ sw_u63 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MAS AMEDDA +++$+++ We shall proceed to the vote. All those in favor of granting emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor, signal ate at this time... those opposed?
sw_L1327 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Hey, where are you going?
sw_L1328 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ To find Obi-Wan.
sw_L1329 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ No! You're not!
sw_L1330 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Let go of me!
sw_L1331 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm not letting you go out there. It's too dangerous.
sw_L1332 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ What?!?
sw_L1333 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ It's my job to protect you. I said it's too dangerous. You're not going, and that's final!
sw_L1334 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Don't you give me orders, Annie! I'm a Senator of the Galactic Republic. You have no authority to contain me, restrain me, or direct me! You remember your place, young man.  Now you can come along and protect me or stay here. It's up to you.
sw_L1335 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  It's empty!
sw_L1336 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Wait!
sw_L1337 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ Senator Amidala, I've heard so much about you.
sw_L1338 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Count Dooku, I assume.
sw_L1339 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ I'm delighted to meet you at last. We have a great deal to discuss, Senator. I hope you can keep your young Jedi under control.
sw_L1340 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Don't worry he's housebroken.
sw_L1341 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi- Wan Kenobi. I am formally requesting you turn him over to me, now.
sw_L1342 +++$+++ sw_u118 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DOOKU +++$+++ He has been convicted of espionage, Senator, and will be executed. In just a few hours, I believe.
sw_L1343 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ He is an officer of the Republic. You can't do that.
sw_L1344 +++$+++ sw_u118 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DOOKU +++$+++ We don't recognise the Republic here, Senator. But if Naboo were to join our Alliance, I could easily hear your plea for clemency.
sw_L1345 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ And if I don't join your rebellion, I assume this Jedi with me will also die?
sw_L1346 +++$+++ sw_u118 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DOOKU +++$+++ I don't wish to make you to join our cause against your will, Senator, but you are a rational, honest representative of your people and I assume you want to do what's in their best interest. Aren't you fed up with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't you? Be honest, Senator.
sw_L1347 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ The ideals are still alive, Count, even if the institution is failing.
sw_L1348 +++$+++ sw_u118 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DOOKU +++$+++ You believe in the same ideals we believe in! The same ideals we are striving to make prominent.
sw_L1349 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ If what you say is true, you should stay in the Republic and help Chancellor Palpatine put things right.
sw_L1350 +++$+++ sw_u118 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DOOKU +++$+++ The Chancellor means well, M'Lady but he is incompetent. He has promised to cut the bureaucracy, but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever, no? Senator, the Republic cannot be fixed. It is time to start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham, a shell game played on the voters. It will not be long before the cult of greed, called the Republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom.
sw_L1351 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I cannot believe that. I will not forsake all I have honoured and worked for and betray the Republic. I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others, Count. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business... it's business becoming government!
sw_L1352 +++$+++ sw_u118 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DOOKU +++$+++ Are you willing to betray your Jedi friends? Without your co-operation I can do nothing to stop their execution.
sw_L1353 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed also?
sw_L1354 +++$+++ sw_u118 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DOOKU +++$+++ I wouldn't think of such an offence. But, there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise, M'lady. It has nothing to do with politics, I'm afraid. It's purely personal, and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. I'm sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions. I'm sorry but if you are not going to co-operate, I must turn you over to the Geonosians for justice. I've done all I can for you.
sw_L1355 +++$+++ sw_u102 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ JANGO FETT +++$+++ I'll take that weapon.
sw_L1356 +++$+++ sw_u118 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DOOKU +++$+++ You may cause a lot of bloodshed, my young Jedi, but you will not escape.
sw_L1357 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Anakin...
sw_L1358 +++$+++ sw_u119 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SUN RIT +++$+++ You have been charged and found guilty of Espionage.
sw_L1359 +++$+++ sw_u120 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ POGGLE +++$+++ Do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out?
sw_L1360 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ You are committing an act of war, Archduke. I hope you are prepared for the consequences.
sw_L1361 +++$+++ sw_u120 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ POGGLE +++$+++ We build weapons, Senator... that is our business! Of course we're prepared!
sw_L1362 +++$+++ sw_u121 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ NUTE GUNRAY +++$+++ Get on with it. Carry out the sentence. I want to see her suffer.
sw_L1363 +++$+++ sw_u120 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ POGGLE +++$+++ Your other Jedi friend is waiting for you, Senator. Take them to the arena!
sw_L1364 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Don't be afraid.
sw_L1365 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.
sw_L1366 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
sw_L1367 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I love you.
sw_L1368 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You love me?! I thought we decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. That it would destroy our lives...
sw_L1369 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. My love for you is a puzzle, Annie, for which I have no answers. I can't control it... and now I don't care. I truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want you to know.
sw_L1370 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I have no desire to be cured of this love either. Long or short, I vow to spend the rest of my life with you.
sw_L1371 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I retransmitted it as you requested, Master. Then we decided to come and rescue you.
sw_L1372 +++$+++ sw_u119 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ SUN RIT +++$+++ The felons before you have been convicted of espionage against the Sovereign System of Geonosis. Their sentence of death is to be carried out in this public arena henceforth.
sw_L1373 +++$+++ sw_u120 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ POGGLE +++$+++ Let the executions begin!
sw_L1374 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I have a bad feeling about this.
sw_L1375 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What about Padme?
sw_L1376 +++$+++ sw_u121 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ NUTE GUNRAY +++$+++ Foul!! She can't do that... shoot her or something!
sw_L1377 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You okay?
sw_L1378 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  Sure! Well, sort of.
sw_L1379 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Jump!!!
sw_L1380 +++$+++ sw_u121 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ NUTE GUNRAY +++$+++ This isn't how it's supposed to be! Jango, finish her off.
sw_L1381 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++  Patiece, Viceroy... she will die. Maybe this is the way it's supposed to end.
sw_L1382 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ Master Windu, how pleasant of you to join us. You're just in time for the moment of truth. I would think these two new boys of yours could use a little more training.
sw_L1383 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku. This party's over.
sw_L1384 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++  Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi friend. You're impossibly outnumbered.
sw_L1385 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ I don't think so. One Jedi has to be worth a hundred Geonosians.
sw_L1386 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ It wasn't the Geonosians I was thinking about. How well do you think one Jedi will hold up against a thousand battle droids?
sw_L1387 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Don't worry! It's being - taken care of!
sw_L1388 +++$+++ sw_u122 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PLO KOON +++$+++ We've done it! Now we have a chance!
sw_L1389 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ Master Windu!
sw_L1390 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++  You have fought gallantly. Worthy of recognition in the history archives of the Jedi Order. Now it is finished. (pauses briefly) Surrender - and your lives will be spared.
sw_L1391 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ We will not be hostages for you to barter with Dooku.
sw_L1392 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You will have to be destroyed.
sw_L1393 +++$+++ sw_u78 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Look!
sw_L1394 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Come on - hurry! Hurry!
sw_L1395 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ More battalions to the left. Encircle them we must, then divide.
sw_L1396 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ It's Dooku, go after him!
sw_L1397 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Padme!!!
sw_L1398 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Put the ship down! Down!
sw_L1399 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ No we're not!! Land this ship!
sw_L1400 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't care!.. Go back.
sw_L1401 +++$+++ sw_u123 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DROID CAPTAIN +++$+++ Your Excellency!
sw_L1402 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ That won't be necessary, Captain. Stand down. And leave them to me.
sw_L1403 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm taking him now!
sw_L1404 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You'll pay for all the Jedi you've killed today, Dooku.
sw_L1405 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now, back down.
sw_L1406 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ Ah, but if I must.
sw_L1407 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++  I have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the Dark Side. It gives me infinitely greater power.
sw_L1408 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ Grand Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem.
sw_L1409 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++  Surely you can do better...? (parries) No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly, or are you trying to make fun of me? (cuts) Which is it?
sw_L1410 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++  come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me out of my misery.
sw_L1411 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++  That's brave of you, boy - but foolish. I would have thought you'd have learnt your lesson.
sw_L1412 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm a slow learner.
sw_L1413 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ You have unusual powers, young Padawan. But not enought to save you this time.
sw_L1414 +++$+++ sw_u73 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Don't bet on it!
sw_L1415 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ Master Yoda. At last we shall know who is the most powerful.
sw_L1416 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Count Dooku. No interest in contests, do I have.
sw_L1417 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++  The end for you, Count, this is.
sw_L1418 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ ...Not yet...
sw_L1419 +++$+++ sw_u60 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ PADMÉ +++$+++ Anakin!
sw_L1420 +++$+++ sw_u124 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ CLONE CAPTAIN +++$+++ Resistance is at an end, General. What are your orders ?
sw_L1421 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ The Force is with us, my Master.
sw_L1422 +++$+++ sw_u125 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have done well.
sw_L1423 +++$+++ sw_u117 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ I bring you good news, my Lord. The war has begun.
sw_L1424 +++$+++ sw_u125 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ Excellent.  Everything is going as planned.
sw_L1425 +++$+++ sw_u68 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ Where is your apprentice?
sw_L1426 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Victory? Victory, you say?
sw_L1427 +++$+++ sw_u69 +++$+++ sw_m1 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++  Not victory, a defeat, it was... Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone War has!
sw_L1428 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . .
sw_L1429 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.
sw_L1430 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.
sw_L1431 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . .
sw_L1432 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  We got him, Artoo!
sw_L1433 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I copy, Artoo.
sw_L1434 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver.
sw_L1435 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!
sw_L1436 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ We're locked on ... we've got him . . .
sw_L1437 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.
sw_L1438 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead.
sw_L1439 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  The one crawling with vulture droids.
sw_L1440 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Come on, Master.
sw_L1441 +++$+++ sw_u127 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ODD BALL +++$+++  Copy, Red Leader.
sw_L1442 +++$+++ sw_u127 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ODD BALL +++$+++ We're on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position.
sw_L1443 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side.
sw_L1444 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm going head to head. See you.
sw_L1445 +++$+++ sw_u127 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ODD BALL +++$+++ I'm on your right, Red Leader.
sw_L1446 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Incoming!!
sw_L1447 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Here we go.
sw_L1448 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Hang on. There are four more of them.
sw_L1449 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.
sw_L1450 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ How many back there. Artoo?  Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that's not good.
sw_L1451 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I know. I know!
sw_L1452 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I know. I know!
sw_L1453 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm going low and left.
sw_L1454 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . .
sw_L1455 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.
sw_L1456 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Wrong thought, Artoo.
sw_L1457 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I'm through.
sw_L1458 +++$+++ sw_u127 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ODD BALL +++$+++ There are too many of them.
sw_L1459 +++$+++ sw_u128 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE PILOT 2 +++$+++ I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . .
sw_L1460 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm going to go help them out!
sw_L1461 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Missiles! Pull up!
sw_L1462 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ They're coming around!
sw_L1463 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.
sw_L1464 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ We got 'em. Artoo!
sw_L1465 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I see them . . . Buzz Droids.
sw_L1466 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
sw_L1467 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Steady . . . steady . . .
sw_L1468 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .
sw_L1469 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Move to the right.
sw_L1470 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm not leaving without you, Master.
sw_L1471 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!
sw_L1472 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yeah, you got him!
sw_L1473 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.
sw_L1474 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Oh?!? Sorry, Master.
sw_L1475 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Tap into the ship's computers.
sw_L1476 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I sense Count Dooku . . .
sw_L1477 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Next move?
sw_L1478 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.
sw_L1479 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ What's the situation, Captain?
sw_L1480 +++$+++ sw_u130 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.
sw_L1481 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Just as Count Dooku predicted.
sw_L1482 +++$+++ sw_u131 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BODYGUARD I +++$+++ General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We've been waiting for you.
sw_L1483 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Ready.
sw_L1484 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Well then, we're safe for the time being.
sw_L1485 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ They're sealing this section off.
sw_L1486 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.
sw_L1487 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I found our escape vent.
sw_L1488 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .
sw_L1489 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Here's a way out.
sw_L1490 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.
sw_L1491 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Destroyers!!
sw_L1492 +++$+++ sw_u132 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BATTLE DROID +++$+++ Drop your weapons! I said drop 'em.
sw_L1493 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ No, did you?
sw_L1494 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Well, there's more than one way out of here.
sw_L1495 +++$+++ sw_u133 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ SUPER BATTLE DROID 1 +++$+++ What's that?
sw_L1496 +++$+++ sw_u134 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ SUPER BATTLE DROID 2 +++$+++ Get back to work. It's nothing.
sw_L1497 +++$+++ sw_u135 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DROID 1 +++$+++ Hands up, Jedi! Don't move.
sw_L1498 +++$+++ sw_u136 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DROID 2 +++$+++ Roger, roger.
sw_L1499 +++$+++ sw_u133 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ SUPER BATTLE DROID 1 +++$+++ There it is again.
sw_L1500 +++$+++ sw_u133 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ SUPER BATTLE DROID 1 +++$+++ Hey you!
sw_L1501 +++$+++ sw_u133 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ SUPER BATTLE DROID 1 +++$+++ You stupid little astro droid!
sw_L1502 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What was that all about?
sw_L1503 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can.
sw_L1504 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ He's trying!
sw_L1505 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Are you all right?
sw_L1506 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  Count Dooku.
sw_L1507 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I was about to say that.
sw_L1508 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.
sw_L1509 +++$+++ sw_u138 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.
sw_L1510 +++$+++ sw_u138 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ I've been looking forward to this.
sw_L1511 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.
sw_L1512 +++$+++ sw_u138 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++ Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.
sw_L1513 +++$+++ sw_u138 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++  Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You'll have to do better.
sw_L1514 +++$+++ sw_u138 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ COUNT DOOKU +++$+++  I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you dont use them.
sw_L1515 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!
sw_L1516 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I shouldn't . . .
sw_L1517 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Do it!!
sw_L1518 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ ... I couldn't stop myself.
sw_L1519 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.
sw_L1520 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.
sw_L1521 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.
sw_L1522 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.
sw_L1523 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.
sw_L1524 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.
sw_L1525 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Leave him, or we'll never make it.
sw_L1526 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ His fate will be the same as ours.
sw_L1527 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Prepare for attack.
sw_L1528 +++$+++ sw_u139 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ All batteries fire! Fire!
sw_L1529 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The elevator's not working,  Artoo . . .
sw_L1530 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  . . . Activate Elevator 3224.
sw_L1531 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!
sw_L1532 +++$+++ sw_u139 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Reverse stabilizers.
sw_L1533 +++$+++ sw_u139 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Magnetize! Magnetize!
sw_L1534 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ We can't wait. Come on, we have to be fast.
sw_L1535 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Fire the emergency booster engines.
sw_L1536 +++$+++ sw_u139 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Leveling out, sir.
sw_L1537 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation.
sw_L1538 +++$+++ sw_u140 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKINN +++$+++ Hold on.
sw_L1539 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!
sw_L1540 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?
sw_L1541 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I agree.
sw_L1542 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ What are we going to do?
sw_L1543 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't know.
sw_L1544 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.
sw_L1545 +++$+++ sw_u141 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BODYGUARD +++$+++ General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328.
sw_L1546 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Activate ray shields.
sw_L1547 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Ray shields!
sw_L1548 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.
sw_L1549 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You're the Master. I'm just a hero.
sw_L1550 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.
sw_L1551 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I say . . . patience.
sw_L1552 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . .
sw_L1553 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  See! No problem.
sw_L1554 +++$+++ sw_u142 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ SUPER BATTLE DROID +++$+++ Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.
sw_L1555 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue.
sw_L1556 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.
sw_L1557 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.
sw_L1558 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .
sw_L1559 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.
sw_L1560 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Artoo.
sw_L1561 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Crush them! Make them suffer!
sw_L1562 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Stay and watch your stations.
sw_L1563 +++$+++ sw_u139 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.
sw_L1564 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Stay on course . . . Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.
sw_L1565 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ You lose, General Kenobi.
sw_L1566 +++$+++ sw_u139 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ The ship is breaking up!
sw_L1567 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ We've run out of time.
sw_L1568 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ The hull is burning up!
sw_L1569 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Time to abandon ship.
sw_L1570 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ All the escape pods have been launched.
sw_L1571 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?
sw_L1572 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.
sw_L1573 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.
sw_L1574 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ We lost something.
sw_L1575 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.
sw_L1576 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What's our speed?
sw_L1577 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Grab that . . . Keep us level.
sw_L1578 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.
sw_L1579 +++$+++ sw_u143 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ FlRESHIP PILOT +++$+++ We'll take you in.
sw_L1580 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ We're coming in too hot.
sw_L1581 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Are you coming, Master?
sw_L1582 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.
sw_L1583 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.
sw_L1584 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .
sw_L1585 +++$+++ sw_u144 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WlNDU +++$+++ Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?
sw_L1586 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.
sw_L1587 +++$+++ sw_u144 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WlNDU +++$+++ General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.
sw_L1588 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.
sw_L1589 +++$+++ sw_u144 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WlNDU +++$+++ Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.
sw_L1590 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.
sw_L1591 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.
sw_L1592 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.
sw_L1593 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.
sw_L1594 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ I'll do everything I can with the Senate.
sw_L1595 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Excuse me.
sw_L1596 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Certainly.
sw_L1597 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.
sw_L1598 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.
sw_L1599 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.
sw_L1600 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.
sw_L1601 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Wait, not here . . .
sw_L1602 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.
sw_L1603 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .
sw_L1604 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.
sw_L1605 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.
sw_L1606 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?
sw_L1607 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I'm just excited to see you.
sw_L1608 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?
sw_L1609 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Nothing . . . nothing . . .
sw_L1610 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You're frightened.  Tell me what's going on!
sw_L1611 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .
sw_L1612 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ . . . Is there someone else?
sw_L1613 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.
sw_L1614 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.
sw_L1615 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.
sw_L1616 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .
sw_L1617 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Something wonderful has happened.
sw_L1618 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.
sw_L1619 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ That's . . . that's wonderful.
sw_L1620 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ What are we going to do?
sw_L1621 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.
sw_L1622 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Good. Where is the Separatist Council?
sw_L1623 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Yes, Lord Sidious.
sw_L1624 +++$+++ sw_u147 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SlDIOUS +++$+++ General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.
sw_L1625 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ It will be done, My Lord.
sw_L1626 +++$+++ sw_u147 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SlDIOUS +++$+++ The end of the war is near, General, and I promise you, victory is assured.
sw_L1627 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ But the loss of Count Dooku?
sw_L1628 +++$+++ sw_u147 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SlDIOUS +++$+++ His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.
sw_L1629 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.
sw_L1630 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.
sw_L1631 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You are so beautiful!
sw_L1632 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ It's only because I'm so in love . . .
sw_L1633 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ No, it's because I'm so in love with you.
sw_L1634 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ So love has blinded you?
sw_L1635 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . .
sw_L1636 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ But it's probably true!
sw_L1637 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I haven't laughed in so long . . .
sw_L1638 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Neither have I.
sw_L1639 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love you. I love you.
sw_L1640 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin??
sw_L1641 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ What's bothering you?
sw_L1642 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Nothing . . .
sw_L1643 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I remember when I gave this to you.
sw_L1644 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?
sw_L1645 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ It was a dream.
sw_L1646 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Bad?
sw_L1647 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.
sw_L1648 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ And?
sw_L1649 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ It was about you.
sw_L1650 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Tell me.
sw_L1651 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ It was only a dream.
sw_L1652 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  You die in childbirth . . .
sw_L1653 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ And the baby?
sw_L1654 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't know.
sw_L1655 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ It was only a dream.
sw_L1656 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ . . . I won't let this one become real, Padme.
sw_L1657 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.
sw_L1658 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I know .
sw_L1659 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?
sw_L1660 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Have you told him anything?
sw_L1661 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.
sw_L1662 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!
sw_L1663 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I won't, Anakin.
sw_L1664 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.
sw_L1665 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .
sw_L1666 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ They are of pain, suffering, death . . .
sw_L1667 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
sw_L1668 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Someone . . .
sw_L1669 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ . . . close to you?
sw_L1670 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yes.
sw_L1671 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
sw_L1672 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.
sw_L1673 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
sw_L1674 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What must I do, Master Yoda?
sw_L1675 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
sw_L1676 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.
sw_L1677 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What's wrong then?
sw_L1678 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.
sw_L1679 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Be careful of what?
sw_L1680 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What for?
sw_L1681 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it?
sw_L1682 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?
sw_L1683 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.
sw_L1684 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?
sw_L1685 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.
sw_L1686 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.
sw_L1687 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.
sw_L1688 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.
sw_L1689 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.
sw_L1690 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Everyone will agree on that.
sw_L1691 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.
sw_L1692 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Of course.
sw_L1693 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I need your help, son.
sw_L1694 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What do you mean?
sw_L1695 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.
sw_L1696 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.
sw_L1697 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.
sw_L1698 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ For what? I don't understand.
sw_L1699 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .
sw_L1700 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.
sw_L1701 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.
sw_L1702 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.
sw_L1703 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.
sw_L1704 +++$+++ sw_u149 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ FANG ZAR +++$+++ When did this happen?
sw_L1705 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ The decree was posted this morning.
sw_L1706 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?
sw_L1707 +++$+++ sw_u150 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MON MOTHMA +++$+++ Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists.
sw_L1708 +++$+++ sw_u151 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GIDDEAN DANU +++$+++ The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day.
sw_L1709 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ We can't let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.
sw_L1710 +++$+++ sw_u152 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ TERR TANEEL +++$+++ What are you suggesting?
sw_L1711 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ I apologize. I didn't mean to sound like a Separatist.
sw_L1712 +++$+++ sw_u150 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MON MOTHMA +++$+++ We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.
sw_L1713 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.
sw_L1714 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.
sw_L1715 +++$+++ sw_u153 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GlDDEAN DANU +++$+++ Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.
sw_L1716 +++$+++ sw_u150 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MON MOTHMA +++$+++ The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.
sw_L1717 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .
sw_L1718 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid.
sw_L1719 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing.
sw_L1720 +++$+++ sw_u150 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MON MOTHMA +++$+++ That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.
sw_L1721 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Agreed.
sw_L1722 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative.
sw_L1723 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.
sw_L1724 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
sw_L1725 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I understand.
sw_L1726 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.
sw_L1727 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?
sw_L1728 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Take a seat, young Skywalker.
sw_L1729 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Forgive me, Master.
sw_L1730 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.
sw_L1731 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ We cannot take ships from the front line.
sw_L1732 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.
sw_L1733 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!
sw_L1734 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.
sw_L1735 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.
sw_L1736 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
sw_L1737 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.
sw_L1738 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!
sw_L1739 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .
sw_L1740 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ That has nothing to do with this.
sw_L1741 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You mean divided loyalties.
sw_L1742 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.
sw_L1743 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.
sw_L1744 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.
sw_L1745 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ And?
sw_L1746 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What situation?
sw_L1747 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!
sw_L1748 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?
sw_L1749 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.
sw_L1750 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.
sw_L1751 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?
sw_L1752 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.
sw_L1753 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.
sw_L1754 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ So the prophecy says.
sw_L1755 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.
sw_L1756 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.
sw_L1757 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Thank you, Captain.
sw_L1758 +++$+++ sw_u155 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYPHO +++$+++ Rest well. My Lady.
sw_L1759 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I'll be up in a while.
sw_L1760 +++$+++ sw_u156 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MOTEE +++$+++ Yes, my lady.
sw_L1761 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.
sw_L1762 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Beautiful, isn't it?
sw_L1763 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You startled me.
sw_L1764 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ How are you feeling?
sw_L1765 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ He keeps kicking.
sw_L1766 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ He?! Why do you think it's a boy?
sw_L1767 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  My motherly intuition.
sw_L1768 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.
sw_L1769 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.
sw_L1770 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.
sw_L1771 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.
sw_L1772 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.
sw_L1773 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin . . .
sw_L1774 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
sw_L1775 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?
sw_L1776 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  What do you mean?
sw_L1777 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?
sw_L1778 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!
sw_L1779 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.
sw_L1780 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!
sw_L1781 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ What is it?
sw_L1782 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Nothing.
sw_L1783 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.
sw_L1784 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.
sw_L1785 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.
sw_L1786 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I sense there are things you are not telling me.
sw_L1787 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.
sw_L1788 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
sw_L1789 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.
sw_L1790 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.
sw_L1791 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far  but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.
sw_L1792 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ They try.
sw_L1793 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Sit down,  Leave us.
sw_L1794 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.
sw_L1795 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm not sure I understand.
sw_L1796 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.
sw_L1797 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't think . . .
sw_L1798 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?
sw_L1799 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I know they don't trust you . . .
sw_L1800 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.
sw_L1801 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.
sw_L1802 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?
sw_L1803 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?
sw_L1804 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't know ... I don't know what to say.
sw_L1805 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi.
sw_L1806 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The Jedi use their power for good.
sw_L1807 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .
sw_L1808 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ . . . evil.
sw_L1809 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.
sw_L1810 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.
sw_L1811 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ And the Jedi don't?
sw_L1812 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.
sw_L1813 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?
sw_L1814 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm not sure it's wrong.
sw_L1815 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.
sw_L1816 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?
sw_L1817 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ No.
sw_L1818 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
sw_L1819 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ He could actually save people from death?
sw_L1820 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
sw_L1821 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What happened to him?
sw_L1822 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.  Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.
sw_L1823 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Is it possible to learn this power?
sw_L1824 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Not from a Jedi.
sw_L1825 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++  How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.
sw_L1826 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.
sw_L1827 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
sw_L1828 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.
sw_L1829 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++  The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.
sw_L1830 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ A Master is needed, with more experience.
sw_L1831 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.
sw_L1832 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.
sw_L1833 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.
sw_L1834 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Obi-Wan, my choice is.
sw_L1835 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ I agree.
sw_L1836 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Very well. Council is adjourned.
sw_L1837 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++  Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true, there's no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.
sw_L1838 +++$+++ sw_u157 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE COMMANDER GREE +++$+++ The droids have started up their main power generators.
sw_L1839 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Then now the time is, Commander.
sw_L1840 +++$+++ sw_u157 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE COMMANDER GREE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
sw_L1841 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.
sw_L1842 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?
sw_L1843 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You're not very good at hiding your feelings.
sw_L1844 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Why would he talk to me about his work?
sw_L1845 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Don't give me that look.
sw_L1846 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  What did he say?
sw_L1847 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
sw_L1848 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Thank you, Obi-Wan.
sw_L1849 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ We cannot let this turn into another war.
sw_L1850 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.
sw_L1851 +++$+++ sw_u150 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MON MOTHMA +++$+++ We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all.
sw_L1852 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.
sw_L1853 +++$+++ sw_u158 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BANA BREEMU +++$+++ That would be dangerous.
sw_L1854 +++$+++ sw_u150 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MON MOTHMA +++$+++ We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.
sw_L1855 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.
sw_L1856 +++$+++ sw_u159 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GiDDEAN DANU +++$+++ Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.
sw_L1857 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .
sw_L1858 +++$+++ sw_u160 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CHI EEKWAY +++$+++ Patience, Senator.
sw_L1859 +++$+++ sw_u149 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ FANG ZAR +++$+++ We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.
sw_L1860 +++$+++ sw_u158 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BANA BREEMU +++$+++ When you present the "petition of the two thousand" to the Chancellor, things may change.
sw_L1861 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we include the Jedi.
sw_L1862 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You're going to need me on this one, Master.
sw_L1863 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Master!
sw_L1864 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.
sw_L1865 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Well, there's always a first time.
sw_L1866 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.
sw_L1867 +++$+++ sw_u161 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE COMMANDER CODY +++$+++ Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.
sw_L1868 +++$+++ sw_u161 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE COMMANDER CODY +++$+++ Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?
sw_L1869 +++$+++ sw_u161 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE COMMANDER CODY +++$+++ That was Anakin who was late. I believe.
sw_L1870 +++$+++ sw_u161 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE COMMANDER CODY +++$+++ I'm counting on you.
sw_L1871 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?
sw_L1872 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ He will soon have Grievous's head.
sw_L1873 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.
sw_L1874 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The Council was very sure in its decision.
sw_L1875 +++$+++ sw_u162 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .
sw_L1876 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Hi, Jar Jar.
sw_L1877 +++$+++ sw_u162 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ JAR JAR +++$+++ Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.
sw_L1878 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.
sw_L1879 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Not fit? Why would anyone think that?
sw_L1880 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.
sw_L1881 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ That's ridiculous. Who?!?
sw_L1882 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.
sw_L1883 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ That's impossible. I would know.
sw_L1884 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.
sw_L1885 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.
sw_L1886 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I can't!
sw_L1887 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?
sw_L1888 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ He came by this morning.
sw_L1889 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What did he want?
sw_L1890 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ He's worried about you.
sw_L1891 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You told him about us, didn't you?
sw_L1892 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.
sw_L1893 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ And he's not?
sw_L1894 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You have been moody lately.
sw_L1895 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm not moody . . .
sw_L1896 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin! Don't do this again.
sw_L1897 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.
sw_L1898 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.
sw_L1899 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.
sw_L1900 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.
sw_L1901 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't.
sw_L1902 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You expect too much of yourself.
sw_L1903 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I have found a way to save you.
sw_L1904 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Save me?
sw_L1905 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ From my nightmares.
sw_L1906 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Is that what's bothering you?
sw_L1907 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I won't lose you, Padme.
sw_L1908 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.
sw_L1909 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.
sw_L1910 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You don't need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are.
sw_L1911 +++$+++ sw_u163 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ TlON MEDON +++$+++ Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?
sw_L1912 +++$+++ sw_u163 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ TlON MEDON +++$+++ There is no war here unless you've brought it with you.
sw_L1913 +++$+++ sw_u163 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ TlON MEDON +++$+++ He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.
sw_L1914 +++$+++ sw_u163 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ TlON MEDON +++$+++ The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .
sw_L1915 +++$+++ sw_u163 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ TlON MEDON +++$+++ I told you, all he wanted was fuel.
sw_L1916 +++$+++ sw_u141 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BODYGUARD +++$+++ What was his name?
sw_L1917 +++$+++ sw_u163 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ TlON MEDON +++$+++ He didn't say.
sw_L1918 +++$+++ sw_u164 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ WRANGLER +++$+++  You need transportation.
sw_L1919 +++$+++ sw_u164 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ WRANGLER +++$+++  I will get it for you.
sw_L1920 +++$+++ sw_u164 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ WRANGLER +++$+++ Boga. She answers to Boga.
sw_L1921 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.
sw_L1922 +++$+++ sw_u165 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ NUTE GUNRAY +++$+++ Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.
sw_L1923 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting.
sw_L1924 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you're doomed,  Kill him!
sw_L1925 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Enough of this.
sw_L1926 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.
sw_L1927 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.
sw_L1928 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.
sw_L1929 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.
sw_L1930 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?
sw_L1931 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .
sw_L1932 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.
sw_L1933 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.
sw_L1934 +++$+++ sw_u166 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ FANGZAR +++$+++ But surely . . .
sw_L1935 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.
sw_L1936 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, Chancellor.
sw_L1937 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.
sw_L1938 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.
sw_L1939 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What do you mean?
sw_L1940 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ They are not to be trusted.
sw_L1941 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .
sw_L1942 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.
sw_L1943 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm sure you're mistaken.
sw_L1944 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.
sw_L1945 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.
sw_L1946 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.
sw_L1947 +++$+++ sw_u161 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE COMMANDER CODY +++$+++ Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we have begun our attack.
sw_L1948 +++$+++ sw_u144 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WlNDU +++$+++ Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions.
sw_L1949 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yes, Master.
sw_L1950 +++$+++ sw_u167 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.
sw_L1951 +++$+++ sw_u168 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WiNDU +++$+++ That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .
sw_L1952 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.
sw_L1953 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.
sw_L1954 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.
sw_L1955 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I should be there with him.
sw_L1956 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?
sw_L1957 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.
sw_L1958 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.
sw_L1959 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ How do you know the ways of the Force?
sw_L1960 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.
sw_L1961 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You know the dark side?!?
sw_L1962 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.  They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.
sw_L1963 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.
sw_L1964 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.
sw_L1965 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What did you say?
sw_L1966 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .
sw_L1967 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You're a Sith Lord!
sw_L1968 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.
sw_L1969 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You're wrong!
sw_L1970 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Are you going to kill me?
sw_L1971 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I would certainly like to.
sw_L1972 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.
sw_L1973 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
sw_L1974 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?
sw_L1975 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I will quickly discover the truth of all this.
sw_L1976 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.
sw_L1977 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate. Perhaps you'll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all . . .
sw_L1978 +++$+++ sw_u129 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GENERAL GRIEVOUS +++$+++ Prepare to move out of orbit. I will be up in a few moments.
sw_L1979 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Master Windu, I must talk to you.
sw_L1980 +++$+++ sw_u168 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WiNDU +++$+++ What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.
sw_L1981 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.
sw_L1982 +++$+++ sw_u167 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ A Sith Lord?
sw_L1983 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yes. The one we have been looking for.
sw_L1984 +++$+++ sw_u168 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WiNDU +++$+++ How do you know this?
sw_L1985 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.
sw_L1986 +++$+++ sw_u168 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WiNDU +++$+++ Are you sure?
sw_L1987 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Absolutely.
sw_L1988 +++$+++ sw_u168 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WiNDU +++$+++ Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.
sw_L1989 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.
sw_L1990 +++$+++ sw_u168 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WiNDU +++$+++ For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.
sw_L1991 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I must go, Master.
sw_L1992 +++$+++ sw_u168 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WiNDU +++$+++ No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.
sw_L1993 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yes, Master.
sw_L1994 +++$+++ sw_u168 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WiNDU +++$+++ Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.
sw_L1995 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yes, Master.
sw_L1996 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.
sw_L1997 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.
sw_L1998 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I can't do this ... I can't let her die.
sw_L1999 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.
sw_L2000 +++$+++ sw_u167 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.
sw_L2001 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?
sw_L2002 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ The Senate will decide your fate.
sw_L2003 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  I am the Senate!
sw_L2004 +++$+++ sw_u154 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Not yet!
sw_L2005 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ It's treason, then.
sw_L2006 +++$+++ sw_u167 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WINDU +++$+++ You are under arrest, My Lord.
sw_L2007 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.
sw_L2008 +++$+++ sw_u144 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WlNDU +++$+++ You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Republic is over . . . you have lost . . .
sw_L2009 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ No! No! You will die!
sw_L2010 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ He is a traitor, Anakin.
sw_L2011 +++$+++ sw_u144 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WlNDU +++$+++ He's the traitor. Stop him!
sw_L2012 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.
sw_L2013 +++$+++ sw_u144 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WlNDU +++$+++ Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .
sw_L2014 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ You are not one of them, Anakin. Don't let him kill me.
sw_L2015 +++$+++ sw_u144 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WlNDU +++$+++ Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .
sw_L2016 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.
sw_L2017 +++$+++ sw_u144 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WlNDU +++$+++ Don't listen to him, Anakin.
sw_L2018 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Help me! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .
sw_L2019 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I can't ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don't kill me. I give up. I'm dying. I can't hold on any longer.
sw_L2020 +++$+++ sw_u144 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WlNDU +++$+++ You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.
sw_L2021 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial.
sw_L2022 +++$+++ sw_u144 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MACE WlNDU +++$+++ He has too much control of the Senate and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.
sw_L2023 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.
sw_L2024 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ It is not the Jedi way . . .
sw_L2025 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  He must live . . .
sw_L2026 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Please don't, please don't . . .
sw_L2027 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I need him . . .
sw_L2028 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Please don't . . .
sw_L2029 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ NO!!!
sw_L2030 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Power! Unlimited power!
sw_L2031 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What have I done?
sw_L2032 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.
sw_L2033 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I will do whatever you ask.
sw_L2034 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Good.
sw_L2035 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death.
sw_L2036 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.
sw_L2037 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.
sw_L2038 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader.
sw_L2039 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Thank you. my Master.
sw_L2040 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Rise, Darth Vader.
sw_L2041 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.
sw_L2042 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the Senate.
sw_L2043 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don't you?
sw_L2044 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I understand, Master.
sw_L2045 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.
sw_L2046 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?
sw_L2047 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.
sw_L2048 +++$+++ sw_u161 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE COMMANDER CODY +++$+++ Very good, sir.
sw_L2049 +++$+++ sw_u161 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE COMMANDER CODY +++$+++  Oh, by the way, I think you'll be needing this.
sw_L2050 +++$+++ sw_u161 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE COMMANDER CODY +++$+++ Yes, sir!
sw_L2051 +++$+++ sw_u147 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SlDIOUS +++$+++ Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.
sw_L2052 +++$+++ sw_u161 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE COMMANDER CODY +++$+++ It will be done, My Lord.
sw_L2053 +++$+++ sw_u161 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE COMMANDER CODY +++$+++ Blast him!
sw_L2054 +++$+++ sw_u147 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SlDIOUS +++$+++ Commander 1138 . . .
sw_L2055 +++$+++ sw_u147 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SlDIOUS +++$+++ The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.
sw_L2056 +++$+++ sw_u169 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ AAYLA +++$+++ Steady. . . . steady . . .
sw_L2057 +++$+++ sw_u169 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ AAYLA +++$+++  Bly, do you think they're Droids?
sw_L2058 +++$+++ sw_u170 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BLY +++$+++ No.
sw_L2059 +++$+++ sw_u171 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ Execute Order Sixty-Six.
sw_L2060 +++$+++ sw_u172 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE PILOT +++$+++ It will be done, My Lord.
sw_L2061 +++$+++ sw_u173 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PLO KOON +++$+++ There they are. Land on the nearest platform.
sw_L2062 +++$+++ sw_u157 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE COMMANDER GREE +++$+++ Yes, My Lord.
sw_L2063 +++$+++ sw_u174 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DABTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.
sw_L2064 +++$+++ sw_u157 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE COMMANDER GREE +++$+++ It will be done, My Lord.
sw_L2065 +++$+++ sw_u175 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YOUNGLINGS +++$+++ Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?
sw_L2066 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ What's going on here?!?
sw_L2067 +++$+++ sw_u176 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE SERGEANT +++$+++ There's been a rebellion. Don't worry, sir, the situation is under control.
sw_L2068 +++$+++ sw_u176 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE SERGEANT +++$+++  I'm sorry, sir. No one is allowed entry.
sw_L2069 +++$+++ sw_u176 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE SERGEANT +++$+++  It's time for you to leave, sir.
sw_L2070 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ And so it is.
sw_L2071 +++$+++ sw_u177 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE COMMANDER APPO +++$+++ Get him! Shoot him!
sw_L2072 +++$+++ sw_u178 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee.  CLONE SERGEANT: Did you find something?
sw_L2073 +++$+++ sw_u178 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ It's nothing, nothing.  CLONE SERGEANT: It's nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.
sw_L2074 +++$+++ sw_u179 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE TROOPER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
sw_L2075 +++$+++ sw_u178 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be.
sw_L2076 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.
sw_L2077 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++  Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .
sw_L2078 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.
sw_L2079 +++$+++ sw_u180 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ROYAL GUARD +++$+++ Identification . . .
sw_L2080 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan.
sw_L2081 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Were you able to get hold of a Jedi homing beacon?
sw_L2082 +++$+++ sw_u181 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CAPTAIN ANTILLES +++$+++ Yes, sir. We've encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command.
sw_L2083 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.
sw_L2084 +++$+++ sw_u182 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE CAPTAIN +++$+++ Did you find Kenobi?
sw_L2085 +++$+++ sw_u179 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE TROOPER +++$+++ No one could have survived that fall.
sw_L2086 +++$+++ sw_u182 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE CAPTAIN +++$+++ Start loading your men on the ship.
sw_L2087 +++$+++ sw_u179 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE TROOPER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
sw_L2088 +++$+++ sw_u183 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL +++$+++  . . . Kenobi . . .
sw_L2089 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Master Kenobi??
sw_L2090 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We're sending you our coordinates.
sw_L2091 +++$+++ sw_u184 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Hush! Not so loud!
sw_L2092 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.
sw_L2093 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
sw_L2094 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?
sw_L2095 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .
sw_L2096 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I can't believe that!
sw_L2097 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.
sw_L2098 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin, what are you going to do?
sw_L2099 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.
sw_L2100 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ What about Obi-Wan?
sw_L2101 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.
sw_L2102 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ How could this have happened?
sw_L2103 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.
sw_L2104 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ What are you saying?
sw_L2105 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.
sw_L2106 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?
sw_L2107 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ That won't happen. I won't let it.
sw_L2108 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.
sw_L2109 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise.
sw_L2110 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Please, wait for me.
sw_L2111 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I will.
sw_L2112 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ No thank you, Threepio.
sw_L2113 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ No.
sw_L2114 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ You made it.
sw_L2115 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.
sw_L2116 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.
sw_L2117 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Heard from no one, have we.
sw_L2118 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda.
sw_L2119 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Received a coded retreat message, we have.
sw_L2120 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over . . .
sw_L2121 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ It's too dangerous to return.
sw_L2122 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
sw_L2123 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.
sw_L2124 +++$+++ sw_u165 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ NUTE GUNRAY +++$+++ The plan has gone as you had promised, My Lord.
sw_L2125 +++$+++ sw_u171 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice, Darth Vader, arrives, he will take care of you.
sw_L2126 +++$+++ sw_u139 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ We are receiving a message from the Chancellor's office, sir.
sw_L2127 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Send it through.
sw_L2128 +++$+++ sw_u139 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Yes, sir.
sw_L2129 +++$+++ sw_u185 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MAS AMEDDA +++$+++ Senator Organa . . . the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session of Congress.
sw_L2130 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Tell the Chancellor I will be there.
sw_L2131 +++$+++ sw_u185 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MAS AMEDDA +++$+++ Very well. He will be expecting you.
sw_L2132 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ It could be a trap.
sw_L2133 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.
sw_L2134 +++$+++ sw_u186 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Welcome back, Senator. May I see your clearance?
sw_L2135 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Certainly.
sw_L2136 +++$+++ sw_u186 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Thank you, you may proceed. We will take custody of the Jedi.
sw_L2137 +++$+++ sw_u186 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ It would be better if they stayed with you.
sw_L2138 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Artoo . . . stay with the ship.
sw_L2139 +++$+++ sw_u165 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ NUTE GUNRAY +++$+++ Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you.
sw_L2140 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.
sw_L2141 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ . . . and the Jedi Rebellion has been foiled.
sw_L2142 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ I was held up. What's happening?
sw_L2143 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi, to overthrow the Senate.
sw_L2144 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ That's not true!
sw_L2145 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ He's been presenting evidence all afternoon.
sw_L2146 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ And the Senate will go along with it, just like they always do.
sw_L2147 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated.  Any collaborators will suffer the same fate.
sw_L2148 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.
sw_L2149 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger.
sw_L2150 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ The war is over.  The Separatists have been defeated, (applause) and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning.
sw_L2151 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the Republic to a democracy.
sw_L2152 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.
sw_L2153 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . .
sw_L2154 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new constitution . . .
sw_L2155 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . .
sw_L2156 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ We cannot let this happen.
sw_L2157 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Not now! There will be a time.
sw_L2158 +++$+++ sw_u187 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ RUNE HAAKO +++$+++ Stop! Enough, this is not right!
sw_L2159 +++$+++ sw_u165 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ NUTE GUNRAY +++$+++ The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace ... we only want . . .
sw_L2160 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.
sw_L2161 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
sw_L2162 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.
sw_L2163 +++$+++ sw_u147 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SlDIOUS +++$+++ Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing?
sw_L2164 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Yes, My Master.
sw_L2165 +++$+++ sw_u147 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SlDIOUS +++$+++ Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire.
sw_L2166 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Destroy the Sith, we must.
sw_L2167 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.
sw_L2168 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.
sw_L2169 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ To question, no time there is.
sw_L2170 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.
sw_L2171 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Master Kenobi . . .
sw_L2172 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you're alive.
sw_L2173 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our lives is gone.
sw_L2174 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.
sw_L2175 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ The Sith!?!
sw_L2176 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Yesterday.
sw_L2177 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  No.
sw_L2178 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ From the Sith?
sw_L2179 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You're wrong! How could you even say that?
sw_L2180 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Not Anakin! He couldn't!
sw_L2181 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I don't believe you ... I can't.
sw_L2182 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ You're going to kill him, aren't you?
sw_L2183 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I can't . . .
sw_L2184 +++$+++ sw_u155 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYPHO +++$+++ My Lady, let me come with you.
sw_L2185 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal.
sw_L2186 +++$+++ sw_u155 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CAPTAIN TYPHO +++$+++ As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree.
sw_L2187 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I'll be all right, Captain.
sw_L2188 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++  This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.
sw_L2189 +++$+++ sw_u188 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH VADER +++$+++ The Separatists are taken care of, My Master.
sw_L2190 +++$+++ sw_u147 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SlDIOUS +++$+++ It is finished, then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy. You have done well, Lord Vader.
sw_L2191 +++$+++ sw_u188 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH VADER +++$+++ Thank you, My Master.
sw_L2192 +++$+++ sw_u147 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SlDIOUS +++$+++ Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. Tell them the Separatist leaders have been wiped out. Grievous and Dooku have been destroyed. All droid units must shut down immediately.
sw_L2193 +++$+++ sw_u188 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH VADER +++$+++ Very good, My Lord.
sw_L2194 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Padme, I saw your ship . . .
sw_L2195 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Oh, Anakin!
sw_L2196 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?
sw_L2197 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
sw_L2198 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What things?
sw_L2199 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.
sw_L2200 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
sw_L2201 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ He cares about us.
sw_L2202 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Us??!
sw_L2203 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ He knows . . . He wants to help you.
sw_L2204 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough.
sw_L2205 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Anakin, all I want is your love.
sw_L2206 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.
sw_L2207 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.
sw_L2208 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.
sw_L2209 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.
sw_L2210 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.
sw_L2211 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.
sw_L2212 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.
sw_L2213 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I can't follow.
sw_L2214 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Because of Obi-Wan?
sw_L2215 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.
sw_L2216 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++  Liar!
sw_L2217 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ No!
sw_L2218 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!
sw_L2219 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...
sw_L2220 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ What have you and she been up to?
sw_L2221 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You turned her against me.
sw_L2222 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You will not take her from me.
sw_L2223 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.
sw_L2224 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Don't make me kill you.
sw_L2225 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ If you're not with me, you're my enemy.
sw_L2226 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You will try.
sw_L2227 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.
sw_L2228 +++$+++ sw_u147 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SlDIOUS +++$+++ Master Yoda, you survived.
sw_L2229 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Surprised?
sw_L2230 +++$+++ sw_u147 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SlDIOUS +++$+++ Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience the full power of the dark side.
sw_L2231 +++$+++ sw_u147 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SlDIOUS +++$+++ I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At last, the Jedi are no more.
sw_L2232 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious.
sw_L2233 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++  At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.
sw_L2234 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++  If so powerful you are, why leave??
sw_L2235 +++$+++ sw_u147 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SlDIOUS +++$+++ You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.
sw_L2236 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
sw_L2237 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ Don't make me destroy you, Master. You're no match for the dark side.
sw_L2238 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion.
sw_L2239 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy.
sw_L2240 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Hurry. Careful timing we will need.
sw_L2241 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++  There aren't many troops on this side. Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.
sw_L2242 +++$+++ sw_u185 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MAS AMEDDA +++$+++ Then he is not dead.
sw_L2243 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ Double your search.
sw_L2244 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++  Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff.
sw_L2245 +++$+++ sw_u185 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MAS AMEDDA +++$+++ Yes, Master.
sw_L2246 +++$+++ sw_u137 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PALPATINE +++$+++ I sense Lord Vader is in danger.
sw_L2247 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.
sw_L2248 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .
sw_L2249 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.
sw_L2250 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.
sw_L2251 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ You underestimate my power!
sw_L2252 +++$+++ sw_u126 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ ANAKIN +++$+++ I hate you!
sw_L2253 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?
sw_L2254 +++$+++ sw_u171 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He's still alive. Get a medical capsule, immediately.
sw_L2255 +++$+++ sw_u182 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CLONE CAPTAIN +++$+++ Yes sir. Right away.
sw_L2256 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ...
sw_L2257 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Eternal consciousness.
sw_L2258 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.
sw_L2259 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.
sw_L2260 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.
sw_L2261 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ We'll take her to the medical center, quickly.
sw_L2262 +++$+++ sw_u189 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MEDICAL DROID +++$+++ Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.
sw_L2263 +++$+++ sw_u189 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MEDICAL DROID +++$+++ We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.
sw_L2264 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Babies??!!
sw_L2265 +++$+++ sw_u189 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MEDICAL DROID +++$+++ She's carrying twins.
sw_L2266 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Save them, we must. They are our last hope.
sw_L2267 +++$+++ sw_u189 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MEDICAL DROID +++$+++ It's a boy.
sw_L2268 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Luke . . .
sw_L2269 +++$+++ sw_u189 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MEDICAL DROID +++$+++ ... and a girl.
sw_L2270 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ . . . Leia.
sw_L2271 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ I can't . . .
sw_L2272 +++$+++ sw_u146 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ PADME +++$+++ Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .
sw_L2273 +++$+++ sw_u189 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ MEDICAL DROID +++$+++ My Lord, the construction is finished ... he lives.
sw_L2274 +++$+++ sw_u171 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ Good. Good.
sw_L2275 +++$+++ sw_u171 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++  Lord Vader, can you hear me?
sw_L2276 +++$+++ sw_u188 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH VADER +++$+++ Yes, My Master.
sw_L2277 +++$+++ sw_u188 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH VADER +++$+++  Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?
sw_L2278 +++$+++ sw_u171 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH SIDIOUS +++$+++ I'm afraid she died. ... it seems in your anger, you killed her.
sw_L2279 +++$+++ sw_u188 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ DARTH VADER +++$+++ I couldn't have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It's impossible! No!!!
sw_L2280 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.
sw_L2281 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Split up, they should be.
sw_L2282 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.
sw_L2283 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ To Tatooine. To his family, send him.
sw_L2284 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will.
sw_L2285 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++  Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.
sw_L2286 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
sw_L2287 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
sw_L2288 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.
sw_L2289 +++$+++ sw_u148 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps.
sw_L2290 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ Captain Antilles.
sw_L2291 +++$+++ sw_u181 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ CAPTAIN ANTILLES +++$+++ Yes, Your Highness.
sw_L2292 +++$+++ sw_u145 +++$+++ sw_m2 +++$+++ BAIL ORGANA +++$+++ I'm placing these droids in your care. Treat them well. Clean them up. Have the Protocol Droid's mind wiped.
sw_L2293 +++$+++ sw_u190 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ EPISODE VII +++$+++ 
sw_L2294 +++$+++ sw_u191 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ THE FORCE AWAKENS +++$+++    Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence, the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the ashes of the Empire and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed. With the support of the REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is desperate to find her brother Luke and gain his help in restoring peace and justice to the galaxy.  Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret mission to Jakku, where an old ally has discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts....   PAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen -- HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE... 
sw_L2295 +++$+++ sw_u192 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LOR SAN TEKKA +++$+++ This will begin to make things right. I've traveled too far, and seen too much, to ignore the despair in the galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force. 
sw_L2296 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Well, because of you now we have a chance. The General's been after this for a long time. 
sw_L2297 +++$+++ sw_u192 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LOR SAN TEKKA +++$+++ "The General." To me, she's royalty. Well, she certainly is that. 
sw_L2298 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San Tekka. 
sw_L2299 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ You have to hide. 
sw_L2300 +++$+++ sw_u192 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LOR SAN TEKKA +++$+++ You have to leave. Go! Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off. BB-8 follows. 
sw_L2301 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Come on, BB-8! Hurry! Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES 
sw_L2302 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ You take this. It's safer with you than it is with me. You get as far away from here as you can. Do you hear me?  I'll come back for you! It will be alright.     BB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers from cover. 
sw_L2303 +++$+++ sw_u194 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SENIOR TROOPER +++$+++ Stay here. Our Trooper nods. Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE. 
sw_L2304 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Look how old you've become. 
sw_L2305 +++$+++ sw_u192 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LOR SAN TEKKA +++$+++ Something far worse has happened to you. Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other stormtroopers. 
sw_L2306 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ You know what I've come for.     
sw_L2307 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ The map to Skywalker. We know you've found it, and now you're going to give it to the First Order. Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San Tekka exchange continue. 
sw_L2308 +++$+++ sw_u192 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LOR SAN TEKKA +++$+++ The First Order rose from the dark side... you did not. 
sw_L2309 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ I'll show you the dark side. 
sw_L2310 +++$+++ sw_u192 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LOR SAN TEKKA +++$+++ You may try, but you cannot deny the truth that is your family. Suddenly Kylo Ren raises his LIGHTSABER -- IGNITES IT -- 
sw_L2311 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ You're so right. And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA! Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES AT KYLO REN! Instantly: Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLT 
sw_L2312 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ So who talks first? You talk first? 
sw_L2313 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ The old man gave it to you. 
sw_L2314 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ 
sw_L2315 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ 
sw_L2316 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ ... Apparatus. The Troopers roughly pull Poe away. A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer. Poe just glares as the pat down ends. 
sw_L2317 +++$+++ sw_u196 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER #1 +++$+++ Nothing, sir. 
sw_L2318 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Put him on board. Kylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up Villagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACK- 
sw_L2319 +++$+++ sw_u197 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ CAPTAIN PHASMA +++$+++ Sir, the villagers. 
sw_L2320 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Kill them all. Phasma nods, steps forward: 
sw_L2321 +++$+++ sw_u197 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ CAPTAIN PHASMA +++$+++ On my command! The Troopers, including OURS, aim at the Villagers. 
sw_L2322 +++$+++ sw_u198 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER #2 +++$+++ Nothing here. Go ahead! Three other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing -- destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION. 
sw_L2323 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ All right. All right! Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast: 
sw_L2324 +++$+++ sw_u197 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ CAPTAIN PHASMA +++$+++ FN-2187. Submit your blaster for inspection. 
sw_L2325 +++$+++ sw_u197 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ CAPTAIN PHASMA +++$+++ And who gave you permission to remove that helmet? 
sw_L2326 +++$+++ sw_u197 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ CAPTAIN PHASMA +++$+++ Report to my division at once.     
sw_L2327 +++$+++ sw_u199 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ UNKAR +++$+++ What you've brought me today is worth... Hmmm... One quarter portion. Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks. Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET: DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another. She takes it. She swallows her resentment and heads off. 
sw_L2328 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Tal'ama parqual! The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her. 
sw_L2329 +++$+++ sw_u201 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ STRAIGHTENS THE +++$+++ 
sw_L2330 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. Comfortable? Through battered lips: 
sw_L2331 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Not really. 
sw_L2332 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ I'm impressed. No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map. 
sw_L2333 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Might wanna rethink your technique. Kylo Ren says nothing, reaches out to him. Poe flinches in the chair as Kylo Ren reaches for his face, not touching him. Poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence -- 
sw_L2334 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Where is it?     
sw_L2335 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ The Resistance will not be intimidated by you. 
sw_L2336 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Where... is it? Poe can't take it -- he BEGINS TO SCREAM and we CUT TO: 
sw_L2337 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ It's in a droid. A BB unit. 
sw_L2338 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it. 
sw_L2339 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ I leave that to you. 
sw_L2340 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Don't give up. He still might show up. Whoever it is you're waiting for. Classified. I know all about waiting. BB-8 BEEPTALKS a question. 
sw_L2341 +++$+++ sw_u199 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ UNKAR +++$+++ These five pieces are worth... Let me see here... One half portion. 
sw_L2342 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ 
sw_L2343 +++$+++ sw_u199 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ UNKAR +++$+++ What about the droid? 
sw_L2344 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ What about him? 
sw_L2345 +++$+++ sw_u199 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ UNKAR +++$+++ I'll pay for him. BB-8 doesn't like this at all. Rey is awkward, but curious. 
sw_L2346 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Actually... the droid's not for sale. 
sw_L2347 +++$+++ sw_u199 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ UNKAR +++$+++ Follow the girl and get that droid. He SLAMS the service window door SHUT. 
sw_L2348 +++$+++ sw_u203 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER +++$+++ Ren wants the prisoner. TIGHT ON POE, in pain, drained, as the Guard unshackles him. 
sw_L2349 +++$+++ sw_u203 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER +++$+++ Turn here. Poe turns into a narrow passageway -- 
sw_L2350 +++$+++ sw_u203 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER +++$+++ Listen carefully: you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here. 
sw_L2351 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ 
sw_L2352 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ You with the Resistance--?! 
sw_L2353 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ I can fly anything. Why, why are you helping me? 
sw_L2354 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++  You need a pilot. 
sw_L2355 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ We're gonna do this. 
sw_L2356 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ I am calm.     
sw_L2357 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ I always wanted to fly one of these things. Can ya shoot? 
sw_L2358 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Okay, same principal! Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons, and mag pulse -- use the site on the right to aim, triggers to fire! 
sw_L2359 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ I can fix this. 
sw_L2360 +++$+++ sw_u204 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FIRST ORDER COLONEL +++$+++ Alert General Hux and stop that fighter. 
sw_L2361 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ I got it! 
sw_L2362 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Woooahhh! This thing really moves. All right, we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far! 
sw_L2363 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ I'm gonna get us in position, just stay sharp! 
sw_L2364 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it? I've got us dead centered. It's a clean shot. 
sw_L2365 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ I saw it! Hey, what's your name? 
sw_L2366 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ FN-whaa? 
sw_L2367 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Well I ain't using it! FN, huh? Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn! That all right? Even in the madness, Finn can't suppress his smile. 
sw_L2368 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ "Finn." Yeah, "Finn", I like that! I like that! 
sw_L2369 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ I'm Poe. Poe Dameron. 
sw_L2370 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Good to meet you, Poe! 
sw_L2371 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Good to meet you too, Finn! 
sw_L2372 +++$+++ sw_u206 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT MITAKA +++$+++ Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers-- 
sw_L2373 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ Use the ventral cannons.     
sw_L2374 +++$+++ sw_u206 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT MITAKA +++$+++ Yes, sir. Bringing them online -- 
sw_L2375 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ Yes, and he had help. 
sw_L2376 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ ... The one from the village. FN- 
sw_L2377 +++$+++ sw_u206 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT MITAKA +++$+++ Sir. Ventral cannons hot. 
sw_L2378 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ Fire. 
sw_L2379 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ One's coming towards you. My right, your left. Do you see it? 
sw_L2380 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Hold on! I see it! 
sw_L2381 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Nice shot. Finn looks up suddenly in alarm -- 
sw_L2382 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Where are you going?     
sw_L2383 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ We're going back to Jakku. That's where. 
sw_L2384 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system! NEAR-MISS LASER BLASTS as Poe pilots aggressively. 
sw_L2385 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ I got to get to my droid before the First Order does! 
sw_L2386 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ What - a droid?! 
sw_L2387 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange and white: one of a kind. 
sw_L2388 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important! 
sw_L2389 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ This one is, pal. 
sw_L2390 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can! We go back to Jakku, we die! 
sw_L2391 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker! 
sw_L2392 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Oh, you gotta be kidding me!!! I-- Suddenly BAM! THEY ARE HIT! 
sw_L2393 +++$+++ sw_u197 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ CAPTAIN PHASMA +++$+++ FN-2187 reported to my division, was evaluated and sent to Reconditioning. 
sw_L2394 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ No prior signs of non-conformity?     
sw_L2395 +++$+++ sw_u197 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ CAPTAIN PHASMA +++$+++ This was his first offense. A technician checks her readings, reports to General Hux. 
sw_L2396 +++$+++ sw_u207 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN #1 +++$+++ General. They've been hit. 
sw_L2397 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ Destroyed? 
sw_L2398 +++$+++ sw_u207 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN #1 +++$+++ 
sw_L2399 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ They were going back for the droid -- send a squad to the wreckage. 
sw_L2400 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Poe! Poe! Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER, SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. He thinks he sees POE'S ARM -- he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET. He throws that off and tries to find a way in -- even a way to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible. 
sw_L2401 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it if we must. 
sw_L2402 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ How capable are your soldiers, General? 
sw_L2403 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ 
sw_L2404 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army. 
sw_L2405 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ 
sw_L2406 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. Unharmed. 
sw_L2407 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ Careful, Ren. That your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke. 
sw_L2408 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ I want that map. For your sake, I suggest you get it. Ren heads off. Hux hates him. 
sw_L2409 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Water... water... water.. He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like creature  DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted. 
sw_L2410 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++  Who? Him? Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant. Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT HIM, quarterstaff in hand. Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF! Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She holds the staff on him threateningly: 
sw_L2411 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ What's your hurry, thief? 
sw_L2412 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ What--?! Thief? BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES 
sw_L2413 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ The jacket! This droid says you stole it! 
sw_L2414 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!! I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!! (BB-8 has ZAPPED him 
sw_L2415 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Where'd you get it? It belongs to his master. Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard decision: to tell the truth. 
sw_L2416 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right? Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more. 
sw_L2417 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ So you're with the Resistance?   
sw_L2418 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with the Resistance, yeah. 
sw_L2419 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I've never met a Resistance fighter before. 
sw_L2420 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Well, this is what we look like. Some of us. Others look different. 
sw_L2421 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ BB-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base. 
sw_L2422 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone's after it. She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks: 
sw_L2423 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth. Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees. 
sw_L2424 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Come on! Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT, SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run! 
sw_L2425 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Come on, BB-8! 
sw_L2426 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Let go of me! 
sw_L2427 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ No, we gotta move! 
sw_L2428 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++  I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way! Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing them! They disappear through a tent. TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET. 
sw_L2429 +++$+++ sw_u203 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER +++$+++ Call in the air strike! REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent: 
sw_L2430 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ They're shooting at both of us! 
sw_L2431 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Yeah, they saw you with me! You're marked! 
sw_L2432 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Well, thanks for that! 
sw_L2433 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?! 
sw_L2434 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ 
sw_L2435 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Hey! As Finn comes to, he sees her. Through his fog: 
sw_L2436 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ -- Are you okay? And that very question touches her -- having never in her life been asked it. 
sw_L2437 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Yeah.  Follow me. Grateful, Finn takes it. They're off. LOCALS run amok as TIE fighters DIVE BOMB. REY, Finn and BB- 
sw_L2438 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ We can't outrun them! Rey POINTS to a parked, four-engine SHIP ahead: 
sw_L2439 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ We might in that quad-jumper! 
sw_L2440 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ We need a pilot! 
sw_L2441 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ We've got one!     
sw_L2442 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ You?! You?! (then, indicates one 
sw_L2443 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ That one's garbage! They run for the JUMPER but the passing TIE FIGHTERS FIRE AT IT, BLOWING IT APART IN A HUGE FLAME BALL! Rey, coming to a quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA: 
sw_L2444 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Gunner position's down there! 
sw_L2445 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ 
sw_L2446 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ No! This ship hasn't been flown in years! 
sw_L2447 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Great.  Whoa! I can do this, I can do this-- 
sw_L2448 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I can do this, I can do this-- Rey pulls the yoke: 
sw_L2449 +++$+++ sw_u199 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ UNKAR +++$+++ 
sw_L2450 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay low! 
sw_L2451 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ 
sw_L2452 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Stay low! It confuses their tracking! For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to the co-pilot controls -- THE FALCON CANTS! 
sw_L2453 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ BB-8, hold on! Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke, stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move. 
sw_L2454 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ 
sw_L2455 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ What are you doing back there? Are you ever gonna fire back?!   Finn flicks switches -- The GUN TARGETING LIGHTS UP: 
sw_L2456 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I'm working on it! Are the shields up? Rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat. 
sw_L2457 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Not so easy without a co-pilot! Finn struggles with the gun controls and SWEEPING CHAIR: 
sw_L2458 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Try sitting in this thing! Finn finally FIRES BACK at the two TIE FIGHTERS! 
sw_L2459 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ We need cover, quick! 
sw_L2460 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ We're about to get some! 
sw_L2461 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Damn it! Rey maneuvers the ship deeper into the graveyard. 
sw_L2462 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Come on... come on... -- HITS AND SHATTERS the TIE FIGHTER! 
sw_L2463 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Nice shot! 
sw_L2464 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I'm getting pretty good at this! 
sw_L2465 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ The cannon's stuck in forward position, I can't move it! You gotta lose 'em! 
sw_L2466 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Get ready! 
sw_L2467 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Okay! For what? 
sw_L2468 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ 
sw_L2469 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Oh no! Just as the TIE PILOT GETS A LOCK, Rey YANKS THE YOKE -- 
sw_L2470 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Whooo! The Falcon ROARS OFF, victorious, leaving the ship graveyard and disappearing into the clouds. 
sw_L2471 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Finn. What's yours. 
sw_L2472 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I'm Rey. BB-8 looks at him: really? Finn is reminded: HE'S LIED TO HER. She looks at Finn with a sweet smile. 
sw_L2473 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Rey... But before Finn can say anything they JUMP: across the lounge, STEAM BURSTS from under the grating. 
sw_L2474 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Help me with this! Quick! They hurry to the grating, PULL IT UP together. BB-8 rolls over, watches. 
sw_L2475 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Whoa! What's going on? She goes below as BB-8 BEEPS concern. 
sw_L2476 +++$+++ sw_u206 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT MITAKA +++$+++ Sir. We were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing. 
sw_L2477 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ The droid... stole a freighter? 
sw_L2478 +++$+++ sw_u206 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT MITAKA +++$+++ Not exactly, sir. It had help. Ren says nothing. Which says everything. Mitaka sweats. 
sw_L2479 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Anything else? Mitaka hates to say the following, but: 
sw_L2480 +++$+++ sw_u206 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT MITAKA +++$+++ The two were accompanied by a girl. Ren reaches out -- Mitaka is suddenly, violently PULLED TOWARD REN, into his black glove: 
sw_L2481 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ What girl? 
sw_L2482 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench -- check in there! As he checks a storage box, she disappears down below, overwhelmed by the technical issues -- 
sw_L2483 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ How bad is it?!       
sw_L2484 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ If we wanna live, not good! BB-8 watches as Finn searches A SELECTION OF TOOLS: 
sw_L2485 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system! Rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench. 
sw_L2486 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is "need to know" -- if I'm taking you there, I need to know! 
sw_L2487 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++  This? She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8 alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently: 
sw_L2488 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Pilex driver, hurry! Finn moves for the tool. 
sw_L2489 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++  Go on BB-8, tell her. 
sw_L2490 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ The Ileenium system? Finn hands her the tool, surprised but thrilled -- Rey disappears below again. 
sw_L2491 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can. A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it. 
sw_L2492 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. I need the bonding tape, hurry! 
sw_L2493 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++  What about you? 
sw_L2494 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I gotta get back to Jakku! 
sw_L2495 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++  BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! ! 
sw_L2496 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas! Bb-8 has moved to Finn -- TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool. He throws her the tape, she disappears below: 
sw_L2497 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ This? 
sw_L2498 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Yes! 
sw_L2499 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend? The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed: 
sw_L2500 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ None of your business, THAT'S WHY! But then: ALL THE SHIP POWER GOES OUT. BB-8 is nervous.   
sw_L2501 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ ... That can't be good. 
sw_L2502 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ 
sw_L2503 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Someone's locked onto us -- all controls are overridden. Finn quickly, awkwardly climbs up, looks out. 
sw_L2504 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ ... Oh no. 
sw_L2505 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ It's the First Order. 
sw_L2506 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ What do we do-- there must be 
sw_L2507 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ You said poisonous gas -- 
sw_L2508 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ -- Yeah, but I fixed that -- 
sw_L2509 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Can you unfix it? Rey stares at him -- and gets his plan! They head off -- 
sw_L2510 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ C'mon BB-8. They help BB-8 down, too: they both struggle like crazy, he weighs a TON. 
sw_L2511 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I got it. 
sw_L2512 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Oooh... 
sw_L2513 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I'm okay. BB-8 get off me... 
sw_L2514 +++$+++ sw_u208 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ UNDER THE GRATING +++$+++ Finn pulls the grating over them as Rey works on the controls. 
sw_L2515 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers? 
sw_L2516 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins. LIGHTS COME ON! SOUND of the SHIP RAMP LOWERING! Finn PULLS THE GRATING CLOSED as he says: 
sw_L2517 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I'm hurrying! Suddenly the FALCON DOOR OPENS -- AND HAN SOLO AND CHEWBACCA BOARD THE FALCON, weapons at the ready. PUSH IN ON THEM, ready for combat, operating silently, with hand signals only. 
sw_L2518 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Chewie, we're home. Han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. Chewie heads off one way, Han in another. The grating above LIFTS OFF -- hands in surrender, they look up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening. They're SCARED. 
sw_L2519 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ ...I'm the pilot...   
sw_L2520 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You? Chewie MOAN-TALKS. Rey responds to him -- 
sw_L2521 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ No, it's true: we're the only ones on board. 
sw_L2522 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ You can understand that thing? 
sw_L2523 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ And "that thing" can understand you too, so watch it. Come on outta there. They climb up -- BB-8 uses his magnetic arm to quickly pull himself out. 
sw_L2524 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Niima Outpost. 
sw_L2525 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Jakku?! That junkyard? 
sw_L2526 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Thank you! Junkyard! 
sw_L2527 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ 
sw_L2528 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain. 
sw_L2529 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good. Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. Doesn't see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles. Chewie responds as Han heads toward the cockpit. 
sw_L2530 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo?       
sw_L2531 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I used to be. 
sw_L2532 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Han Solo? The Rebellion General? 
sw_L2533 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ No, the smuggler! 
sw_L2534 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ 
sw_L2535 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs...! 
sw_L2536 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Twelve! Fourteen. A moment of private joy. Then he sees something that ANNOYS 
sw_L2537 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, puts too much stress on 
sw_L2538 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ 
sw_L2539 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Wait! No -- we need your help! 
sw_L2540 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ My help? 
sw_L2541 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible!     
sw_L2542 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker. Yup: Han stops in his tracks. 
sw_L2543 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke. Suddenly: a distant, METALLIC KA-CHUNK! 
sw_L2544 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Wait -- a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey! 
sw_L2545 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you? 
sw_L2546 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I'm hauling Rathtars. On the CONTROL PANEL: IMAGES ON SCREENS FROM ALL AROUND THE SHIP. Including the EXTERIOR, where a TRANSPORT SHIP is LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER. Han is fearful. 
sw_L2547 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ What's a Rathtar? 
sw_L2548 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?! 
sw_L2549 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ No. 
sw_L2550 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Good. They turn a corner: 
sw_L2551 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I got three of 'em going to King Prana. 
sw_L2552 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ THREE?! How'd you get them on board? 
sw_L2553 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I used to have a bigger crew. Chewie GROAN-TALKS, concurring. 
sw_L2554 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Get below deck and stay there until I say so -- don't even think about taking the Falcon. 
sw_L2555 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ What about BB-8? 
sw_L2556 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ He stays with me -- until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way. 
sw_L2557 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ What about the Rathtars... where are you keeping them? A TERRIFYING BAM: a GROTESQUE RATHTAR GIANT TONGUE SLAMS into the CARGO CONTAINER window behind Finn, whose heart stops. 
sw_L2558 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ There's one. 
sw_L2559 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ What are you gonna do? 
sw_L2560 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it. 
sw_L2561 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Bala-Tik. What's the problem? 
sw_L2562 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Can you see them? 
sw_L2563 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ No. They start crawling down the crawl space. 
sw_L2564 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You know you can't trust those little freaks! How long've we known each other? Rey and Finn arrive under the gang. They WHISPER: 
sw_L2565 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ They have blasters... 
sw_L2566 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ A lot of 'em. We RISE THROUGH THE FLOOR to see the GANG and Han and company in the distance. 
sw_L2567 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money. 
sw_L2568 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I never made a deal with Kanjiklub! 
sw_L2569 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Tasu Leech. Good to see you. Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE: 
sw_L2570 +++$+++ sw_u210 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ TASU LEECH +++$+++ Wrong again, Solo. It's over for you. Tasu COCKS HIS WEAPON, there for blood. BB-8 is nervous. Finn and Rey react to the sounds of the new gang -- start CRAWLING BACK the other way to see them. 
sw_L2571 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Boys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever not delivered for you before? 
sw_L2572 +++$+++ sw_u210 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ TASU LEECH +++$+++ Twice! Han realizes he's right. 
sw_L2573 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ What was the second time? 
sw_L2574 +++$+++ sw_u210 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ TASU LEECH +++$+++ Nowhere left for you to hide.       
sw_L2575 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ First I've heard of it. Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid. Above, another Kanjiklubber  says (SUBTITLED): 
sw_L2576 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs! 
sw_L2577 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Close the blast doors from here? 
sw_L2578 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Resetting the fuses should do it. Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as they do. Finn quickly joins in. Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too. DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS -- 
sw_L2579 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ ... I got a bad feeling about this... Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below, where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned. 
sw_L2580 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Oh no. 
sw_L2581 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Oh no, what? 
sw_L2582 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ 
sw_L2583 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ This was a mistake! 
sw_L2584 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Huge! 
sw_L2585 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ What do they look like?   
sw_L2586 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ They look like that. Finn yanks her away. They race around another corner -- a 
sw_L2587 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Are you sure? They scream and run off -- but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAY 
sw_L2588 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ 
sw_L2589 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ 
sw_L2590 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Finn! 
sw_L2591 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ It had me! But the door--!     
sw_L2592 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ That was lucky! ANOTHER CORRIDOR - Finn and Rey run towards the Falcon. 
sw_L2593 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I got the door. Cover us! Chewie GROAN-AGREES. Chewie FIRES DOWN THE HALL as Han CROSSES THE CORRIDOR, BB-8 following nervously. As Chewie exchanges blaster fire, Han works the controls. THE HATCH OPENS  -- just as CHEWIE IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER BY ENEMY FIRE! He goes down with a 
sw_L2594 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Han! Finn and Rey race past BB-8 -- as they go up the ramp, Han says to Rey: 
sw_L2595 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You, close the door behind us! 
sw_L2596 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Hey, where are you going?         
sw_L2597 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too -- if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere. 
sw_L2598 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I hate that guy. Han sits as, Rey hitting buttons: 
sw_L2599 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ And you could use a co-pilot. 
sw_L2600 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I got one, he's back there. 
sw_L2601 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of here at lightspeed -- 
sw_L2602 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ 
sw_L2603 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I never ask that question until after I've done it. A RATHTAR JUMPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD -- REY SCREAMS! Its GIANT MOUTH CHEWING AT THE GLASS! Han works the controls: 
sw_L2604 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ 
sw_L2605 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Come on baby, don't let me down! He hits a switch -- but NOTHING. 
sw_L2606 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Compressor. Han doesn't like it but she's right -- he hits the switch again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO: 
sw_L2607 +++$+++ sw_u211 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ ... Leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise. 
sw_L2608 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility for th-- 
sw_L2609 +++$+++ sw_u211 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ General! Our strategy must now change. 
sw_L2610 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic. Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker. Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then: 
sw_L2611 +++$+++ sw_u211 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ Go. Oversee preparations. 
sw_L2612 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ Yes, Supreme Leader. General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him go. Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice. 
sw_L2613 +++$+++ sw_u211 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ There's been an awakening. Have you felt it? 
sw_L2614 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Yes. 
sw_L2615 +++$+++ sw_u211 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. In the hands of your father, Han Solo. Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise. 
sw_L2616 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ He means nothing to me. 
sw_L2617 +++$+++ sw_u211 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ Even you, master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test.         
sw_L2618 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ 
sw_L2619 +++$+++ sw_u211 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ We shall see. We shall see. A gentle, satisfied nod from Snoke, and Kylo Ren, obsessed, filled up, exits. Snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque evil SMILE growing -- as he DISINTEGRATES -- Snoke has been a HOLOGRAM all along. 
sw_L2620 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Electrical overload! 
sw_L2621 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I can fix that! 
sw_L2622 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ The coolant's leaking! 
sw_L2623 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank-- 
sw_L2624 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ -- Secondary tank, I got it! 
sw_L2625 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Chewie, come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! Stop moving! Chewie! 
sw_L2626 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me! 
sw_L2627 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Hurt him?! He almost killed me six times!  Which is fine. 
sw_L2628 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems. Han at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied, sits in the co-pilot seat. Han is confused. 
sw_L2629 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I by-passed the compressor. He looks at her. A little, appreciative laugh. Han exits, walking past BB-8. 
sw_L2630 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Move, Ball. 
sw_L2631 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Nah, don't say that, you did great. Just rest. Han turns to Finn, who sits at the HOLOCHESS set, BB-8 beside him. This is awkward for Han, but damn, he means it: 
sw_L2632 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ You're welcome. Finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. The pieces start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to turn it off. 
sw_L2633 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ So, fugitives, huh? 
sw_L2634 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ The First Order wants the map. 
sw_L2635 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Let's see whatcha got. 
sw_L2636 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ 
sw_L2637 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him. 
sw_L2638 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Why'd he leave? 
sw_L2639 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ He was training a new generation of Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible... He walked away from everything. 
sw_L2640 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Do you know what happened to him? 
sw_L2641 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ There're a lot of rumors. Stories. The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple. 
sw_L2642 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ The Jedi were real? 
sw_L2643 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I used to wonder that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo -- magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light. 
sw_L2644 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ 
sw_L2645 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here -- 
sw_L2646 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ D'you just call me "Solo"?     
sw_L2647 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order sympathizers? 
sw_L2648 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Hands him a BLASTER. 
sw_L2649 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You might need this. 
sw_L2650 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I think I can handle myself. 
sw_L2651 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. Rey picks it up. Grips it. 
sw_L2652 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Yeah, you pull the trigger. 
sw_L2653 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ There's a little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name? 
sw_L2654 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Rey. 
sw_L2655 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Rey. I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon.       
sw_L2656 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Are you offering me a job? 
sw_L2657 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much. 
sw_L2658 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ You're offering me a job. 
sw_L2659 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I'm thinking about it. Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she can't cross. 
sw_L2660 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home. Han looks at her, questioningly. 
sw_L2661 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Jakku? Rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku. 
sw_L2662 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ 
sw_L2663 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ 
sw_L2664 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Solo, why are we here again? 
sw_L2665 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ To get your droid on a clean ship. 
sw_L2666 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Clean?       
sw_L2667 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet. 
sw_L2668 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ We can trust her, right? 
sw_L2669 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare... 
sw_L2670 +++$+++ sw_u212 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY AND FINN +++$+++ At what? 
sw_L2671 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Any of it. The door opens. Music. Madness. And... 
sw_L2672 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ Han Solo! Everyone turns to look. It's ALL QUIET in here. 
sw_L2673 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++  Oh boy. (Louder, waving) Hey, Maz! NOISE returns. Maz walks to them, pushes someone away. 
sw_L2674 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ Where's my boyfriend? 
sw_L2675 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Chewie's working on the Falcon. 
sw_L2676 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ I like that Wookiee. I assume you need something. Desperately. Let's get to it.     
sw_L2677 +++$+++ sw_u214 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ BAZINE +++$+++ Inform the First Order... I've found the droid. 
sw_L2678 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Forgive me. I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me, Grandfather, and I will finish what you started. As his emotion builds, he stands and heads off -- we FOLLOW HIM, PIVOTING TO REVEAL who he was talking to: THE BURNT, 
sw_L2679 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ A map to Skywalker himself? You're right back in the mess. 
sw_L2680 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.   
sw_L2681 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ Hmm. No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. Han, nyakee nago wadda. Go home! 
sw_L2682 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Leia doesn't want to see me. 
sw_L2683 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Please, we came here for your help. 
sw_L2684 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ What fight? 
sw_L2685 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ The only fight: against the dark side. Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today, it is the First Order. Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us. 
sw_L2686 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ There is no fight against the First Order! Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right-- Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing him -- her eyes get HUGE. 
sw_L2687 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I don't know, but it ain't good. 
sw_L2688 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people. I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run. 
sw_L2689 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++  You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen. 
sw_L2690 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ You see those two? They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. There, you can disappear. Finn sees them. Considers. 
sw_L2691 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Finn! 
sw_L2692 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Come with me. 
sw_L2693 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base. 
sw_L2694 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I can't. Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han. 
sw_L2695 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Keep it, kid. Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses back to normal, and turns to Han. 
sw_L2696 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ Who's the girl? 
sw_L2697 +++$+++ sw_u215 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ ON FINN +++$+++ Who has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS. 
sw_L2698 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim. Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting. 
sw_L2699 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ What are you doing? Finn gets up to talk to her. 
sw_L2700 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++  Don't leave without me.     
sw_L2701 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ You can't just go. I won't let you. 
sw_L2702 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I'm not who you think I am. 
sw_L2703 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Finn, what are you talking about? 
sw_L2704 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper. 
sw_L2705 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Don't go. 
sw_L2706 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Take care of yourself. Please. Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey watches Finn return to the aliens... And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks through it. Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked back at her one last time. 
sw_L2707 +++$+++ sw_u216 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ YOUNG GIRL +++$+++ 
sw_L2708 +++$+++ sw_u216 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ YOUNG GIRL +++$+++ No, come back!     
sw_L2709 +++$+++ sw_u217 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ UNKAR PLUTT +++$+++ Quiet, girl! The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around her to see she is.. In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind, confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound. Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN: 
sw_L2710 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there. 
sw_L2711 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ That lightsaber was Luke's. And his father's before him and now, it calls to you! Rey stands, fast. Still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless. 
sw_L2712 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I have to get back to Jakku. 
sw_L2713 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ Han told me. Han told me. (reaches out, hold 
sw_L2714 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Luke. 
sw_L2715 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ The belonging you seek is not behind you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi, but I know the Force. It moves through and surrounds every living thing. Close your eyes. Feel it. 
sw_L2716 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I'm never touching that again. I don't want any part of this. And Rey runs off, passing Maz. Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl. 
sw_L2717 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ Today is the end of the Republic! The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! At this very moment, in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand, will bring an end to the Senate! To their cherished fleet! All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! And will remember this... as the last day of the Republic!   
sw_L2718 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ 
sw_L2719 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ What are you doing? 
sw_L2720 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ I've had this for ages... 
sw_L2721 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ Kept it locked away. 
sw_L2722 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Where'd you get that? 
sw_L2723 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ A good question for another time. 
sw_L2724 +++$+++ sw_u203 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER +++$+++ FN-417, hold position! Rey takes cover, grabs her BLASTER -- but IT WON'T FIRE! She panics, then realizes: 
sw_L2725 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Safety! SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS and retreats, calls to BB-8: BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more chasing Troopers! 
sw_L2726 +++$+++ sw_u218 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER #4 +++$+++ Sir, the droid was spotted heading west, with a girl. Kylo Ren LOOKS BACK SHARPLY, in Rey's direction -- 
sw_L2727 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ You have to keep going, stay out of sight, I'll try to fight 'em off.  I hope so, too. BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE -- 
sw_L2728 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Come on, Chewie! Maz turns to Finn: 
sw_L2729 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now go. 
sw_L2730 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I need a weapon. Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER. 
sw_L2731 +++$+++ sw_u213 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ You have one! He looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the lightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON. HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at Stormtroopers, taking some out! 
sw_L2732 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Hey, can I try that? Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers and sends them flying. 
sw_L2733 +++$+++ sw_u203 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER +++$+++ Traitor! FINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. The Mace Trooper KNOCKS FINN DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him, when THE STORMTROOPER IS SHOT AND FALLS! Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast! Han helps him up. 
sw_L2734 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You okay, Big deal?   
sw_L2735 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Thanks! But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED. 
sw_L2736 +++$+++ sw_u203 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER +++$+++ Don't move! TK-338, we have targets in custody!   
sw_L2737 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ It's the Resistance. One X-WING in particular -- MARKED IN BLACK -- SWOOPS DOWN and takes out the parked TIE FIGHTERS and Troopers! 
sw_L2738 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you! 
sw_L2739 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Quick! Chewie picks up his Bowcaster, Han takes the blaster. Shoots a Trooper. 
sw_L2740 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva pilot! 
sw_L2741 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ 
sw_L2742 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ The girl I've heard so much about. He walks AROUND HER, slowly, she won't let herself cry. 
sw_L2743 +++$+++ sw_u203 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER +++$+++ Request air support! 
sw_L2744 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ The map. You've seen it. Rey is horrified. He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears stream. Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind... She stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony -- Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE EXPLOSIONS. Stormtroopers APPROACH through the woods. 
sw_L2745 +++$+++ sw_u219 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER #5 +++$+++ Sir, Resistance fighters! We need more troops. Kylo Ren TURNS BACK TO Rey, his hand still on her face.   
sw_L2746 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Pull the division out. Forget the droid. We have what we need. A GESTURE from Kylo Ren and REY LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS, FALLS 
sw_L2747 +++$+++ sw_u203 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER +++$+++ Pull back the tree line! Han and Chewie dodge debris, FIRING and TAKING OUT TROOPERS. FINN takes out 2 TROOPERS with the blaster, then, out of breath, turns to see: Kylo Ren in the forest, CARRYING REY IN HIS ARMS, INTO HIS SHUTTLE! Finn's heart SHATTERS -- Han stops -- turns -- sees Kylo Ren entering his shuttle. Han is ROCKED. 
sw_L2748 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ 
sw_L2749 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ He took her! Did you see that? He took her. She's gone! 
sw_L2750 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ 
sw_L2751 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You changed your hair. 
sw_L2752 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Same jacket. 
sw_L2753 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ No, new jacket. Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship. It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly: 
sw_L2754 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Poe. Poe Dameron. They move to each other -- and embrace. 
sw_L2755 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ So are you! 
sw_L2756 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ What happened to you? 
sw_L2757 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ What happened? I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing-- BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe listens, turns to Finn. 
sw_L2758 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ No, no, no. It wasn't just me. 
sw_L2759 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ You completed my mission, Finn. That's my jacket?     
sw_L2760 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Oh here. 
sw_L2761 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ No, no, no. Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man, Finn. 
sw_L2762 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Poe -- I need your help. 
sw_L2763 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ General Organa. Sorry to interrupt, this is Finn, he needs to talk to 
sw_L2764 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++  And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave, what you did. Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life -- 
sw_L2765 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++  Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner-- 
sw_L2766 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry. Finn is startled -- Poe jumps in: 
sw_L2767 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. He worked on the base. 
sw_L2768 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ We're desperate for anything you can tell us. 
sw_L2769 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ That's where my friend was taken -- I've got to get there, fast. 
sw_L2770 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ And I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know. 
sw_L2771 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home. 
sw_L2772 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Leia... 
sw_L2773 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Don't do that. 
sw_L2774 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Do what? She heads off. 
sw_L2775 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Anything. Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO. 
sw_L2776 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I'm trying to be helpful!         
sw_L2777 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star. 
sw_L2778 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ 
sw_L2779 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him. 
sw_L2780 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You think I want to forget him? I want him back! Han looks at her with sympathy. 
sw_L2781 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ There was nothing we could've done.  There was too much Vader in him. 
sw_L2782 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both.         
sw_L2783 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever good at. 
sw_L2784 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ We both did. 
sw_L2785 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ We lost our son, forever. 
sw_L2786 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ No. 
sw_L2787 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ If Luke couldn't reach him, how could 
sw_L2788 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Luke is a Jedi... you're his father. There's still light in him. I know it. 
sw_L2789 +++$+++ sw_u221 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL STATURA +++$+++ General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming. 
sw_L2790 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Where am I? 
sw_L2791 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ 
sw_L2792 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Where are the others? 
sw_L2793 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ You mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends?  You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea.     
sw_L2794 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask. Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment before she regains her own mask of defiance. 
sw_L2795 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Tell me about the droid. 
sw_L2796 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++  He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator -- 
sw_L2797 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ He's carrying a section of a navigational chart. We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. We need the last piece. And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger -- Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know? 
sw_L2798 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ -- Get out of my head -- But this just makes Kylo lean closer. 
sw_L2799 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ I know you've seen the map. It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too. Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but: 
sw_L2800 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I'm not giving you anything. 
sw_L2801 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ We'll see. He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze -- 
sw_L2802 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ ... You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... Darth Vader! KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on Kylo Ren, who starts to leave. And we PRELAP: 
sw_L2803 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows. And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke: 
sw_L2804 +++$+++ sw_u211 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ And the droid?     
sw_L2805 +++$+++ sw_u211 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker. 
sw_L2806 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ We have their location. We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system. 
sw_L2807 +++$+++ sw_u211 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ Good. Then we will crush them once and for all. Prepare the weapon. Kylo Ren is stunned by the moment -- that isn't what he meant at all -- 
sw_L2808 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Supreme Leader. I can get the map from the girl. I just need your guidance. 
sw_L2809 +++$+++ sw_u211 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ If what you say about this girl is true, bring her to me. 
sw_L2810 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. A beat.     
sw_L2811 +++$+++ sw_u222 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ TROOPER GUARD #2 +++$+++ What did you say? Rey's eyes stay trained on him. She shifts in her seat, her confidence wavering, but she repeats, with authority: 
sw_L2812 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER. Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or laughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says: 
sw_L2813 +++$+++ sw_u222 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ TROOPER GUARD #2 +++$+++ I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum! 
sw_L2814 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. 
sw_L2815 +++$+++ sw_u222 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ TROOPER GUARD #2 +++$+++ I will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. He reaches down and UNLATCHES THE RESTRAINTS. HE THEN TURNS AND STARTS TO HEAD OUT, her back to him as he exits. SHE IS IN SHOCK. Then tries, quickly: 
sw_L2816 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ And you will drop your weapon. 
sw_L2817 +++$+++ sw_u222 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ TROOPER GUARD #2 +++$+++ And I'll drop my weapon. The Trooper Guard DROPS HIS WEAPON without turning back -- Rey HEARS the gun fall. She's incredulous. The guard has 
sw_L2818 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ 
sw_L2819 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ Begin charging the weapon! 
sw_L2820 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report. 
sw_L2821 +++$+++ sw_u223 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNAP +++$+++ They've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself. 
sw_L2822 +++$+++ sw_u224 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ BRANCE +++$+++ A laser cannon?         
sw_L2823 +++$+++ sw_u223 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNAP +++$+++ We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale. 
sw_L2824 +++$+++ sw_u225 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAJOR EMATT +++$+++ 
sw_L2825 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ I wish that were the case, Major. Poe hits a control. A WIREFRAME OF THE DEATH STAR APPEARS. 
sw_L2826 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ So it's big. 
sw_L2827 +++$+++ sw_u226 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ACKBAR +++$+++ How is it possible to power a weapon of this size? 
sw_L2828 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ It uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears. An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD. 
sw_L2829 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++  The First Order: they're charging the weapon again, now. (then, heart sinking) Our system is the next target. 
sw_L2830 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Okay, how do we blow it up?  There's always a way to do that.     
sw_L2831 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Han's right. Han is surprised. 
sw_L2832 +++$+++ sw_u227 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ ADMIRAL STATURA +++$+++  In order for that amount of power to be contained, that base would need some kind of thermal oscillator... 
sw_L2833 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ There is one. All eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location on the Starkiller Base -- it is ZOOMED IN: A GIANT BLACK 
sw_L2834 +++$+++ sw_u227 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ ADMIRAL STATURA +++$+++ 
sw_L2835 +++$+++ sw_u225 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MAJOR EMATT +++$+++ ... Maybe the planet. Poe then tries to bolster spirits, looking at the BIG HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE: the Oscillator. 
sw_L2836 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got. 
sw_L2837 +++$+++ sw_u226 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ACKBAR +++$+++ They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate. 
sw_L2838 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ We disable the shields. 
sw_L2839 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++  I can do it. 
sw_L2840 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I like this guy.         
sw_L2841 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I can disable the shields. But I have to be there, on the planet-- 
sw_L2842 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ We'll get you there. 
sw_L2843 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Han, how? 
sw_L2844 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ If I told you, you wouldn't like it. 
sw_L2845 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ So we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. All right. Let's go! And everyone splits. 
sw_L2846 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Chewie, check that donal capitator. Come on. Let's go. -- Finn, be careful with those - they're explosives. 
sw_L2847 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Now you tell me? 
sw_L2848 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave. Han looks over, there's Leia. 
sw_L2849 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ That's what I did it. So you'd miss me. She laughs, moves up close to him.   
sw_L2850 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I did miss you. He looks at her, says sweetly, out of the blue: 
sw_L2851 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh? Some of it was...good. 
sw_L2852 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ ... Pretty good. 
sw_L2853 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Some things never change. 
sw_L2854 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ 
sw_L2855 +++$+++ sw_u203 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER +++$+++ Sir, sensors triggered in hangar 718. We're searching the area. 
sw_L2856 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ She's just beginning to test her powers. The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes. Kylo exits. 
sw_L2857 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ How are we getting in? 
sw_L2858 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through. Finn is suddenly filled with dread. 
sw_L2859 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?! Chewie, thinking it's crazy too, says: HELL YES WE ARE! 
sw_L2860 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Alright, Chewie, get ready. Chewie GROANS: he's ready. Han studies the PANEL INDICATORS. 
sw_L2861 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ 
sw_L2862 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I get any higher, they'll see us! And the ship DIVES again, back into the trees! 
sw_L2863 +++$+++ sw_u228 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Sir, she was not found in hangar 718 but all troops are on alert. 
sw_L2864 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Put every hangar on lock-down. She's going to try to steal a ship to-- Suddenly, Kylo senses something. Something familiar. 
sw_L2865 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. We'll get in that way. 
sw_L2866 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ What was your job when you were based here? 
sw_L2867 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Sanitation. 
sw_L2868 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields? 
sw_L2869 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I don't. I'm just here to get Rey. 
sw_L2870 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us--! 
sw_L2871 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force! 
sw_L2872 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ That's not how the Force works--!   
sw_L2873 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Come on! They follow Finn on the snowy hike. On the horizon, THE 
sw_L2874 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ Report. 
sw_L2875 +++$+++ sw_u229 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FIRST ORDER OFFICER +++$+++ Weapon charged in fifteen minutes, sir. 
sw_L2876 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ The longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. The shields? 
sw_L2877 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I have an idea about that. Han and Chewie follow Finn. 
sw_L2878 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Remember me?   
sw_L2879 +++$+++ sw_u197 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ CAPTAIN PHASMA +++$+++ 
sw_L2880 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Not anymore. The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge. 
sw_L2881 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Bring it down. Bring it down. 
sw_L2882 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Follow me. Finn SMILES as we CUT TO: 
sw_L2883 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ You want me to blast that bucket off your head? Lower the shields. 
sw_L2884 +++$+++ sw_u197 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ CAPTAIN PHASMA +++$+++ You're making a big mistake. 
sw_L2885 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Do it. Chewie MOAN/TALKS. Phasma hits a few more buttons -- the controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLE INITIATE". Eyes on 
sw_L2886 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Don't worry kid, we won't leave here without her. The controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLED". 
sw_L2887 +++$+++ sw_u197 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ CAPTAIN PHASMA +++$+++  You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy. My troops will storm this block and kill you all. 
sw_L2888 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I disagree. What do we do with her? 
sw_L2889 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Is there a garbage chute? Trash compactor? 
sw_L2890 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Yeah, there is... 
sw_L2891 +++$+++ sw_u228 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ General, their shields are down! 
sw_L2892 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Han did it! Send them in! 
sw_L2893 +++$+++ sw_u227 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ ADMIRAL STATURA +++$+++ Give Poe full authorization to attack. 
sw_L2894 +++$+++ sw_u230 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REAR ADMIRAL +++$+++ 
sw_L2895 +++$+++ sw_u231 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GULCH +++$+++ Black Leader, go to sub-lights. On your call. 
sw_L2896 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Roger, base -- red squad, blue squad, take my lead. 
sw_L2897 +++$+++ sw_u232 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ YOLO ZIFF +++$+++ Dropping out of lightspeed. 
sw_L2898 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Almost in range! Hit the target dead center, as many runs as we can get! 
sw_L2899 +++$+++ sw_u223 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNAP +++$+++ Approaching target. 
sw_L2900 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ Dispatch all squadrons... 
sw_L2901 +++$+++ sw_u233 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ COLONEL DATOO +++$+++ Yes, General. 
sw_L2902 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Let's light it up! 
sw_L2903 +++$+++ sw_u234 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ ELLO ASTY +++$+++ But no damage! Jess reacts. 
sw_L2904 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it! Another bombing run! Remember, when that sun is gone, that weapon will be ready to fire! But as long as there's light, we got a chance. 
sw_L2905 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Guys, we got a lot of company! 
sw_L2906 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover. 
sw_L2907 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You sure you're up for this? 
sw_L2908 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey --  -- The troopers'll be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that'll leads -- (Han starts pointing with his chin to 
sw_L2909 +++$+++ sw_u235 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SOMETHING BEHIND +++$+++ 
sw_L2910 +++$+++ sw_u226 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ACKBAR +++$+++ The Oscillator's still standing. 
sw_L2911 +++$+++ sw_u228 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ X-wings coming back for another round of attacks! 
sw_L2912 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Are you all right? 
sw_L2913 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Yeah. 
sw_L2914 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Good. 
sw_L2915 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ What happened -- did he hurt you? 
sw_L2916 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Finn. What are you doing here?! 
sw_L2917 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ We came back for you. She is speechless -- this is all she's ever wanted anyone to do. Chewie TALKS -- and Rey's eyes nearly tear up. 
sw_L2918 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++  ... That it was your idea. Finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace. 
sw_L2919 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ How did you get away? 
sw_L2920 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it. 
sw_L2921 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Escape now. Hug later. 
sw_L2922 +++$+++ sw_u223 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNAP +++$+++ I got one behind me. See it? 
sw_L2923 +++$+++ sw_u236 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Yeah, I'm on it!       
sw_L2924 +++$+++ sw_u236 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Furillo's been hit! 
sw_L2925 +++$+++ sw_u223 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNAP +++$+++ Watch out for ground fire! 
sw_L2926 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ They're in trouble. We can't leave.  My friend here has a bag full of explosives. Let's use 'em. 
sw_L2927 +++$+++ sw_u237 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KAYDEL KO CONNIX +++$+++ General, are you seeing this? 
sw_L2928 +++$+++ sw_u238 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ VOBER DAND +++$+++ Two more X-wings down. That's half our fleet destroyed. 
sw_L2929 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ That girl knows her stuff. 
sw_L2930 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ We'll set the charges at every other column. He GROAN/TALKS to Han, who looks around, reconsiders. 
sw_L2931 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Find them. They rush past him. Kylo Ren turns slowly, and HEADS DOWN. 
sw_L2932 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Ben! The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast catwalk. He turns. 
sw_L2933 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on the catwalk below.         
sw_L2934 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Take off that mask. You don't need it. 
sw_L2935 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ What do you think you'll see if I do? Han moves toward Kylo Ren. 
sw_L2936 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ The face of my son. Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face of his son for the first time as a man. 
sw_L2937 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish, like his father. So I destroyed him. 
sw_L2938 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. My son is alive. SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch. 
sw_L2939 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ No. The Supreme Leader is wise. UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene. ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern: 
sw_L2940 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true. Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it. 
sw_L2941 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ It's too late. 
sw_L2942 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ No it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you. For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears flood his stoic eyes... 
sw_L2943 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain. 
sw_L2944 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me? Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable. 
sw_L2945 +++$+++ sw_u209 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Yes. Anything. Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch 
sw_L2946 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Thank you. ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM -- 
sw_L2947 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ 
sw_L2948 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ 
sw_L2949 +++$+++ sw_u226 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ACKBAR +++$+++ The Oscillator's been damaged but is still functional. COMMODORE META reacts. 
sw_L2950 +++$+++ sw_u239 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ OFFICER TABALA ZO +++$+++ Admiral, their weapon will fire in two minutes. 
sw_L2951 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ The Falcon's this way. Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both out of breath. They look at each other. They both know: they can't run. 
sw_L2952 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ We're not done yet. 
sw_L2953 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ You're a monster!     
sw_L2954 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ It's just us now. Han Solo can't save you. After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT! Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER -- she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND -- another GESTURE and Rey FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away! She drops -- LANDS HARD in the snow. Dazed, hurt. 
sw_L2955 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Rey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh no no no... Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE. 
sw_L2956 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ 
sw_L2957 +++$+++ sw_u205 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Come get it. Despite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. Kylo Ren CHARGES at him - Finn terrified -- Kylo Ren LUNGES but Finn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade! Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS, COUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys this challenge more! Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two men fighting, through the trees. Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN! LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK -- wounded, but more enraged than weakened. Kylo Ren CHARGES AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK, the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers: And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity -- Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness. Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses balance.   
sw_L2958 +++$+++ sw_u240 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ NIV LEK +++$+++ We just lost R-1! 
sw_L2959 +++$+++ sw_u236 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ We're overwhelmed! What do we do? It isn't working! Another pilot looks down -- SEES THE EXPLOSION -- coming from the OSCILLATOR. Relatively small, it's an opening: 
sw_L2960 +++$+++ sw_u232 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ YOLO ZIFF +++$+++ Black Leader, there's a brand new hole in that oscillator. Looks like our friends got in! 
sw_L2961 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Red Four! Red Six! Cover us! 
sw_L2962 +++$+++ sw_u234 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ ELLO ASTY +++$+++ Roger! 
sw_L2963 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Everybody else, hit the target hard! Give it everything you got! And the X-WINGS DIVE and BLAST the OSCILLATOR -- 
sw_L2964 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ I need some help here! I need some help! 
sw_L2965 +++$+++ sw_u236 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Watch out! 
sw_L2966 +++$+++ sw_u234 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ ELLO ASTY +++$+++ I'm hit! The alien pilot's X-wing is blasted to pieces. 
sw_L2967 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ All teams - I'm going in! Pull up and cover me! 
sw_L2968 +++$+++ sw_u240 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ NIV LEK +++$+++ Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck, Poe! The trailing X-wings peel off as Poe's black fighter darts into the fiery breach. 
sw_L2969 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ Prepare to fire. 
sw_L2970 +++$+++ sw_u195 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ You need a teacher! I can show you the ways of the Force! 
sw_L2971 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ The Force. Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them, she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER! Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES 
sw_L2972 +++$+++ sw_u233 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ COLONEL DATOO +++$+++ Lieutenant, get back to your station! 
sw_L2973 +++$+++ sw_u241 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ YOUNG TECHNICIAN +++$+++  Just look. We won't survive -- even Hux has gone! As he hurries off, WE HEAR: 
sw_L2974 +++$+++ sw_u202 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ GENERAL HUX +++$+++ The fuel cells have ruptured. The collapse of the planet has begun. Snoke takes this in. Furious, desolate... knowing. 
sw_L2975 +++$+++ sw_u211 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren. 
sw_L2976 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Finn! Finn... Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries, holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores. They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all is lost... Her wet eyes look up to see: 
sw_L2977 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ All teams! I got eyes on them! 
sw_L2978 +++$+++ sw_u223 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ SNAP +++$+++ Yes! The X-wings ROAR OFF, skyward as the MUSIC SOARS, the PLANET IMPLODES -- THE SUNLIGHT IT CONTAINS BURSTS FORTH, and as we get further and further distance from what was Starkiller Base, we witness the REBIRTH OF A SUN. Light restored to a corner of the galaxy. The Millennium Falcon and the X-wings RIP THROUGH SPACE, headed home. 
sw_L2979 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Our job's done here. Let's go home! 
sw_L2980 +++$+++ sw_u242 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ MEDIC +++$+++ Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a heartbeat. Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia. C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering. Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry. The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's face in her hands. Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful. She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace. Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting. 
sw_L2981 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Tell me. Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of Resistance Officers. Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A 
sw_L2982 +++$+++ sw_u193 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on -- Poe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor San Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY -- 
sw_L2983 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++  -- Luke -- Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES. C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly: 
sw_L2984 +++$+++ sw_u200 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ We'll see each other again. I believe that. Thank you, my friend. 
sw_L2985 +++$+++ sw_u220 +++$+++ sw_m3 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Rey. Rey turns around. 
sw_L2986 +++$+++ sw_u243 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ We're not clear yet! There's still 30 pallets of cannon shells in C bunker.
sw_L2987 +++$+++ sw_u244 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KAYDEL KO CONNIX +++$+++ Forget the ammunition, there's no time. Just get everyone on the transport.  Oh, no.
sw_L2988 +++$+++ sw_u245 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PEAVEY +++$+++ We've caught them in the middle of their evacuation.
sw_L2989 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ I have my orders from Supreme Leader Snoke himself. This is where we snuff-out the resistance once and for all. Tell Captain Canady to prime his dreadnought. Incinerate their base, destroy their transports and obliterate their fleet.
sw_L2990 +++$+++ sw_u247 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ MONITOR +++$+++ General, Resistance ship approaching. Launching shields in attack mode.
sw_L2991 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++  A single light fighter?
sw_L2992 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Happy beeps here, buddy, come on.
sw_L2993 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++  We've pulled crazier stunts than this.
sw_L2994 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Just for the record, Commander Dameron, I'm with the droid on this one.
sw_L2995 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++  Thank you for your support, General.
sw_L2996 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Happy beeps. Attention!  This is Commander Poe Dameron of the Republic fleet, I have an urgent communique for General Hux.
sw_L2997 +++$+++ sw_u250 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LANK PAZE +++$+++ Patch him through.
sw_L2998 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ This is General Hux of the First Order. The Republic is no more. Your fleet are rebel scum and war criminals. Tell your precious princess there will be no terms... there will be no surrender.
sw_L2999 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++  Hi, I'm holding for General Hugs.
sw_L3000 +++$+++ sw_u251 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ HUX +++$+++ This is Hux. You and your friends are doomed! We will wipe your filth from the galaxy.
sw_L3001 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++  OK, I'll hold.
sw_L3002 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Hello?
sw_L3003 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++  Hello? Yup. I'm still here.
sw_L3004 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++  Can you.... can he hear me?
sw_L3005 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++  Hugs?
sw_L3006 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ He can.
sw_L3007 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++  With an 'H'. Skinny guy. Kinda pasty.
sw_L3008 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ I can hear you. Can you hear me?
sw_L3009 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++  Look, I can't hold forever. If you reach him.... tell him Leia has an urgent message for him.
sw_L3010 +++$+++ sw_u245 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PEAVEY +++$+++ I believe he's tooling with you, sir.
sw_L3011 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++  About his mother.
sw_L3012 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Open fire!
sw_L3013 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ BB-8, punch it!
sw_L3014 +++$+++ sw_u245 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PEAVEY +++$+++ He's going for the dreadnought.
sw_L3015 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Ha! He's insane.
sw_L3016 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++  Wa-hoo! That's got a kick.
sw_L3017 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ All right, taking out the cannons now. Tallie, start your approach.
sw_L3018 +++$+++ sw_u252 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ TALLIE +++$+++  Copy that.
sw_L3019 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++  Captain Canady, why aren't you blasting that puny ship?
sw_L3020 +++$+++ sw_u253 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ CANADY +++$+++ That 'puny ship' is too small and at close range. We need to scramble our fighters! Five bloody minutes ago.
sw_L3021 +++$+++ sw_u254 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ GONERIL +++$+++ He'll never penetrate our armor.
sw_L3022 +++$+++ sw_u253 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ CANADY +++$+++ He's not trying to penetrate our armor. He's clearing out our surface cannons.
sw_L3023 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ There's one cannon left. And here comes the parade.
sw_L3024 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, I see 'em!
sw_L3025 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ No no. Dammit! BB-8, my weapon systems are down. We gotta take out that last cannon... or our bombers are toast. Make your magic work, buddy.
sw_L3026 +++$+++ sw_u253 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ CANADY +++$+++ Are the auto cannons primed?
sw_L3027 +++$+++ sw_u254 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ GONERIL +++$+++ Primed and ready, sir.
sw_L3028 +++$+++ sw_u253 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ CANADY +++$+++ What are we waiting for? Fire on the base!
sw_L3029 +++$+++ sw_u244 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KAYDEL KO CONNIX +++$+++ Punch it!
sw_L3030 +++$+++ sw_u255 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KAYDEN KO CONNIX +++$+++  The last transport is in the air, the evacuation is complete.
sw_L3031 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You did it, Poe. Now get your squad back here so we can get out of this place.
sw_L3032 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++  No, General... We can do this. We have... a chance to take down a dreadnought.
sw_L3033 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ These things are fleet killers. We can't let it get away.
sw_L3034 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++  Disengage now... Commander, that is an order...
sw_L3035 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Wipe that nervous expression off your face, 3PO.
sw_L3036 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Let's go, BB-8... It's now or never!
sw_L3037 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Yeeeaaahh-ho! All clear, bring the bombs!
sw_L3038 +++$+++ sw_u256 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ BASCUS +++$+++ Captain... Resistance bombers approaching.
sw_L3039 +++$+++ sw_u253 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ CANADY +++$+++ Of course they are.
sw_L3040 +++$+++ sw_u252 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ TALLIE +++$+++ Bombers, keep that tight formation. Fighters, protect the bombers. It's not every day we get a shot at a dreadnought, so make this count.
sw_L3041 +++$+++ sw_u257 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINCH DALLOW +++$+++ Copy that, Blue Leader.
sw_L3042 +++$+++ sw_u257 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINCH DALLOW +++$+++  If you get us there, we'll give it to them.
sw_L3043 +++$+++ sw_u258 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++  Copy that.
sw_L3044 +++$+++ sw_u259 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ TEENE +++$+++ Fighters incoming.
sw_L3045 +++$+++ sw_u252 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ TALLIE +++$+++ Gunners, look alive.
sw_L3046 +++$+++ sw_u260 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PILOT 2 +++$+++  Subfighters at 2-10!

sw_L3054 +++$+++ sw_u266 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PILOT 8 +++$+++  Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! We're going down!
sw_L3055 +++$+++ sw_u253 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ CANADY +++$+++ Recharge the auto-cannons. Target their cruiser.
sw_L3056 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ I see it. Tallie, they have targeted the fleet and begun the priming sequence.
sw_L3057 +++$+++ sw_u252 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ TALLIE +++$+++ Copy that. We are almost there. Bombardiers.... begin your drop sequence.
sw_L3058 +++$+++ sw_u267 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ NIX JERD +++$+++ I've got a visual on the target. We are approaching the point of attack. The bombs are armed.
sw_L3059 +++$+++ sw_u256 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ BASCUS +++$+++ Auto cannons aimed.
sw_L3060 +++$+++ sw_u254 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ GONERIL +++$+++ 40 seconds to full charge.
sw_L3061 +++$+++ sw_u253 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ CANADY +++$+++ Destroy that last bomber!
sw_L3062 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Paige, come in. We're over the target. Why aren't your bay doors open? You're the only bomber left. It's all down to you!
sw_L3063 +++$+++ sw_u268 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PAIGE +++$+++ Nix!
sw_L3064 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Paige! Drop the payload, now!
sw_L3065 +++$+++ sw_u257 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINCH DALLOW +++$+++ Look out!
sw_L3066 +++$+++ sw_u268 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PAIGE +++$+++ No!
sw_L3067 +++$+++ sw_u252 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ TALLIE +++$+++ Bombs away!
sw_L3068 +++$+++ sw_u269 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ RESISTANCE MONITOR +++$+++ Direct hit! Dreadnought down!
sw_L3069 +++$+++ sw_u247 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ MONITOR +++$+++ General, Supreme Leader Snoke... is making contact from the ship.
sw_L3070 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Excellent. I'll take it in my chambers.
sw_L3071 +++$+++ sw_u270 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ General Hux.
sw_L3072 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Ah, good.
sw_L3073 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ They can't get away, Supreme Leader. We have them tied on the end of a string.
sw_L3074 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Rey!
sw_L3075 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Well done, pal. "Finn naked leaking bag"? What? Did you fry a chip? Finn! Hey, buddy. It's so good to see you. What? Let's uh... We need to get you dressed. Come on. You must have a thousand questions.
sw_L3076 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Where is Rey?
sw_L3077 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Master Skywalker? Master Skywalker? I'm from the Resistance. Your sister Leia sent me. We need your help. Hello?
sw_L3078 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Go away. Chewie, what are you doing here?
sw_L3079 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ He said you're coming back with us.
sw_L3080 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ How did you find me?
sw_L3081 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Long story we'll tell you in the Falcon.
sw_L3082 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Falcon? Wait. Where is Han?
sw_L3083 +++$+++ sw_u270 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ Tied to a string, indeed, General Hux. Well done. The Resistance will soon be in our grasp.
sw_L3084 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Thank you, Supreme Leader.
sw_L3085 +++$+++ sw_u270 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ Do you wonder why I keep a rabid cur... In a such a place of power? The cur's weakness, properly manipulated... Can be a sharp tool. How's your wound?
sw_L3086 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ It's nothing.
sw_L3087 +++$+++ sw_u270 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ The mighty Kylo Ren. When I found you... I saw what all masters live to see. Raw, untamed power. And beyond that, something truly special. The potential of your bloodline. A new Vader. Now I fear... I was mistaken.
sw_L3088 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Ive given everything I have to you To the dark side.
sw_L3089 +++$+++ sw_u270 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ Take that ridiculous thing off. Yes, there it is. You have too much of your father's heart in you, young Solo.
sw_L3090 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ I killed Han Solo. When the moment came I didn't hesitate.
sw_L3091 +++$+++ sw_u270 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ And look at you, the deed split your spirit to the bone. You were unbalanced... Bested by a girl who had never held a lightsaber! You failed! Skywalker lives. The seed of the Jedi Order lives. As long as it does... Hope lives in the galaxy. I thought you would be the one to snuff it out. Alas, you're no Vader. You're just a child... in a mask.
sw_L3092 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Prepare my ship.
sw_L3093 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ There is no light left in Kylo Ren. He's only getting stronger. The First Order will control all the major systems within weeks. We need your help. We need the Jedi Order back. We need Luke Skywalker.
sw_L3094 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You don't need Luke Skywalker.
sw_L3095 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Did you hear a word I just said?
sw_L3096 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You think what? I'm gonna walk out with a laser sword and face down the whole First Order? What did you think was going to happen here? Do you think that I came... To the most unfindable place in the galaxy for no reason at all? Go away.
sw_L3097 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I'm not leaving without you! Careful!
sw_L3098 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You are wasting your time. Who are you?
sw_L3099 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I know this place.
sw_L3100 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Built a thousand generations ago... to keep these. The original Jedi texts. Just like me, they're the last of the Jedi religion. You've seen this place. You've seen this island.
sw_L3101 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Only in dreams.
sw_L3102 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Who are you?
sw_L3103 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ The Resistance sent me.
sw_L3104 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ They sent you? What is special about you? Where are you from?
sw_L3105 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Nowhere.
sw_L3106 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ No one's from nowhere.
sw_L3107 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Jakku.
sw_L3108 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ All right, that is pretty much nowhere. Why are you here, Rey, from nowhere?
sw_L3109 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ The Resistance sent me. We need your help. The First Order has become unstoppable.
sw_L3110 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Why are you here?
sw_L3111 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Something inside me has always been there Then now it's awake. And I'm afraid. I do not know what it is... or what to do with it. And I need help.
sw_L3112 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You need a teacher. I can't teach you.
sw_L3113 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Why not? I've seen your daily routine. You're not busy.
sw_L3114 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I will never train another generation of Jedi. I came to this island to die. It's time for the Jedi to end.
sw_L3115 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Why? Leia sent me here with hope. If she was wrong, she deserves to know why. We all do.
sw_L3116 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You're demoted.
sw_L3117 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ What? Wait! We took down a dreadnought.
sw_L3118 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ At what cost?
sw_L3119 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ If you start an attack, you follow through.
sw_L3120 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Poe, get your head out of your cockpit. There are things you can not solve... By jumping into an X-wing and blowing something up! I need you to learn that.
sw_L3121 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ There were heroes on that mission.
sw_L3122 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Dead heroes, No leaders.
sw_L3123 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ We're really nowhere. How's Rey going to find us now? A cloaked binary beacon?
sw_L3124 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ To light her way home.
sw_L3125 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Alright, Well, until she comes back, what's the plan?
sw_L3126 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ We need to find a new base.
sw_L3127 +++$+++ sw_u275 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LARMA D'ACY +++$+++ One with enough power to get a distress signal to our allies. scattered in the Outer Rim.
sw_L3128 +++$+++ sw_u276 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ACKBAR +++$+++ Proximity alert!
sw_L3129 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ That's impossible. It's Snoke's ship. You've gotta be kidding me. Can we jump to lightspeed?
sw_L3130 +++$+++ sw_u244 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KAYDEL KO CONNIX +++$+++ We have enough fuel for just one jump.
sw_L3131 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Do it. We have to get out of here.
sw_L3132 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Wait. They tracked us through lightspeed.
sw_L3133 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ That's impossible.
sw_L3134 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Yes. And they've done it.
sw_L3135 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ So if we jump to lightspeed... they'll just find us again, and we'll be out of fuel. They've got us.
sw_L3136 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Not yet, they don't. Permission to jump in an X-wing and blow something up?
sw_L3137 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Permission granted. Admiral, spin us around!
sw_L3138 +++$+++ sw_u276 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ACKBAR +++$+++ Reverse. Rotate the shields!
sw_L3139 +++$+++ sw_u269 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ RESISTANCE MONITOR +++$+++ To your stations! Move, move, move!
sw_L3140 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Follow my lead.
sw_L3141 +++$+++ sw_u277 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ MALE ANNOUNCER +++$+++ Green squadron to launch position. Clear the launch traffic.
sw_L3142 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Don't wait for me! Jump in and fire her up!
sw_L3143 +++$+++ sw_u277 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ MALE ANNOUNCER +++$+++ Technicians, secure supplies for launch conditions.
sw_L3144 +++$+++ sw_u258 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Move! Move!
sw_L3145 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Poe, are you alright?
sw_L3146 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ We need to get outta range of those Star Destroyers.
sw_L3147 +++$+++ sw_u276 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ACKBAR +++$+++ We need to what?
sw_L3148 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Full engines ahead. Get out of range of the Star Destroyers and the fighters will fall back.
sw_L3149 +++$+++ sw_u276 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ACKBAR +++$+++ All craft, full engines! Concentrate rear shields.
sw_L3150 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Ren, the Resistance have pulled out of reach. We can't cover you at this distance. Return to the fleet. What is the point of all this if we can't blow up three tiny cruisers?
sw_L3151 +++$+++ sw_u245 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PEAVEY +++$+++ They are faster and lighter, sir. They can't lose us but they can keep at a range where our cannons are not effective against their shields.
sw_L3152 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Well, keep up the barrage. Let's at least remind them that we're still here.
sw_L3153 +++$+++ sw_u245 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PEAVEY +++$+++ Very good sir.
sw_L3154 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ They won't last long burning fuel like this. It's just a matter of time.
sw_L3155 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Move! Outta the way, everybody! Make way! Make room!
sw_L3156 +++$+++ sw_u278 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ MEDIC DROID +++$+++ Her vital signs are weak, but she is fighting.
sw_L3157 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Artoo? Artoo! Yes. Yes I know. Hey, it's a sacred island, watch the language. Old friend. I wish I could make you understand. But I'm not coming back. Nothing can make me change my mind.
sw_L3158 +++$+++ sw_u279 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA IN HOLOGRAM +++$+++ Years ago, you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. It hurts me not to be able to fulfill my father's request in person...
sw_L3159 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ That was a cheap move.
sw_L3160 +++$+++ sw_u279 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA IN HOLOGRAM +++$+++ But they are attacking my ship... and I fear that my mission to bring you to Alderaan failed. It is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
sw_L3161 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Tomorrow at dawn. Three lessons. I will teach you the ways of the Jedi... and why they need to end.
sw_L3162 +++$+++ sw_u275 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LARMA D'ACY +++$+++ General Organa... Leia... is unconscious but recovering. This is the only good news I have. Admiral Ackbar... all our leadership, they're gone.
sw_L3163 +++$+++ sw_u275 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LARMA D'ACY +++$+++ Leia was the sole survivor on the bridge. If she were here, she'd say save your sorrow for after the fight. And to that end... The chain of command is clear as to who should take her place. Vice Admiral Holdo... of the cruiser Ninka.
sw_L3164 +++$+++ sw_u280 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ AMILYN HOLDO +++$+++ Thank you, Commander. There are four hundred of us... on three ships. We're the very last of the Resistance But we're not alone. In every corner of the galaxy... the downtrodden and oppressed know our symbol... and they put their hope in it. We are the spark that will ignite the fire that will restore the Republic. That spark... this Resistance, must survive. That is our mission. Now, to your stations. And may the Force be with us.
sw_L3165 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ That's Admiral Holdo? Battle of Chyron Belt, Admiral Holdo? Not what I expected. Vice Admiral? Commander Dameron. With our current fuel consumption... there is a very limited amount time... That we will stay out of range of those Star Destroyers.
sw_L3166 +++$+++ sw_u280 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ AMILYN HOLDO +++$+++ Very kind to make me aware.
sw_L3167 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Let's get me those fuel projections. And we need to shake them before we find a new base, so... What's our plan?
sw_L3168 +++$+++ sw_u280 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ AMILYN HOLDO +++$+++ Our plan, captain? Not commander, right? Wasn't it Leia's last official act to demote you? Because of your dreadnought plan... Where we lost our entire bombing fleet?
sw_L3169 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ "Captain." "Commander." You can call me whatever you like. I just want to know what's going on.
sw_L3170 +++$+++ sw_u280 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ AMILYN HOLDO +++$+++ Of course you do. I understand. I've dealt with plenty of trigger happy flyboys like you... You are impulsive. Dangerous. And the last thing we need right now. So stick to your post... and follow my orders. FEMALE P.A.
sw_L3171 +++$+++ sw_u281 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ANNOUNCER +++$+++ Turbo-lifts seven and eight disconnected for maintenance.
sw_L3172 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What are you doing here?
sw_L3173 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Hey, hi. Uh, I was... Uh, you know...
sw_L3174 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You are Finn! The Finn!
sw_L3175 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ The Finn?
sw_L3176 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Sorry... I work behind pipes all day. Doing talking with the Resistance heroes is not my forte. Doing... Doing talking, yeah... I'm Rose.
sw_L3177 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Breathe.
sw_L3178 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ OK.
sw_L3179 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Yeah, look I'm not a Resistance hero, but... It was nice talking to you, Rose. May the Force be with you.
sw_L3180 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Wow. You too. Good. But you are a hero. You left the First Order-what you did on the Starkiller Base. When we heard about it, my sister Paige said... "Rose, that's a real hero." "Know right from wrong.... "and don't run away from when it gets hard," she said. You know... Just this morning, I had to stun... three people who were trying to jump ship. In this escape pod.
sw_L3181 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ What?
sw_L3182 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ They were running away.
sw_L3183 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ That's disgraceful.
sw_L3184 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I know.
sw_L3185 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Anyway, uh... I gotta get back to what I was doing, so.
sw_L3186 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What were you doing?
sw_L3187 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Just, just, uh checks.
sw_L3188 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Checking the escape pods.
sw_L3189 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ No, it's routine checks.
sw_L3190 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ While boarding one... with a packed bag.
sw_L3191 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Okay. Listen, I... I can't move. I can't move.
sw_L3192 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I know.
sw_L3193 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ What happened?
sw_L3194 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm taking you to the bridge and turning you in for desertion.
sw_L3195 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I was not deserting. - I told you that...
sw_L3196 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ My sister just died... protecting the fleet. And you were running away.
sw_L3197 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I'm sorry. This fleet is doomed... If my friend comes back to it, she's doomed too. I've gotta get this... I've gotta get this beacon very far away from here, then she'll find me and be safe.
sw_L3198 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're a selfish traitor.
sw_L3199 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Look, we cannot outrun the First Order fleets.
sw_L3200 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ We can jump to light speed!
sw_L3201 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Well they can track us through lightspeed.
sw_L3202 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ They can track us through lightspeed?
sw_L3203 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Yeah. They'll just show up 30 seconds later and we'll have blown a ton of fuel. Of which, by the way, we're dangerously short on.
sw_L3204 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ They can track us through lightspeed.
sw_L3205 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Yes. And they could... I can't feel my teeth. What did you shoot me with?
sw_L3206 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Active tracking.
sw_L3207 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ What now?
sw_L3208 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ New hyperspace tracking... Hyperspace tracking is a new tactic but the principal must be the same as any active tracker.
sw_L3209 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ So they're just tracking us...
sw_L3210 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Only tracking us...
sw_L3211 +++$+++ sw_u283 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN AND ROSE +++$+++ From the lead ship.
sw_L3212 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ But we can't get to the tracker. It is an A-class process they'll control from the main bridge.
sw_L3213 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Well, I mean, yes, but every A-class process...
sw_L3214 +++$+++ sw_u283 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN AND ROSE +++$+++ Has a dedicated power breaker.
sw_L3215 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ But... Wait, but who knows where the breaker room is on the Star Destroyer?
sw_L3216 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I'm the guy who used to mop it. If I can get us there....
sw_L3217 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I can shut their tracker down.
sw_L3218 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Just give it to me one more time, but simpler.
sw_L3219 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ So the First Order's only tracking us from one Destroyer, the main one.
sw_L3220 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ So we make blow that one up?
sw_L3221 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I like where you're heading, but no. They'd only start tracking us from another Destroyer.
sw_L3222 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ But if we can....
sw_L3223 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ If we sneak on board the lead Destroyer and disable the tracker without them realizing, then we can...
sw_L3224 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ They won't realize if it's for one system cycle. About six minutes.
sw_L3225 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Sneak on board. Disable the tracker Our fleet escapes before they even realize.
sw_L3226 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ How did you two meet?
sw_L3227 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Just luck.
sw_L3228 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Yeah? Good luck?
sw_L3229 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Not sure yet.
sw_L3230 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Poe, we've got to do this It will save the fleet and it'll save Rey.
sw_L3231 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Yeah, you're right, 3PO. It's a need-to-know plan, and she doesn't.
sw_L3232 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ All right... You guys shut down that tracker. I'll be here to jump us to lightspeed. The question is... How do we sneak the two of you onto Snoke's destroyer?
sw_L3233 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ We steal clearance codes.
sw_L3234 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ No, they are Bio-Hexaencripted and rescrambled every hour. We can't get through their security shields undetected. Nobody can.
sw_L3235 +++$+++ sw_u284 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ Could I do it? Of course I could do it. But I can't do it, I'm a little tied down right now.
sw_L3236 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Maz? What is happening?
sw_L3237 +++$+++ sw_u284 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ A union dispute, you do NOT want to hear about it. But, lucky for you... There's exactly one guy I trust that can crush that kind of security! He is a master codebreaker, an ace pilot... a poet with a blaster.
sw_L3238 +++$+++ sw_u284 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ Oh yes, he can. You will find him with a red ploom flower on his lapel... rolling on a high stakes table... in the casino... on Canto Bight.
sw_L3239 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Canto Bight? - No, no. That's... Maz... Is there any way we can take care of this ourselves?
sw_L3240 +++$+++ sw_u284 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ MAZ +++$+++ I'm sorry, kiddo. This is rarified cracking. If you want to get on that Destroyer, I know only one option. Find the master codebreaker.
sw_L3241 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ You'll bring Luke Skywalker to me. You're not doing this. The effort would kill you. Can you see my surroundings?
sw_L3242 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ You are going to pay for what you did!
sw_L3243 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ I can't see yours. Just you. So no. This is something else. Luke.
sw_L3244 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What's that about?
sw_L3245 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I was cleaning my blaster. It went off.
sw_L3246 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Let's get started.
sw_L3247 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Who were those things?
sw_L3248 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Caretakers. Island natives. They've kept up the Jedi structures since they've been built.
sw_L3249 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I don't think they like me.
sw_L3250 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I can't imagine why.
sw_L3251 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Master Skywalker, we need you to bring the Jedi back because Kylo Ren is strong with the dark side of the Force. Without the Jedi, we won't stand a chance against him.
sw_L3252 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What do you know about the Force?
sw_L3253 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ It's a power that Jedi have that lets them control people and make things float.
sw_L3254 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Impressive. Every word in that sentence was wrong. Lesson one, sit here, legs crossed. The Force is not a power you have. It's not about lifting rocks. It's the energy between all things, a tension, a balance, that binds the universe together.
sw_L3255 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ OK. But what is it?
sw_L3256 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Close your eyes. Breathe. Now, reach out.
sw_L3257 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I feel something.
sw_L3258 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You feel it?
sw_L3259 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Yes, I feel it.
sw_L3260 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's the Force.
sw_L3261 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Really?
sw_L3262 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Wow, it must be really strong with you.
sw_L3263 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I've never felt anythi----OW! You meant reach out like.... I'll try again.
sw_L3264 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Breathe. Just breathe. Reach out with your feelings. What do you see?
sw_L3265 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ The island. Life. Death and decay, that feeds new life. Warmth. Cold. Peace. Violence.
sw_L3266 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ And between it all?
sw_L3267 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Balance. And energy. A Force.
sw_L3268 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ And inside you?
sw_L3269 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Inside me the same Force.
sw_L3270 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ And this is the lesson. That Force does not belong to the Jedi. To say that if the Jedi die, the light dies, is vanity. Can you feel that?
sw_L3271 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ There's something else beneath the island. A place. A dark place.
sw_L3272 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Balance. Powerful light, powerful darkness.
sw_L3273 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ It's cold. It's calling me.
sw_L3274 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Resist it, Rey. Rey? Rey! You went straight to the dark.
sw_L3275 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ That place was trying to show me something.
sw_L3276 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It offered you something you needed. And you didn't even try to stop yourself.
sw_L3277 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ But I didn't see you. Nothing from you. You've closed yourself off from the Force. Of course you have.
sw_L3278 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I've seen this raw strength only once before, in Ben Solo. It didn't scare me enough then. It does now.
sw_L3279 +++$+++ sw_u280 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ AMILYN HOLDO +++$+++ What was that?
sw_L3280 +++$+++ sw_u244 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KAYDEL KO CONNIX +++$+++ Nothing, Admiral. Passing debris.
sw_L3281 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ The fleet's only got 18 hours of fuel left. We gotta hurry.
sw_L3282 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Still can't reach the Resistance? Keep at it. If you get through, check their status. And ask about Finn.
sw_L3283 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Why is the Force connecting us? You and I.
sw_L3284 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Murderous snake. You're too late. You lost. I found Skywalker.
sw_L3285 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Did he tell you what happened? The night I destroyed his temple, did he tell you why?
sw_L3286 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I know everything I need to know about you.
sw_L3287 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ You do? Ah, you do. You have that look in your eyes. From the forest. When you called me a monster.
sw_L3288 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ You are a monster.
sw_L3289 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Yes, I am.
sw_L3290 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ OK. We get in, we find this codebreaker, we get out.
sw_L3291 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Do you know this town? Canto Bight?
sw_L3292 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ From stories. It's a terrible place filled with the worst people in the galaxy.
sw_L3293 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Great.
sw_L3294 +++$+++ sw_u285 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SLOWEN LO +++$+++ I told those two, I said, "This is a public beach. You can't park that shuttle." But they just lit off toward the casino.
sw_L3295 +++$+++ sw_u286 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ THAMM +++$+++ Place your bets. Place your bets. All the bets on the table right now, right now! Place your bets here.
sw_L3296 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Aw, yes! This place is great!
sw_L3297 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ OK. Maz says that this Master Codebreaker would have a red plom bloom on his lapel. Let's find him and get out of here.
sw_L3298 +++$+++ sw_u286 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ THAMM +++$+++ Well played. The house wins. Where are your manners, more like?
sw_L3299 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Come on!
sw_L3300 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ We've covered this whole casino. Zero red plom blooms. Where is this guy?
sw_L3301 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Were those what I think they are?
sw_L3302 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ What are those things?
sw_L3303 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Fathiers. I've never seen a real one.
sw_L3304 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Look, this whole place is beautiful. I mean, come on. Why do you hate it so much?
sw_L3305 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Look closer. My sister and I grew up in a poor mining system. The First Order stripped our ore to finance its military.... then shelled us to test their weapons. They took everything we had. And who do you think these people are? There's only one business in the galaxy that'll get you this rich.
sw_L3306 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ War.
sw_L3307 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Selling weapons to the First Order. I wish I could put my fist through this whole lousy, beautiful town. Red plom bloom!
sw_L3308 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Red plom bloom!
sw_L3309 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ The Master Codebreaker!
sw_L3310 +++$+++ sw_u285 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SLOWEN LO +++$+++ Yup, those are the shuttle parkers.
sw_L3311 +++$+++ sw_u287 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ All right, You two are under arrest for parking violation 27B/6. You have the right to remain....
sw_L3312 +++$+++ sw_u288 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LOVEY +++$+++ What was that?
sw_L3313 +++$+++ sw_u289 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ MASTER CODEBREAKER +++$+++ No, no, no. Not now, Lovey. I'm on a roll.
sw_L3314 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Lesson Two. Now that they're extinct, the Jedi are romanticized, defied. But if you strip away the myth and look at their deeds, the legacy of the Jedi is failure. Hypocrisy, hubris.
sw_L3315 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ That's not true.
sw_L3316 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ At the height of their powers, they allowed Darth Sidious to rise, create the Empire, and wipe them out. It was a Jedi Master who was responsible for the training and creation of Darth Vader.
sw_L3317 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ And a Jedi who saved him. Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy. But you saw that there was conflict inside him. You believed that he wasn't gone. That he could be turned.
sw_L3318 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ And I became a legend. For many years, there was balance.... and then I saw Ben. My nephew with that mighty Skywalker blood. And in my hubris, I thought I could train him, I could pass on my strengths. Han was Han about it, but Leia trusted me with her son. I took him, and a dozen students, and began a training temple. By the time I realized I was no match for the darkness rising in him, it was too late.
sw_L3319 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ What happened?
sw_L3320 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I went to confront him. And he turned on me. Ben, no! He must have thought I was dead. When I came to, the temple was burning. He had vanished with a handful of my students. And slaughtered the rest. Leia blamed Snoke, but it was me. I failed. Because I was Luke Skywalker. Jedi master. A legend.
sw_L3321 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ The galaxy may need a legend. I need someone to show me my place in all this. And you didn't fail Kylo. Kylo failed you. I won't.
sw_L3322 +++$+++ sw_u245 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PEAVEY +++$+++ The main cruiser's still keeping beyond range. But their medical frigate is out of fuel and its shields are down.
sw_L3323 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ The beginning of their end. Destroy it.
sw_L3324 +++$+++ sw_u244 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KAYDEL KO CONNIX +++$+++ Admiral, fuel reserves at six hours.
sw_L3325 +++$+++ sw_u280 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ AMILYN HOLDO +++$+++ Maintain our current course. Steady on.
sw_L3326 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Finn, Rose, where are you guys?
sw_L3327 +++$+++ sw_u287 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Deal me in. Thanks.
sw_L3328 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Finn, the fleet is running on fumes. Without a codebreaker to break us onto Snoke's Star Destroyer.... what do we do?
sw_L3329 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I don't know. Unless you got a thief in your pocket, our plan is shot.
sw_L3330 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Um, I can do it.
sw_L3331 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What?
sw_L3332 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ What?
sw_L3333 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What?
sw_L3334 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ S-S-S-Sorry, I'm just couldn't help but overhear all the stuff that you were saying really loudly while I trying to sleep. Codebreaker? Thief? I can do it.
sw_L3335 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I'm not talking about picking pockets, OK?
sw_L3336 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Yeah. D-D-D-Don't let the wrapper fool you, friend. Me and the First Order codeage go way back. And, if the price is right, I could break you into old man S-S-S-Snoke's boudoir.
sw_L3337 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ No.
sw_L3338 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ We're.... We've got it covered.
sw_L3339 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Ha-tuk-ga.
sw_L3340 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Did he just....?
sw_L3341 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yeah. We gotta get outta here! This way!
sw_L3342 +++$+++ sw_u287 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Why, you little....
sw_L3343 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ D-D-D-Did you do this?
sw_L3344 +++$+++ sw_u287 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Hey, hands up! Hands up!
sw_L3345 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Yeah, man. What's your story, roundie?
sw_L3346 +++$+++ sw_u291 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ They went this way! Lock down all the exits.
sw_L3347 +++$+++ sw_u292 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ COP #2 +++$+++ Wait.
sw_L3348 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ That smells great. Those cops will be here any minute. What now? Whoa! Ooh!
sw_L3349 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No, wait. Please stop! We're with the Resistance.
sw_L3350 +++$+++ sw_u291 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ Roger that. Checking the stables now.
sw_L3351 +++$+++ sw_u292 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ COP #2 +++$+++ This way.
sw_L3352 +++$+++ sw_u293 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ COP #3 +++$+++ They must have come through here.
sw_L3353 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Hyah! TEMIRI BLAGG - Go, go, go! Whoo!
sw_L3354 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Stop enjoying this, stop enjoying this!
sw_L3355 +++$+++ sw_u294 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SPEEDER PILOT +++$+++ We've got them. They aren't going anywhere.
sw_L3356 +++$+++ sw_u283 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN AND ROSE +++$+++ Ahhhh!
sw_L3357 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Huh?
sw_L3358 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Move, move, move! Get outta the way!
sw_L3359 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Our ship's on the beach straight ahead! We need cover! Too much cover! There it is!
sw_L3360 +++$+++ sw_u283 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN AND ROSE +++$+++ No!
sw_L3361 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Come on!
sw_L3362 +++$+++ sw_u294 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SPEEDER PILOT +++$+++ Let the flock go. Stick with the perps. Where'd they go?
sw_L3363 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I think we lost them! Now we go down to the beach and circle back around....
sw_L3364 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Cliff! We're trapped.
sw_L3365 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ It was worth it, though. To tear up that town, make 'em hurt.
sw_L3366 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Go. Now, it's worth it.
sw_L3367 +++$+++ sw_u294 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SPEEDER PILOT +++$+++ There they are.
sw_L3368 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ BB-8! Wait, are you flying that thing?
sw_L3369 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ N-N-N-Need a lift?
sw_L3370 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Luke.
sw_L3371 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Leia.
sw_L3372 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I'd rather not do this now.
sw_L3373 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Yeah, me too.
sw_L3374 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Why did you hate your father? Do you have something, a cowl or something you can put on? Why did you hate your father? Give me an honest answer. You had a father who loved you, he gave a damn about you.
sw_L3375 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ I didn't hate him.
sw_L3376 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Then why?
sw_L3377 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Why, what? Why, what? Say it.
sw_L3378 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Why did you... Why did you kill him? I don't understand.
sw_L3379 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ No? Your parents threw you away like garbage.
sw_L3380 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ They didn't!
sw_L3381 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ They did. But you can't stop needing them. It's your greatest weakness. Looking for them everywhere.... in Han Solo.... now in Skywalker. Did he tell you what happened that night?
sw_L3382 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Yes.
sw_L3383 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ No. He had sensed my power, as he senses yours. And he feared it.
sw_L3384 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Liar.
sw_L3385 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Let the past die. Kill it if you have to. That's the only way to become what you were meant to be.
sw_L3386 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ No! No!
sw_L3387 +++$+++ sw_u295 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FEMALE VOICE +++$+++ Rey?
sw_L3388 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I should have felt trapped or panicked. But I didn't. This didn't go on forever, I knew it was leading somewhere. And that, at the end, it would show me what I came to see.
sw_L3389 +++$+++ sw_u295 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FEMALE VOICE +++$+++ Rey.
sw_L3390 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Let me see them. My parents... please. I thought I'd find answers here. I was wrong.
sw_L3391 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Neither are you.
sw_L3392 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Rey?
sw_L3393 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ It isn't too late.
sw_L3394 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Stop!
sw_L3395 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ It is true? Did you try to murder him?
sw_L3396 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Leave this island now!
sw_L3397 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Stop. Stop! Did you do it? Did you create Kylo Ren? Tell me the truth.
sw_L3398 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I saw darkness. I'd sensed it building in him. I'd see it at moments during his training. But then I looked inside... and it was beyond what I ever imagined. Snoke had already turned his heart. He would bring destruction, and pain, and death... and the end of everything I love because of what he will become. And for the briefest moment of pure instinct... I thought I could stop it. It passed like a fleeting shadow. And I was left with shame... and with consequence. And the last thing I saw... were the eyes of a frightened boy whose master had failed him. Ben, no!
sw_L3399 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ You failed him by thinking his choice was made It wasn't There is still conflict in him If he turned from the dark side, that could shift the tide. This could be how we win.
sw_L3400 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ This is not going to go the way you think.
sw_L3401 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ It is. Just now, when we touched hands... I saw his future. As solid as I'm seeing you. If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn.
sw_L3402 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Rey... don't do this.
sw_L3403 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Then he is our last hope.
sw_L3404 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Master Yoda.
sw_L3405 +++$+++ sw_u296 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Young Skywalker.
sw_L3406 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'm ending all of this. The tree, the text, the Jedi. I'm going to burn it down.
sw_L3407 +++$+++ sw_u296 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Hmm.  Ah, Skywalker, missed you, have I.
sw_L3408 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ So it is time for the Jedi Order to end.
sw_L3409 +++$+++ sw_u296 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Time it is. For you to look at a pile of old books, hmmm?
sw_L3410 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ The sacred Jedi texts!
sw_L3411 +++$+++ sw_u296 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Oh. Read them, have you?
sw_L3412 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well, I...
sw_L3413 +++$+++ sw_u296 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Page-turners they were not. Yes, yes, yes. Wisdom they held, but that library contained nothing that the girl Rey does not already possess. Skywalker, still looking to the horizon. Never here, now, hmmm?  The need in front of your nose. Hmmm?
sw_L3414 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I was weak. Unwise.
sw_L3415 +++$+++ sw_u296 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Lost Ben Solo, you did. Lose Rey, we must not.
sw_L3416 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I can't be what she needs me to be.
sw_L3417 +++$+++ sw_u296 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Heeded my words not, did you? Pass on what you have learned. Strength, mastery. But weakness, folly, falure, also. Yes, failure most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is. Luke, we are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.
sw_L3418 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Four parsecs to go. This thing really cooks.
sw_L3419 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I just hope we're in time. You can actually do this, right?
sw_L3420 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Yeah, about that... Guys, I can do it. But there exists a pre-"do it" conversation about price.
sw_L3421 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Once we're done, the Resistance will give you whatever you want.
sw_L3422 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ What you got deposit-wise?
sw_L3423 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Are you kidding me? Look at us.
sw_L3424 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Is that Haysian smelt? That's something.
sw_L3425 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ No, we gave you our word. You're gonna get paid. That should be enough.
sw_L3426 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Guys, I wanna keep helping. But no something, n-n-n-no doing.
sw_L3427 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ OK, listen here, you've gotta....
sw_L3428 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Do it.
sw_L3429 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Now I can help.
sw_L3430 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Give it back.
sw_L3431 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ What?
sw_L3432 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Give it back! You have no idea how much that medallion means to her. What are you.... Why are you ransacking your own ship? It's not your ship.
sw_L3433 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ He says I stole it.
sw_L3434 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Yeah, I got that.
sw_L3435 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ We stole it.
sw_L3436 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ At least you're stealing from the bad guys and helping the good.
sw_L3437 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Good guys, bad guys, made-up words. Let's see who formally owned this gorgeous hunk-uh. Ah, this guy was an arms dealer. Made his bank selling weapons to the bad guys. Oh.... and the good. Finn, let me learn you something big. It's all a machine, partner. Live free, don't join.
sw_L3438 +++$+++ sw_u245 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PEAVEY +++$+++ That was the last of their support ships. It's just their main cruiser now.
sw_L3439 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ And their fuel reserve?
sw_L3440 +++$+++ sw_u245 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PEAVEY +++$+++ By our calculations.... critical.
sw_L3441 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ She in there?
sw_L3442 +++$+++ sw_u275 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LARMA D'ACY +++$+++ The Admiral's banned you from the bridge. Let's not have a scene.
sw_L3443 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ No, let's. Holdo?
sw_L3444 +++$+++ sw_u297 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LARMA +++$+++ You're not allowed in here.
sw_L3445 +++$+++ sw_u298 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ HOLDO +++$+++ Flyboy.
sw_L3446 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Cut it, lady. We had a fleet, now we're down to one ship, and you've told us nothing! Tell us that we have a plan! That there's hope!
sw_L3447 +++$+++ sw_u298 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ HOLDO +++$+++ When I served under Leia, she would say, hope is like the sun. If you only believe in it when you can see it....
sw_L3448 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ You'll never make it through the night.
sw_L3449 +++$+++ sw_u298 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ HOLDO +++$+++ Yes.
sw_L3450 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Are you fueling up the transports? You are. All of them? We're abandoning ship? Is that.... That's what you got? That's what you brought us to? Coward! Those transports ships are unarmed, unshielded. We abandon this cruiser, we're done. We don't stand a chance. No, you are not just a coward, you are a traitor.
sw_L3451 +++$+++ sw_u298 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ HOLDO +++$+++ Get this man off my bridge.
sw_L3452 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Finn, Holdo's loading the crew in the shuttles. She's going to abandon ship. Where are you?
sw_L3453 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Poe, we're on our way back to the fleet. We're so close.
sw_L3454 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Did you find the Master Codebreaker?
sw_L3455 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ We found a codebreaker. We can shut the tracker down. Just buy us a little more time.
sw_L3456 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ All right, hurry.
sw_L3457 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ As soon as I launch, you jump back out of range. Stay there until you get my signal for where to rendezvous. If you see Finn before I do, tell him... Yeah, perfect. Tell him that.
sw_L3458 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Cloaking our approach. We should be off their scopes. Then we slice a slit in their shield. Blip bloppity bloop, and slip right through.
sw_L3459 +++$+++ sw_u280 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ AMILYN HOLDO +++$+++ So a stormtrooper, and a who now are doing what?
sw_L3460 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ They are trying to save us. This is our best chance for escape. You have to give Finn and Rose all the time that you can.
sw_L3461 +++$+++ sw_u280 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ AMILYN HOLDO +++$+++ You have bet the survival of the Resistance on bad odds and put us all at risk? There's no time now. We have to get clear of the cruiser. Load the transports.
sw_L3462 +++$+++ sw_u299 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ CREW MEMBER +++$+++ Right away, Admiral.
sw_L3463 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that. Vice Admiral Holdo, I am relieving you of your command for the survival of this ship, its crew, and the Resistance.
sw_L3464 +++$+++ sw_u280 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ AMILYN HOLDO +++$+++ I hope you understand what you're doing.
sw_L3465 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Yeah. I'm going to the bridge. If they move, stun them.
sw_L3466 +++$+++ sw_u300 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ OFFICER #1 +++$+++ ....at least three cycles so far.
sw_L3467 +++$+++ sw_u301 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ OFFICER #2 +++$+++ Yes, sir. We're working on it.
sw_L3468 +++$+++ sw_u302 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ OFFICER #3 +++$+++ I will do my best, sir.
sw_L3469 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Almost there.
sw_L3470 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ You don't have to do this. I feel the conflict in you. It's tearing you apart. Ben, when we touched hands, I saw your future. Just the shape of it, but solid and clear. You will not bow before Snoke. You will turn. I'll help you. I saw it.
sw_L3471 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ I saw something, too. Because of what I saw, I know when the moment comes, you'll be the one to turn. You'll stand with me. Rey, I saw who your parents are.
sw_L3472 +++$+++ sw_u270 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ Well done, my good and faithful apprentice. My faith in you is restored. Young Rey. Welcome.
sw_L3473 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ So this is it? The tracker's right behind this door.
sw_L3474 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Haysian smelt. Best conductor. And you're welcome.
sw_L3475 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Good time to figure out how to get back to the fleet?
sw_L3476 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I know where the nearest escape pods are.
sw_L3477 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Course you do.
sw_L3478 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ BB-8, tell me something good.
sw_L3479 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Poe, we're almost there. Have the cruiser prepped for lightspeed.
sw_L3480 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Yeah, I'm on it pal. You just hurry. Clear the bridge, escort the officers down to the hangar.
sw_L3481 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Yeah, we spoke.
sw_L3482 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Good instinct, 3PO. Go with that. Seal that door!
sw_L3483 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ We're running out of time.
sw_L3484 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Come on, how's it going?
sw_L3485 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Almost there.
sw_L3486 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ 3PO, where do you think you're going?
sw_L3487 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Hey!
sw_L3488 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Finn? We're ready to make the jump.
sw_L3489 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Now or never.
sw_L3490 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Now.
sw_L3491 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ You're up.
sw_L3492 +++$+++ sw_u303 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER #1 +++$+++ You there, hands up!
sw_L3493 +++$+++ sw_u304 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER #2 +++$+++ Watch 'em, watch 'em.
sw_L3494 +++$+++ sw_u305 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER #3 +++$+++ Drop your weapons, now!
sw_L3495 +++$+++ sw_u306 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER #4 +++$+++ Hands up, Rebel scum.
sw_L3496 +++$+++ sw_u305 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ STORMTROOPER #3 +++$+++ Get down! I said, down!
sw_L3497 +++$+++ sw_u307 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PHASMA +++$+++ FN-2187. So good to have you back.
sw_L3498 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ They didn't make it. Leia.
sw_L3499 +++$+++ sw_u281 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ANNOUNCER +++$+++ Please board the transports according to your evacuation designation. All transports must be cleared....
sw_L3500 +++$+++ sw_u308 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ GURNEY OPERATOR +++$+++ OK, help me push him up, guys.
sw_L3501 +++$+++ sw_u280 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ AMILYN HOLDO +++$+++ That one's a troublemaker. I like him.
sw_L3502 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Me, too. Now, time to board your transport.
sw_L3503 +++$+++ sw_u280 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ AMILYN HOLDO +++$+++ For the transports to escape, someone needs to stay behind and pilot the cruiser.
sw_L3504 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Too many losses. I can't take anymore.
sw_L3505 +++$+++ sw_u280 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ AMILYN HOLDO +++$+++ Sure you can. You taught me how.
sw_L3506 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You go on. I've said it enough.
sw_L3507 +++$+++ sw_u280 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ AMILYN HOLDO +++$+++ May the Force be with you always.
sw_L3508 +++$+++ sw_u258 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Cloaking device activated. We should be off their scopes.
sw_L3509 +++$+++ sw_u275 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LARMA D'ACY +++$+++ Let's hope this works.
sw_L3510 +++$+++ sw_u270 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ Come closer, child. So much strength. Darkness rises, and light to meet it. I warned my young apprentice that as he grew stronger, his equal in the light would rise. Skywalker.... I assumed. Wrongly. Closer, I said.
sw_L3511 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ You underestimate Skywalker, and Ben Solo, and me. It will be your downfall.
sw_L3512 +++$+++ sw_u270 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ Oh.... have you seen something? A weakness in my apprentice. Is that why you came? Young fool. It was I who bridged your minds. I stoked Ren's conflicted soul. I knew he was not strong enough to hide it from you. And you were not wise enough to resist the bait. And now, you will give me Skywalker. Then I will kill you with the cruelest stroke.
sw_L3513 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ No.
sw_L3514 +++$+++ sw_u270 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ Yes. Give me everything.
sw_L3515 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ No! No! No!
sw_L3516 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ No. No. No, no, no!
sw_L3517 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Poe.
sw_L3518 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ What is that?
sw_L3519 +++$+++ sw_u275 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LARMA D'ACY +++$+++ The mineral planet, Crait. An uncharted hideout from the days of the Rebellion.
sw_L3520 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ That's a Rebel base?
sw_L3521 +++$+++ sw_u275 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LARMA D'ACY +++$+++ Abandoned, but heavily armored with enough power to get a distress signal to our allies scattered in the Outer Rim.
sw_L3522 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Holdo knew the First Order was tracking our big ship. They're not monitoring for little transports.
sw_L3523 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ So we could slip down to the surface unnoticed and hide till the First Order passes. That could work.
sw_L3524 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ She was more interested in protecting the light than she was seeming like a hero.
sw_L3525 +++$+++ sw_u280 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ AMILYN HOLDO +++$+++ Godspeed, Rebels.
sw_L3526 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Well done, Phasma.
sw_L3527 +++$+++ sw_u307 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PHASMA +++$+++ Your ship and payment, as we agreed.
sw_L3528 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You lying snake.
sw_L3529 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ We got caught, I cut a d-d-d-deal.
sw_L3530 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Wait, cut a deal with what?
sw_L3531 +++$+++ sw_u309 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FIRST ORDER OFFICER +++$+++ Sir, we checked on the information from the thief. We ran a decloaking scan, and sure enough, 30 Resistance transports have just launched from the cruiser.
sw_L3532 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ He told us the truth. Will wonders never cease?
sw_L3533 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No.
sw_L3534 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Our weapons are ready?
sw_L3535 +++$+++ sw_u309 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FIRST ORDER OFFICER +++$+++ Ready and aimed, sir.
sw_L3536 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Fire at will.
sw_L3537 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Wait. No, no. No, you can't!
sw_L3538 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No!
sw_L3539 +++$+++ sw_u258 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Admiral, we're taking fire! Do we turn around?
sw_L3540 +++$+++ sw_u280 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ AMILYN HOLDO +++$+++ No, you're too far out. Full speed to planetfall. Full speed!
sw_L3541 +++$+++ sw_u270 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ Well, well, I did not expect Skywalker to be so wise. We will give him and the Jedi Order the death he desires. After the Rebels are gone, we will go to his planet and obliterate the entire island. Such spunk. Look here now. The entire Resistance on those transports. Soon they will all be gone. For you, all is lost. Ooh. And still that fiery spit of hope. You have the spirit of a true Jedi! And because of that, you must die. My worthy apprentice, son of darkness, heir apparent to Lord Vader. Where there was conflict, I now sense resolve. Where there was weakness, strength. Complete your training, and fulfill your destiny.
sw_L3542 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ I know what I have to do.
sw_L3543 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Ben.
sw_L3544 +++$+++ sw_u270 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SNOKE +++$+++ You think you can turn him? Pathetic child. I cannot be betrayed, I cannot be beaten. I see his mind, I see his every intent. Yes. I see him turning the lightsaber to strike true. And now, foolish child, he ignites it, and kills his true enemy!
sw_L3545 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Come on, give it full thrusters. Full speed!
sw_L3546 +++$+++ sw_u310 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ COVA NELL +++$+++ I am, sir.
sw_L3547 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ You murdering bastard!
sw_L3548 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ T-T-T-Take it easy, Big F. They blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow. It's just business.
sw_L3549 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ You're wrong.
sw_L3550 +++$+++ sw_u290 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Maybe.
sw_L3551 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Ben! The fleet. Order them to stop firing. There's still time to save the fleet. Ben?
sw_L3552 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ It's time to let old things die. Snoke, Skywalker. The Sith, the Jedi, the Rebels.... let it all die. Rey. I want you to join me. We can rule together and bring a new order to the galaxy.
sw_L3553 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Don't do this, Ben. Please don't go this way.
sw_L3554 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ No, no. You're still holding on! Let go! Do you wanna know the truth about your parents? Or have you always known? And you've just hidden it away. You know the truth. Say it. Say it.
sw_L3555 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ They were nobody.
sw_L3556 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ They were filthy junk traders who sold you off for drinking money. They're dead in a paupers' grave in the Jakku desert. You have no place in this story. You come from nothing. You're nothing. But not to me. Join me. Please.
sw_L3557 +++$+++ sw_u309 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FIRST ORDER OFFICER +++$+++ Sir, the Resistance cruiser's preparing to jump to lightspeed.
sw_L3558 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ It's empty. They're just trying to pull our attention away. Pathetic. Keep your fire on the transports.
sw_L3559 +++$+++ sw_u307 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PHASMA +++$+++ Execution by blaster is too good for them. Let's make this hurt.
sw_L3560 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Finn.
sw_L3561 +++$+++ sw_u307 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PHASMA +++$+++ On my command.
sw_L3562 +++$+++ sw_u244 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KAYDEL KO CONNIX +++$+++ She's running away.
sw_L3563 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ No, she isn't.
sw_L3564 +++$+++ sw_u311 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ EDRISON PEAVEY +++$+++ No!
sw_L3565 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Fire on that cruiser!
sw_L3566 +++$+++ sw_u307 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PHASMA +++$+++ Execute.
sw_L3567 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Finn! There's a shuttle back that way! We gotta go!
sw_L3568 +++$+++ sw_u307 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PHASMA +++$+++ Traitor! What?
sw_L3569 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Finn!
sw_L3570 +++$+++ sw_u307 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PHASMA +++$+++ You are a bug in the system.
sw_L3571 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Let's go, chrome-dome. Come on!
sw_L3572 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No!
sw_L3573 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Hey.
sw_L3574 +++$+++ sw_u307 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ PHASMA +++$+++ You were always scum.
sw_L3575 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Rebel scum.
sw_L3576 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Hey! Need a lift?
sw_L3577 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ What happened?
sw_L3578 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ The girl murdered Snoke. What happened?
sw_L3579 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ She took Snoke's escape craft.
sw_L3580 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ We know where she's going. Get all our forces down to that Resistance base. Let's finish this.
sw_L3581 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Finish this? Who do you think you're talking to? You presumed to command my army? Our Supreme Leader is dead! We have no ruler!
sw_L3582 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ The Supreme Leader is dead.
sw_L3583 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Long live the Supreme Leader.
sw_L3584 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ They're coming, shut the door.
sw_L3585 +++$+++ sw_u312 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ RESISTANCE SOLDIER +++$+++ Incoming!
sw_L3586 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Go, go, move! Get that shield door down!
sw_L3587 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No! Wait, don't shoot! It's us! No, don't shoot!
sw_L3588 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Hold your fire!
sw_L3589 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Don't shoot!
sw_L3590 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Hold your fire!
sw_L3591 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Finn?
sw_L3592 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Finn! Rose! You're not dead! Where's my droid? Buddy! I'm so glad to see you! Wait, what? Wait, wait, wait, slow down.
sw_L3593 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Is this all that's left?
sw_L3594 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ All right, our shields are up so they can't hit us from orbit. Use whatever power we've got left to broadcast a distress signal to the Outer Rim.
sw_L3595 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Use my personal code. If there are any allies to the Resistance, it's now or never.
sw_L3596 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Rose, what do you got?
sw_L3597 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Rotting munitions, rusted artillery, some half-gutted skim speeders.
sw_L3598 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Well, let's just pray that big-ass door holds long enough for us to get help.
sw_L3599 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ A battering ram cannon.
sw_L3600 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ A what now?
sw_L3601 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Miniaturized Death Star tech. It'll crack that door open like an egg.
sw_L3602 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ There has to be a back way out of here, right?
sw_L3603 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ BB-8, what do you got?
sw_L3604 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Come on. We have allies. People believe in Leia. They'll get our message, they'll come. But we have to buy time. We gotta take out that cannon.
sw_L3605 +++$+++ sw_u313 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SOLDIER #1 +++$+++ On me! On me!
sw_L3606 +++$+++ sw_u314 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SOLDIER #2 +++$+++ Move! Move!
sw_L3607 +++$+++ sw_u315 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ RESISTANCE TROOPER +++$+++ Go back! Gather your weapons!
sw_L3608 +++$+++ sw_u316 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ #3: Get over here!
sw_L3609 +++$+++ sw_u317 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SOLDIER #4 +++$+++ Hold your fire!
sw_L3610 +++$+++ sw_u318 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SALTY +++$+++ Salt.
sw_L3611 +++$+++ sw_u319 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SOLDIER #5 +++$+++ Ground forces, incoming.
sw_L3612 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Copy that, on our way.
sw_L3613 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Engage your mono-ski. The green toggle.
sw_L3614 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ All right, listen up. I don't like these rust buckets and I don't like our odds, but.... what the hell? Just keep it tight and don't get drawn in too close till they roll that cannon up front. All right, ground forces, lay down some fire!
sw_L3615 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ 13 incoming light craft. Shall we hold until we clear them?
sw_L3616 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ No. The Resistance is in that mine. Push through.
sw_L3617 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Fighters, break off! Come on! We gotta hold them till they pull up that cannon!
sw_L3618 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Rose, you've got 3 right behind you!
sw_L3619 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I can't lose 'em!
sw_L3620 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Whoo! Yeah!
sw_L3621 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Whoo! I like this!
sw_L3622 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Blow that piece of junk out of the sky!
sw_L3623 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ All fighters!
sw_L3624 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Chewie, pull off from the battle. Draw them away from the speeders.
sw_L3625 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ She drew 'em off! All of 'em!
sw_L3626 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Oh, they hate that ship!
sw_L3627 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Chewie!
sw_L3628 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ There it is! That is a big gun.
sw_L3629 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ OK, it's heavily armored. Our only shot is right down the throat. The cannon's opening. This is our chance.
sw_L3630 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ All firepower on those speeders.
sw_L3631 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Concentrate all fire on the speeders!
sw_L3632 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ They're picking us all off. We're not gonna make it.
sw_L3633 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ All right, making my final approach. Target in sight, guns are hot.
sw_L3634 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ No! Pull off!
sw_L3635 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ What?
sw_L3636 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ The cannon is charged! It's a suicide run! All craft, pull away!
sw_L3637 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ No! I'm almost there!
sw_L3638 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Retreat, Finn! That's an order!
sw_L3639 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Finn? It's too late! Don't do this!
sw_L3640 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ No! I won't let them win!
sw_L3641 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No! Finn, listen to Poe! We have to retreat!
sw_L3642 +++$+++ sw_u320 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ MALE SCOUT +++$+++ The cannon is warming up now.
sw_L3643 +++$+++ sw_u321 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ MALE COMMANDER +++$+++ Copy that. We see it.
sw_L3644 +++$+++ sw_u320 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ MALE SCOUT +++$+++ Preparing to fire.
sw_L3645 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Move! Go, go! Quick!
sw_L3646 +++$+++ sw_u316 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ Let's go, let's go!
sw_L3647 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Rose? Rose? Rose? Why would you do that? Huh? I was almost there. Why would you stop me?
sw_L3648 +++$+++ sw_u282 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I saved you, dummy. That's how we're gonna win. Not fighting what we hate, saving what we love.
sw_L3649 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ General Hux, advance. No quarter. No prisoners.
sw_L3650 +++$+++ sw_u244 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KAYDEL KO CONNIX +++$+++ Our distress signal's been received at multiple points, but no response.
sw_L3651 +++$+++ sw_u275 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LARMA D'ACY +++$+++ They've heard us, but no one's coming.
sw_L3652 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ We fought till the end. But the galaxy has lost all its hope. The spark is out. Luke. I know what you're gonna say. I changed my hair.
sw_L3653 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's nice that way. Leia, I'm sorry.
sw_L3654 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I know. I know you are. I'm just glad you're here at the end.
sw_L3655 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I came to face him, Leia. And I can't save him.
sw_L3656 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I held out hope for so long, but I know my son is gone.
sw_L3657 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ No one's ever really gone.
sw_L3658 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Stop! I want every gun we have to fire on that man. Do it. More! More!
sw_L3659 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ That's enough. That's enough! Do you think you got him? Now, if we're ready to get moving, we can finish this.
sw_L3660 +++$+++ sw_u322 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SHUTTLE PILOT +++$+++ Sir?
sw_L3661 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Bring me down to him. Keep the door covered and don't advance until I say.
sw_L3662 +++$+++ sw_u246 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ ARMITAGE HUX +++$+++ Supreme Leader, don't get distracted, our goal....
sw_L3663 +++$+++ sw_u322 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ SHUTTLE PILOT +++$+++ Right away, sir.
sw_L3664 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Med pack! I need a med pack!
sw_L3665 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ She's hurt pretty bad. It's Kylo Ren. Luke's facing him alone.
sw_L3666 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Well, we should help him. Let's go.
sw_L3667 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ No, wait. Wait.
sw_L3668 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ Did you come back to say you forgive me? To save my soul?
sw_L3669 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ No.
sw_L3670 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ He's doing this for a reason. He's stalling so we can escape.
sw_L3671 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Escape? He's one man against an army. We have to help him, we have to fight.
sw_L3672 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ No, no. We are the spark that'll light the fire that will burn the First Order down. Skywalker's doing this so we can survive. There's gotta be a way out of this mine. Hell, how did he get in here?
sw_L3673 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Shh. Shush. Hush. Shush up. Shut up!
sw_L3674 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Listen.
sw_L3675 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Exactly.
sw_L3676 +++$+++ sw_u271 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Where'd the crystal critters go?
sw_L3677 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Follow me.
sw_L3678 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ What are you looking at me for? Follow him.
sw_L3679 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ If the beacon's right beneath us, they've gotta be somewhere. Keep scanning for life forms.
sw_L3680 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ This way.
sw_L3681 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ I see them! Chewie, there!
sw_L3682 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ No. No, no, no. No!
sw_L3683 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Lifting rocks.
sw_L3684 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I failed you, Ben. I'm sorry.
sw_L3685 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ I'm sure you are! The Resistance is dead. The war is over. And when I kill you, I will have killed the last Jedi.
sw_L3686 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Amazing. Every word of what you just said was wrong. The Rebellion is reborn today. The war is just beginning. And I will not be the last Jedi.
sw_L3687 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ I'll destroy her, and you, and all of it.
sw_L3688 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ No. Strike me down in anger and I'll always be with you. Just like your father.
sw_L3689 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ No.
sw_L3690 +++$+++ sw_u273 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ See you around, kid.
sw_L3691 +++$+++ sw_u274 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KYLO REN +++$+++ No!
sw_L3692 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ C'ai!
sw_L3693 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Chewie!
sw_L3694 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ It looks good.
sw_L3695 +++$+++ sw_u244 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ KAYDEL KO CONNIX +++$+++ That was crazy, man.
sw_L3696 +++$+++ sw_u248 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ POE +++$+++ Hi.

sw_L3701 +++$+++ sw_u275 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LARMA D'ACY +++$+++ When we get to the Outer Rim, I have a contact there.
sw_L3702 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ Luke is gone. I felt it. But it wasn't sadness or pain. It was peace and purpose.
sw_L3703 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I felt it, too.
sw_L3704 +++$+++ sw_u272 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ REY +++$+++ How do we build a Rebellion from this?
sw_L3705 +++$+++ sw_u249 +++$+++ sw_m4 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++  We have everything we need.
