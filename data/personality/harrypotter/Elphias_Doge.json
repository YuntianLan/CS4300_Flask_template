This made Elphias friendly towards Dumbledore. Doge has appeared as being a very loyal friend.[4] He also disliked unfairness, as he got angry when Muriel falsely claimed that Ariana Dumbledore was a Squib and that her family had imprisoned her.[8] Doge also appeared as being a friend of the most members of the Order of the Phoenix, such as James and Lily Potter.[6] Rita Skeeter heavily implies Doge to be senile or \"dim-witted\",[4] but this was most likely spiteful slander of his character because of his refusal to help her in her biography of Albus Dumbledore;[8] the post he held within the Ministry, that of Special Advisor to the Wizengamot suggested otherwise, implying that he was a highly intelligent, knowledgeable and wise wizard indeed.[4]\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
