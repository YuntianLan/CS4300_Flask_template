Crookshanks was also very playful and enjoyed catching spiders[17], chasing gnomes[18], and attacking chess pieces.[19]\n", "He was affectionate with those he liked and acted as a shield to Sirius, when Harry Potter was planning to kill him. He eventually came to like Harry and would sit on his lap on occasion, as he did in the summer of 1996. However, he could be moody towards those who threw him off their lap, no matter if it was accidental or deliberate.\n"], "personality_quotes": [["\"Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?\"", "—Hermione Granger after Crookshanks caught a spider[src]\n"]], "figure_captions": ["Crookshanks determining if Ron's new owl Pigwidgeon is an Animagus"], "quote": ["He's the most intelligent of his kind I've ever met.", "—Crookshanks' advanced intelligence\n", "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"], "description": "Crookshanks was Hermione Granger's pet cat.
