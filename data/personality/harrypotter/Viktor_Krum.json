Viktor also responded well to those that treated him fairly or impressed him. Cedric Diggory was always polite to him, and Viktor was saddened by Cedric's death. Viktor was also impressed by Harry Potter's flying skills during the First Task. Harry also considered Viktor to be \"a lot tougher than he looked\" after seeing him dive into Black Lake in January.[9] He also has very little patience with people who insulted the deaths of his beloved ones, as he felt highly insulted by Durmstrang students who copied the mark of Grindelwald, the dark wizard who killed Viktor's grandfather, and was furious when he saw Xenophilius Lovegood wearing the symbol.\n"], "quotes": [["\"He's really nice, you know. He's not at all like you'd think, coming from Durmstrang.\"", "â€”Viktor's pleasant personality[src]\n"]], "figure_captions": []}
