{"id": "Antioch_Peverell", "name": "Antioch Peverell", "fandom": "harrypotter", "url": "https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Antioch_Peverell", "personality": ["According to The Tale of the Three Brothers, Antioch was a man who desired beyond everything to be an all powerful wizard. Although he was already very powerful, he was not satisfied and immediately took his chance to gain a wand from Death that would make him unbeatable. \n", "Antioch's desire for such power made him blind to Death's true intentions, however, and he later proved to be very self-indulgent and weak-willed when he boasted about how powerful his new wand was to the public. Antioch was very irresponsible and unwise in this manner, consuming a dangerous amount of alcohol then leaving his wand and himself unprotected on the night of his murder. Antioch's recklessness and egotism caused him to be the first of the Peverell brothers to fall into Death's cunning hands.\n", "It is possible that the depiction of his personality was just fictionalised by Beedle, and it was unknown what his true personality was. It is possible that his true personality, like Cadmus, was nobler than what is depicted by Beedle. It should be noted his creation, the Elder Wand, contains a Thestral tail hair as its core, a substance that those who are capable of accepting (and not afraid of) death could handle. Since Antioch must do so in order to create the Elder Wand, and those who accept death turn out to be noble and selfless (in the case of Harry Potter), it can be assumed that Antioch is indeed a noble person while simply a little too boastful.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": ["Antioch brags of his ownership of the Elder Wand"]}
