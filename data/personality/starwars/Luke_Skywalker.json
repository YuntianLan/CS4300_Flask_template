{"id": "Luke_Skywalker", "name": "Luke Skywalker", "fandom": "starwars", "url": "https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker", "personality": ["In his youth, Skywalker was often curious, impatient, looking ahead to the future with little regard for his present surroundings, and even a bit brash.[81] Like his father, he was impulsive, reckless, and often had little regard for his own personal safety.[1] Some time after the Battle of Yavin, he would confer with Nakari Kelen that he regretted his behavior before then, acknowledging he complained \"about everything\" because of his desire to escape from Tatooine.[31] He also acknowledged his scarce talent at lying,[31] a trait that many people could infer.[36] Despite these traits, Skywalker had a happy childhood anyway.[81]\n", "However, as his skills in the Force progressed and, especially after losing a hand to Darth Vader, Skywalker became more patient and seasoned, and was often seen as having wisdom beyond his years.[13][26] However, he still retained his idealistic viewpoint, willing to think the best of anyone,[31] and believing that Vader was redeemable.[13] He was also unable to ignore those who needed help, sometimes to the point of endangering missions for the sake of saving someone else's life, as his father would throughout the Clone Wars.[12][31] Even as a child, he had a strong sense of morality and a need to help others despite likely danger.[20] Skywalker shows consistently throughout the series his sense to protect those that he cares for and loves, for example risking going to the dark side to help his friends, and his love for his sister very nearly causing him to turn, if it were not for his love for his father.\n", "After his nephew, Ben Solo, betrayed him and killed most of his apprentices, Luke became embittered as well as grief-ridden and chose to exile himself to the planet Ahch-To, where he would spend the rest of his life in with the intention of dying where the Jedi began to forever end the Jedi. He also became more cautious in teaching others of immense power due to Ben's betrayal, feeling finished with the Jedi Order,[84] as evidenced when he initially refused to train Rey and would later decide to abruptly end their lessons after seeing her starting to turn to the dark side. He also now believed that there was no hope for those who fell to the dark side, as shown when he openly expressed that he believed there was no hope for Kylo to return to the light.[6]\n", "However, after Yoda's spirit encouraged him that Rey was the Jedi's hope, Luke finally realized his wrongs and chose to help the Resistance. Despite his lost faith in his nephew, Luke showed great remorse for failing to stop his fall to the dark side, and for himself ending up being the turning point in Ben's fall. In the end, Luke willingly sacrificed himself for the Jedi to be revived and the Resistance to live on. Luke passed away on Ahch-To shortly after, having made peace with his failures and having no regrets.[6]\n"], "quotes": [["\"This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away…to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!\"", "―Yoda[src]"]], "figure_captions": ["Luke Skywalker was once a farm boy who longed for a more exciting life.", "In his later years, Skywalker lived in exile as a grief-ridden and embittered hermit."]}
