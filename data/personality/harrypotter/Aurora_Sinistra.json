She feared the Dark Lord Voldemort and her Boggart assumed his form.[4]She was also proven to have been a highly competent teacher, as her lessons inspected by Dolores Umbridge were deemed satisfactory enough that she was not subject to displinary action by her. Her competency as a teacher was also proven by how she taught her subject for at least ten years at Hogwarts, showing her to be highly experienced and skilled in her field. \n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
