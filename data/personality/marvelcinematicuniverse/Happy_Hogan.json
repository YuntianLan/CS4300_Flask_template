He also acted as Stark's \"pre-screener\" when Stark was womanizing.[6] An example of this was when he described reporter Christine Everhart as \"cute\".[4]\nHogan initially was annoyed by and ignored Peter Parker by not replying to his messages and being rude to him even when Parker was serious about Adrian Toomes actions. He later apologized to Peter for not taking him seriously and thanked him for saving his job.\n"], "quotes": [], "figure_captions": []}
